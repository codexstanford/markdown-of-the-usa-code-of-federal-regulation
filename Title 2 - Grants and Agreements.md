# Title 2 - Grants and Agreements

## Subtitle A - Office of Management and Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements

### PART 1 - ABOUT TITLE 2 OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SUBTITLE A

#### Subpart A - Introduction to Title 2 of the CFR

##### § 1.100 Content of this title.

This title contains&#x2014;

(a) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to Federal agencies on government-wide policies and procedures for the award and administration of grants and agreements; and

(b) Federal agency regulations implementing that OMB guidance.

##### § 1.105 Organization and subtitle content.

(a) This title is organized into two subtitles.

(b) The OMB guidance described in § 1.100(a) is published in subtitle A. Publication of the OMB guidance in the CFR does not change its nature&#x2014;it is guidance and not regulation.

(c) Each Federal agency that publishes regulations implementing the OMB guidance has a chapter in subtitle B in which it issues those regulations. The Federal agency regulations in subtitle B differ in nature from the OMB guidance in subtitle A because the OMB guidance is not regulatory (Federal agency regulations in subtitle B may give regulatory effect to the OMB guidance, to the extent that the agency regulations require compliance with all or portions of the guidance).

##### § 1.110 Issuing authorities.

OMB issues this subtitle. Each Federal agency that has a chapter in subtitle B of this title issues that chapter.

#### Subpart B - Introduction to Subtitle A

##### § 1.200 Purpose of chapters I and II.

(a) Chapters I and II of subtitle A provide OMB guidance to Federal agencies that helps ensure consistent and uniform government-wide policies and procedures for management of the agencies' grants and agreements.

(b) There are two chapters for publication of the guidance because portions of it may be revised as a result of ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify requirements for the award and administration of grants and other financial assistance (and thereby implement the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106&#x2013;107).

(c) The OMB guidance in its initial form&#x2014;before completion of revisions described in paragraph (b) of this section&#x2014;is published in chapter II of this subtitle. When revisions to a part of the guidance are finalized, that part is published in chapter I and removed from chapter II.

##### § 1.205 Applicability to grants and other funding instruments.

The types of instruments that are subject to the guidance in this subtitle vary from one portion of the guidance to another (note that each part identifies the types of instruments to which it applies). All portions of the guidance apply to grants and cooperative agreements, some portions also apply to other types of financial assistance or nonprocurement instruments, and some portions also apply to procurement contracts. For example, the:

(a) Guidance on debarment and suspension in part 180 of this subtitle applies broadly to all financial assistance and other nonprocurement transactions, and not just to grants and cooperative agreements.

(b) Cost principles in parts 220, 225 and 230 of this subtitle apply to procurement contracts, as well as to financial assistance, although those principles are implemented for procurement contracts through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in title 48 of the CFR, rather than through Federal agency regulations on grants and agreements in this title.

##### § 1.210 Applicability to Federal agencies and others.

(a) This subtitle contains guidance that directly applies only to Federal agencies.

(b) The guidance in this subtitle may affect others through each Federal agency's implementation of the guidance, portions of which may apply to&#x2014;

(1) The agency's awarding or administering officials;

(2) Non-Federal entities that receive or apply for the agency's grants or agreements or receive subawards under those grants or agreements; or

(3) Any other entities involved in agency transactions subject to the guidance in this chapter.

##### § 1.215 Relationship to previous issuances.

Although some of the guidance was organized differently within OMB circulars or other documents, much of the guidance in this subtitle existed prior to the establishment of title 2 of the CFR. Specifically:

##### § 1.220 Federal agency implementation of this subtitle.

A Federal agency that awards grants and agreements subject to the guidance in this subtitle implements the guidance in agency regulations in subtitle B of this title and/or in policy and procedural issuances, such as internal instructions to the agency's awarding and administering officials. An applicant or recipient would see the effect of that implementation in the organization and content of the agency's announcements of funding opportunities and in its award terms and conditions.

##### § 1.230 Maintenance of this subtitle.

OMB issues guidance in this subtitle after publication in theAny portion of the guidance that has a potential impact on the public is published with an opportunity for public comment.

#### Subpart C - Responsibilities of OMB and Federal Agencies

##### § 1.300 OMB responsibilities.

OMB is responsible for:

(a) Issuing and maintaining the guidance in this subtitle, as described in § 1.230.

(b) Interpreting the policy requirements in this subtitle.

(c) Reviewing Federal agency regulations implementing the requirements of this subtitle, as required by Executive Order 12866.

(d) Conducting broad oversight of government-wide compliance with the guidance in this subtitle.

(e) Performing other OMB functions specified in this subtitle.

##### § 1.305 Federal agency responsibilities.

The head of each Federal agency that awards and administers grants and agreements subject to the guidance in this subtitle is responsible for:

(a) Implementing the guidance in this subtitle.

(b) Ensuring that the agency's components and subcomponents comply with the agency's implementation of the guidance.

(c) Performing other functions specified in this subtitle.

### Chapter I - Office of Management and Budget Governmentwide Guidance for Grants and Agreements

#### PARTS 2-24 [RESERVED]

#### PART 25 - UNIVERSAL IDENTIFIER AND SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 25.100 Purposes of this part.

This part provides guidance to Federal awarding agencies to establish:

(a) The unique entity identifier as a universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct subrecipients, and;

(b) The System for Award Management (SAM) as the repository for standard information about applicants and recipients.

###### § 25.105 Types of awards to which this part applies.

This part applies to a Federal awarding agency's grants, cooperative agreements, loans, and other types of Federal financial assistance as defined in § 25.406.

###### § 25.110 Exceptions to this part.

(a)Through a Federal awarding agency's implementation of the guidance in this part, this part applies to all applicants and recipients of Federal awards, other than those exempted by statute or exempted in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that apply for or receive agency awards.

(b)None of the requirements in this part apply to an individual who applies for or receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person (unrelated to any business or nonprofit organization he or she may own or operate in his or her name).

(c)(1) Under a condition identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a Federal awarding agency may exempt an applicant or recipient from an applicable requirement to obtain a unique entity identifier and register in the SAM, or both.

(i) In that case, the Federal awarding agency must use a generic unique entity identifier in data it reports toif reporting for a prime award to the recipient is required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (Pub. L. 109&#x2013;282, hereafter cited as “Transparency Act”).

(ii) Federal awarding agency use of a generic unique entity identifier should be used rarely for prime award reporting because it prevents prime awardees from being able to fulfill the subaward or executive compensation reporting required by the Transparency Act.

(2) The conditions under which a Federal awarding agency may exempt an applicant or recipient are&#x2014;

(i) For any applicant or recipient, if the Federal awarding agency determines that it must protect information about the entity from disclosure if it is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, or to avoid jeopardizing the personal safety of the applicant or recipient's staff or clients.

(ii) For a foreign organization or foreign public entity applying for or receiving a Federal award or subaward for a project or program performed outside the United States valued at less than $25,000, if the Federal awarding agency deems it to be impractical for the entity to comply with the requirement(s). This exemption must be determined by the Federal awarding agency on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach and does not apply if subawards are anticipated.

(iii) For an applicant, if the Federal awarding agency makes a determination that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a unique entity identifier and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal awarding agencies must require the recipient to obtain a unique entity identifier and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the Federal award date.

(3) Federal awarding agencies' use of generic unique entity identifier, as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, should be rare. Having a generic unique entity identifier limits a recipient's ability to use Governmentwide systems that are needed to comply with some reporting requirements.

(d)OMB may allow exceptions for classes of Federal awards, applicants, and recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute.

##### Subpart B - Policy

###### § 25.200 Requirements for notice of funding opportunities, regulations, and application instructions.

(a) Each Federal awarding agency that awards the types of Federal financial assistance defined in § 25.406 must include the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section in each notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance containing instructions for applicants that is issued on or after August 13, 2020.

(b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that applies and does not have an exemption under § 25.110 to:

(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information, including information on a recipient's immediate and highest level owner and subsidiaries, as well as on all predecessors that have been awarded a Federal contract or grant within the last three years, if applicable, at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency; and

(3) Provide its unique entity identifier in each application or plan it submits to the Federal awarding agency.

(c) For purposes of this policy:

(1) The applicant meets the Federal awarding agency's eligibility criteria and has the legal authority to apply and to receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a unique entity identifier. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal awarding agency program but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the unique entity identifier of the lead applicant will be used.

(2) A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a “program announcement,” “notice of funding availability,” “broad agency announcement,” “research announcement,” “solicitation,” or some other term.

(3) To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the applicant is required to review and update its information in the SAM database on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

###### § 25.205 Effect of noncompliance with a requirement to obtain a unique entity identifier or register in the SAM.

(a) A Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award or financial modification to an existing Federal award to an applicant or recipient until the entity has complied with the requirements described in § 25.200 to provide a valid unique entity identifier and maintain an active SAM registration with current information (other than any requirement that is not applicable because the entity is exempted under § 25.110).

(b) At the time a Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, if the intended recipient has not complied with an applicable requirement to provide a unique entity identifier or maintain an active SAM registration with current information, the Federal awarding agency:

(1) May determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award; and

(2) May use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant.

###### § 25.210 Authority to modify agency application forms or formats.

To implement the policies in §§ 25.200 and 25.205, a Federal awarding agency may add a unique entity identifier field to information collections previously approved by OMB, without having to obtain further approval to add the field.

###### § 25.215 Requirements for agency information systems.

Each Federal awarding agency that awards Federal financial assistance (as defined in § 25.406) must ensure that systems processing information related to the Federal awards, and other systems as appropriate, are able to accept and use the unique entity identifier as the universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants and recipients.

###### § 25.220 Use of award term.

(a) To accomplish the purposes described in § 25.100, a Federal awarding agency must include in each Federal award (as defined in § 25.405) the award term in appendix A to this part.

(b) A Federal awarding agency may use different letters and numbers than those in appendix A to this part to designate the paragraphs of the Federal award term, if necessary, to conform the system of paragraph designations with the one used in other terms and conditions in the Federal awarding agency's Federal awards.

##### Subpart C - Recipient Requirements of Subrecipients

###### § 25.300 Requirement for recipients to ensure subrecipients have a unique entity identifier.

(a) A recipient may not make a subaward to a subrecipient unless that subrecipient has obtained and provided to the recipient a unique entity identifier. Subrecipients are not required to complete full SAM registration to obtain a unique entity identifier.

(i) The title “Buy American Exception under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009”;

(ii) The dollar value and brief description of the project; and

(iii) A detailed written justification as to why the restriction is being waived.

###### § 176.90 Acquisitions covered under international agreements.

Section 1605(d) of the Recovery Act provides that the Buy American requirement in section 1605 shall be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements.

(a) The Buy American requirement set out in § 176.70 shall not be applied where the iron, steel, or manufactured goods used in the project are from a Party to an international agreement, listed in paragraph (b) of this section, and the recipient is required under an international agreement, described in the appendix to this subpart, to treat the goods and services of that Party the same as domestic goods and services. As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more and projects that are not specifically excluded from the application of those agreements.

(b) The international agreements that obligate recipients that are covered under an international agreement to treat the goods and services of a Party the same as domestic goods and services and the respective Parties to the agreements are:

###### § 176.100 Timely determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act.

(a) The head of the Federal department or agency involved may make a determination regarding inapplicability of section 1605 to a particular case or to a category of cases.

(b) Before Recovery Act funds are awarded by the Federal agency or obligated by the recipient for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work, an applicant or recipient may request from the award official a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act for specifically identified items.

(c) The time for submitting the request and the information and supporting data that must be included in the request are to be specified in the agency's and recipient's request for applications and/or proposals, and as appropriate, in other written communications. The content of those communications should be consistent with the notice in § 176.150 or § 176.170, whichever applies.

(d) The award official must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.

(e) In making a determination based on the increased cost to the project of using domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, the award official must compare the total estimated cost of the project using foreign iron, steel and/or relevant manufactured goods to the estimated cost if all domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods were used. If use of domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods would increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent, then the award official shall determine that the cost of the domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods is unreasonable.

###### § 176.110 Evaluating proposals of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

(a) If the award official receives a request for an exception based on the cost of certain domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods being unreasonable, in accordance with § 176.80, then the award official shall apply evaluation factors to the proposal to use such foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods as follows:

(1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total estimated cost of the project, if the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods are to be used in the project based on an exception for unreasonable cost requested by the applicant.

(2) Total evaluated cost = project cost estimate + (.25 &#xD7; project cost estimate, if paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies).

(b) Applicants or recipients also may submit alternate proposals based on use of equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods to avoid possible denial of Recovery Act funding for the proposal if the Federal Government determines that an exception permitting use of the foreign item(s) does not apply.

(c) If the award official makes an award to an applicant that proposed foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods not listed in the applicable notice in the request for applications or proposals, then the award official must add the excepted materials to the list in the award term.

###### § 176.120 Determinations on late requests.

(a) If a recipient requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act after obligating Recovery Act funds for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair (late request), the recipient must explain why it could not request the determination before making the obligation or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the award official concludes that the recipient should have made the request before making the obligation, the award official may deny the request.

(b) The award official must base evaluation of any late request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act on information required by § 176.150(c) and (d) or § 176.170(c) and (d) and/or other readily available information.

(c) If a determination, under § 176.80 is made after Recovery Act funds were obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official must amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis of the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods the award official shall adjust the award amount or the budget, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in § 176.110(a).

###### § 176.130 Noncompliance.

The award official must&#x2014;

(a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act;

(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the recipient of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and

(c) If the review reveals that a recipient or subrecipient has used foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:

(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act in accordance with § 176.120.

(2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

(3) If removal and replacement of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in a public building or a public work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Federal Government, the award official may determine in writing that the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not affect the Federal Government's right to reduce the amount of the award by the cost of the steel, iron, or manufactured goods that are used in the project or to take enforcement or termination action in accordance with the agency's grants management regulations.

(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate remedies, such as withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency, suspending or terminating the award, and withholding further awards for the project. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with the agency's debarment rule implementing 2 CFR part 180. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.

If the recipient does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the award official need not make a determination.

(2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award amount or redistribute budgeted funds by at least the differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).

(3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods is noncompliant with section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).

(b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.

##### Subpart D - Single Audit Information for Recipients of Recovery Act Funds

###### § 176.200 Procedure.

The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.

###### § 176.210 Award term - Recovery Act transactions listed in Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and Recipient Responsibilities for Informing Subrecipients.

The award term described in this section shall be used by agencies to clarify recipient responsibilities regarding tracking and documenting Recovery Act expenditures:

(a) To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111&#x2013;5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements” and OMB Circular A&#x2013;102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A&#x2013;102 is available at

(b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A&#x2013;133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations,” recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF&#x2013;SAC) required by OMB Circular A&#x2013;133. OMB Circular A&#x2013;133 is available atThis shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF&#x2013;SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix “ARRA-” in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF&#x2013;SAC.

(c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing program.

(d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

##### § 176.10 Purpose of this part.

This part establishes Federal Governmentwide award terms for financial assistance awards, namely, grants, cooperative agreements, and loans, to implement the cross-cutting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111&#x2013;5 (Recovery Act). These requirements are cross-cutting in that they apply to more than one agency's awards.

##### § 176.20 Agency responsibilities (general).

(a) In any assistance award funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, the award official shall indicate that the award is being made under the Recovery Act, and indicate what projects and/or activities are being funded under the Recovery Act. This requirement applies whenever Recovery Act funds are used, regardless of the assistance type.

(b) To maximize transparency of Recovery Act funds required for reporting by the assistance recipient, the award official shall consider structuring assistance awards to allow for separately tracking Recovery Act funds.

(c) Award officials shall ensure that recipients comply with the Recovery Act requirements of Subpart A. If the recipient fails to comply with the reporting requirements or other award terms, the award official or other authorized agency action official shall take the appropriate enforcement or termination action in accordance with 2 CFR 215.62 or the agency's implementation of the OMB Circular A&#x2013;102 grants management common rule. OMB Circular A&#x2013;102 is available at

(d) The award official shall make the recipient's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the recipient's performance record.

##### § 176.30 Definitions.

#### PARTS 177-179 [RESERVED]

#### PART 180 - OMB GUIDELINES TO AGENCIES ON GOVERNMENTWIDE DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT)

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 180.100 How are subparts A through I organized?

(a) Each subpart contains information related to a broad topic or specific audience with special responsibilities, as shown in the following table:

(b) The following table shows which subparts may be of special interest to you, depending on who you are:

###### § 180.105 How is this part written?

(a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use. The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.

(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

(c) The “Covered Transactions” diagram in the appendix to this part shows the levels or “tiers” at which a Federal agency may enforce an exclusion.

###### § 180.110 Do terms in this part have special meanings?

This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. Those terms are defined in subpart I of this part. For example, three important terms are&#x2014;

(a)which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);

(b)which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of a Federal agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and

(c)which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.

###### § 180.115 What do Subparts A through I of this part do?

Subparts A through I of this part provide for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provide for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order or other legal authority.

###### § 180.120 Do subparts A through I of this part apply to me?

Portions of subparts A through I of this part (see table at § 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a&#x2014;

(a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;

(b) Respondent (a person against whom a Federal agency has initiated a debarment or suspension action);

(c) Federal agency debarring or suspending official; or

(d) Federal agency official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

###### § 180.125 What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

(a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.

(b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.

(c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

###### § 180.130 How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

With the exceptions stated in §§ 180.135, 315, and 420, a person who is excluded by any Federal agency may not:

(a) Be a participant in a Federal agency transaction that is a covered transaction; or

(b) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.

###### § 180.135 May a Federal agency grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

(a) A Federal agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the agency head or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

(b) An exception granted by one Federal agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another Federal agency.

###### § 180.140 Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

If any Federal agency excludes a person under Executive Order 12549 or Executive Order 12689, on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible for Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.

###### § 180.145 Does an exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal agencies' nonprocurement covered transactions. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.

###### § 180.150 Against whom may a Federal agency take an exclusion action?

Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, a Federal agency may exclude any person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be a participant or principal in a covered transaction.

###### § 180.155 How do I know if a person is excluded?

Check the Governmentwide System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions) to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the SAM Exclusions and makes it available, as detailed in Subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the SAM Exclusions.

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 180.200 What is a covered transaction?

A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at&#x2014;

(a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

(b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

###### § 180.205 Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

The importance of whether a transaction is a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

(a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

(b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

(c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless&#x2014;

(1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 180.310 or § 180.415; or

(2) A Federal agency official obtains an exception from the agency head or designee to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 180.135.

###### § 180.210 Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 180.970, are covered transactions unless listed in the exemptions under § 180.215.

###### § 180.215 Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

(a) A direct award to&#x2014;

(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

(2) A public international organization;

(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

(c) Federal employment.

(d) A transaction that a Federal agency needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

(e) A permit, license, certificate or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety or the environment, unless a Federal agency specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

(g) Any other transaction if&#x2014;

(1) The application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law; or

(2) A Federal agency's regulation exempts it from coverage under this part.

(h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, covered transactions must include non-procurement and procurement transactions involving entities engaged in activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in a country's non-compliance with its obligations under arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements or commitments with the United States. Federal awarding agencies and primary tier non-procurement recipients must not award, renew, or extend a non-procurement transaction or procurement transaction, regardless of amount or tier, with any entity listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions List on the basis of involvement in activities that violate arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements or commitments with the United States, pursuant to section 1290 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, unless the head of a Federal agency grants an exception pursuant to 2 CFR 180.135 with the concurrence of the OMB Director.

###### § 180.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part&#x2014;

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.

(c) A subcontract also is a covered transaction if,&#x2014;

(1) It is awarded by a participant in a procurement transaction under a nonprocurement transaction of a Federal agency that extends the coverage of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to additional tiers of contracts (see the diagram in the appendix to this part showing that optional lower tier coverage); and

(2) The value of the subcontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

###### § 180.225 How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the Federal agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate Federal agency official or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions Doing Business With Other Persons

###### § 180.300 What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?

When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:

(a) Checking SAM Exclusions; or

(b) Collecting a certification from that person; or

(c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person.

###### § 180.305 May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person?

(a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person, unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.

(b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or regulation.

###### § 180.310 What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.

###### § 180.315 May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.

###### § 180.320 Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?

Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction.

You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not required to, check SAM Exclusions.

###### § 180.325 What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?

If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded person, the Federal agency responsible for your transaction may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.

###### § 180.330 What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to&#x2014;

(a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless the regulation of the Federal agency responsible for the transaction requires you to use specific methods.

(b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions

###### § 180.400 May I enter into a transaction with an excluded or disqualified person?

(a) You as a Federal agency official may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person unless you obtain an exception under § 180.135.

(b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.

###### § 180.405 May I enter into a covered transaction with a participant if a principal of the transaction is excluded?

As a Federal agency official, you may not enter into a covered transaction with a participant if you know that a principal of the transaction is excluded, unless you obtain an exception under § 180.135.

###### § 180.410 May I approve a participant's use of the services of an excluded person?

After entering into a covered transaction with a participant, you as a Federal agency official may not approve a participant's use of an excluded person as a principal under that transaction, unless you obtain an exception under § 180.135.

###### § 180.415 What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

(a) You as a Federal agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 180.135.

###### § 180.420 May I approve a transaction with an excluded or disqualified person at a lower tier?

If a transaction at a lower tier is subject to your approval, you as a Federal agency official may not approve&#x2014;

(a) A covered transaction with a person who is currently excluded, unless you obtain an exception under § 180.135; or

(b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.

###### § 180.425 When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

As a Federal agency official, you must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you&#x2014;

(a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;

(b) Approve a principal in a primary tier covered transaction;

(c) Approve a lower tier participant if your agency's approval of the lower tier participant is required; or

(d) Approve a principal in connection with a lower tier transaction if your agency's approval of the principal is required.

###### § 180.430 How do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways:

(a) You as a Federal agency official must check SAM Exclusions when you take any action listed in § 180.425.

(b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as required by § 180.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.

###### § 180.435 What must I require of a primary tier participant?

You as a Federal agency official must require each participant in a primary tier covered transaction to&#x2014;

(a) Comply with subpart C of this part as a condition of participation in the transaction; and

(b) Communicate the requirement to comply with subpart C of this part to persons at the next lower tier with whom the primary tier participant enters into covered transactions.

###### § 180.440 What action may I take if a primary tier participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person, you as a Federal agency official may refer the matter for suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any other appropriate remedy.

###### § 180.445 What action may I take if a primary tier participant fails to disclose the information required under § 180.335?

If you as a Federal agency official determine that a participant failed to disclose information, as required by § 180.335, at the time it entered into a covered transaction with you, you may&#x2014;

(a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

(b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

###### § 180.450 What action may I take if a lower tier participant fails to disclose the information required under § 180.355 to the next higher tier?

If you as a Federal agency official determine that a lower tier participant failed to disclose information, as required by § 180.355, at the time it entered into a covered transaction with a participant at the next higher tier, you may pursue any remedies available to you, including the initiation of a suspension or debarment action.

##### Subpart E - System for Award Management Exclusions

###### § 180.500 What is the purpose of the System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions)?

SAM Exclusions is a widely available source of the most current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.

###### § 180.505 Who uses SAM Exclusions?

(a) Federal agency officials use SAM Exclusions to determine whether to enter into a transaction with a person, as required under § 180.430.

(b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use SAM Exclusions to determine if&#x2014;

(1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, as required under § 180.320; or

(2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.

(c) Sam Exclusions are available to the general public.

###### § 180.510 Who maintains SAM Exclusions?

The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains SAM Exclusions. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into SAM Exclusions.

###### § 180.515 What specific information is in SAM Exclusions?

(a) At a minimum, SAM Exclusions indicates&#x2014;

(1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded and disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if more than one name is involved in a single action;

(2) The type of action;

(3) The cause for the action;

(4) The scope of the action;

(5) Any termination date for the action;

(6) The Federal agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of contact for the action; and

(7) The unique entity identifier approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if available.

(b)(1) The database for SAM Exclusions includes a field for the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.

(2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

###### § 180.520 Who places the information into SAM Exclusions?

Federal agency officials who take actions to exclude persons under this part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified persons must enter the following information about those persons into SAM Exclusions:

(a) Information required by § 180.515(a);

(b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an individual, if the number is available and may be disclosed under law;

(c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, within three business days, after&#x2014;

(1) Taking an exclusion action;

(2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;

(3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or

(4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person who is listed as disqualified.

###### § 180.525 Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person in SAM Exclusions?

If you have questions about a listed person in SAM Exclusions, ask the point of contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into SAM Exclusions. You may find the agency point of contact from SAM Exclusions.

###### § 180.530 Where can I find SAM Exclusions?

You may access SAM Exclusions through the Internet, currently at.

##### Subpart F - General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions

###### § 180.600 How do suspension and debarment actions start?

When Federal agency officials receive information from any source concerning a cause for suspension or debarment, they will promptly report it and the agency will investigate. The officials refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to their suspending or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.

###### § 180.605 How does suspension differ from debarment?

Suspension differs from debarment in that&#x2014;

###### § 180.610 What procedures does a Federal agency use in suspension and debarment actions?

In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, a Federal agency handles the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.

(a) For suspension actions, a Federal agency uses the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.

(b) For debarment actions, a Federal agency uses the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.

###### § 180.615 How does a Federal agency notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?

(a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of&#x2014;

(1) You or your identified counsel; or

(2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.

##### Subpart G - Suspension

###### § 180.700 When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that&#x2014;

(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 180.800(a), or

(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 180.800(b) through (d); and

(c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

###### § 180.705 What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

###### § 180.710 When does a suspension take effect?

A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

(d) Of the cause(s) upon which the suspending official relied under § 180.700 for imposing suspension;

(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision.

(b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

###### § 180.745 How is fact-finding conducted?

###### § 180.755 When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record.

(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.

(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.

(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.

###### § 180.865 How long may my debarment last?

The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension established by section 4 of E.O. 12549 recommends to the OMB any needed revisions to the guidelines in this part. The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidelines in thefor public comment, considers comments with the help of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, and issues the final guidelines.

##### § 180.45 Do these guidelines cover persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

A Federal agency may add a subpart covering disqualifications to its regulation implementing these guidelines, but the guidelines in subparts A through I of this part&#x2014;

(a) Address disqualified persons only to&#x2014;

(1) Provide for their inclusion in SAM Exclusions; and

(2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

(b) Do not specify the&#x2014;

(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

###### § 182.105 Do terms in this part have special meanings?

This part uses terms that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart F of this part.

##### § 183.10 Applicability.

(a) This part applies only to grants and cooperative agreements that are expected to exceed $50,000 and that are performed outside the United States, including U.S. territories, and that are in support of a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities. It does not apply to the authorized intelligence or law enforcement activities of the Federal Government.

(b) All elements of this part are applicable until the date of expiration as provided in law.

##### § 183.15 Responsibilities of Federal awarding agencies.

(a) Prior to making an award for a covered grant or cooperative agreement (see also § 183.35), the Federal awarding agency must check the current list of prohibited or restricted persons or entities in the System Award Management (SAM) Exclusions.

(b) The Federal awarding agency may include the award term provided in appendix A of this part in all covered grant and cooperative agreement awards in accordance with Never Contract with the Enemy.

(c) A Federal awarding agency may become aware of a person or entity that:

(1) Provides funds, including goods and services, received under a covered grant or cooperative agreement of an executive agency directly or indirectly to covered persons or entities; or

(2) Fails to exercise due diligence to ensure that none of the funds, including goods and services, received under a covered grant or cooperative agreement of an executive agency are provided directly or indirectly to covered persons or entities.

(d) When a Federal awarding agency becomes aware of such a person or entity, it may do any of the following actions:

(1) Restrict the future award of all Federal contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements to the person or entity based upon concerns that Federal awards to the entity would provide grant funds directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity.

(2) Terminate any contract, grant, or cooperative agreement to a covered person or entity upon becoming aware that the recipient has failed to exercise due diligence to ensure that none of the award funds are provided directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity.

(3) Void in whole or in part any grant, cooperative agreement or contracts of the executive agency concerned upon a written determination by the head of contracting activity or other appropriate official that the grant or cooperative agreement provides funds directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity.

(e) The Federal awarding agency must notify recipients in writing regarding its decision to restrict all future awards and/or to terminate or void a grant or cooperative agreement. The agency must also notify the recipient in writing about the recipient's right to request an administrative review (using the agency's procedures) of the restriction, termination, or void of the grant or cooperative agreement within 30 days of receiving notification.

##### § 183.20 Reporting responsibilities of Federal awarding agencies.

(a) If a Federal awarding agency restricts all future awards to a covered person or entity, it must enter information on the ineligible person or entity into SAM Exclusions as a prohibited or restricted source pursuant to Subtitle E, Title VIII of the NDAA for FY 2015 (Pub. L. 113&#x2013;291).

(b) When a Federal awarding agency terminates or voids a grant or cooperative agreement due to Never Contract with the Enemy, it must report the termination as a Termination for Material Failure to Comply in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)).

(c) The Federal awarding agency shall document and report to the head of the executive agency concerned (or the designee of such head) and the commander of the covered combatant command concerned (or specific deputies):

(1) Any action to restrict all future awards or to terminate or void an award with a covered person or entity.

(2) Any decision not to restrict all future awards, terminate, or void an award along with the agency's reasoning for not taking one of these actions after the agency became aware that a person or entity is a prohibited or restricted source.

(d) Each report referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall include:

(1) The executive agency taking such action.

(2) An explanation of the basis for the action taken.

(3) The value of the terminated or voided grant or cooperative agreement.

(4) The value of all grants and cooperative agreements of the executive agency with the person or entity concerned at the time the grant or cooperative agreement was terminated or voided.

(e) Each report referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall include:

(1) The executive agency concerned.

(2) An explanation of the basis for not taking the action.

(f) For each instance in which an executive agency exercised the additional authority to examine recipient and lower tier entity (subrecipient or contractor) records, the agency must report in writing to the head of the executive agency concerned (or the designee of such head) and the commander of the covered combatant command concerned (or specific deputies) the following:

(1) An explanation of the basis for the action taken; and

(2) A summary of the results of any examination of records.

##### § 183.25 Responsibilities of recipients.

(a) Recipients of covered grants or cooperative agreements must fulfill the requirements outlined in the award term provided in appendix A to this part.

(b) Recipients must also flow down the provisions in award terms covered in appendix A to this part to all contracts and subawards under the award.

##### § 183.30 Access to records.

In addition to any other existing examination-of-records authority, the Federal Government is authorized to examine any records of the recipient and its subawards, to the extent necessary, to ensure that funds, including supplies and services, received under a covered grant or cooperative agreement (see § 183.35) are not provided directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity in accordance with Never Contract with the Enemy. The Federal awarding agency may only exercise this authority upon a written determination by the Federal awarding agency that relies on a finding by the commander of a covered combatant command that there is reason to believe that funds, including supplies and services, received under the grant or cooperative agreement may have been provided directly or indirectly to a covered person or entity.

#### PARTS 184-199 [RESERVED]

### Chapter II - Office of Management and Budget Guidance

#### PART 200 - UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS

##### Subpart A - Acronyms and Definitions

##### Subpart B - General Provisions

###### § 200.100 Purpose.

(a)(1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards to non-Federal entities, as described in § 200.101. Federal awarding agencies must not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in §§ 200.102 and 200.211, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive order.

(2) This part provides the basis for a systematic and periodic collection and uniform submission by Federal agencies of information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It prescribes the manner in which General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies that administer Federal financial assistance programs are to carry out their statutory responsibilities under the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101&#x2013;6106).

(b)Subparts B through D of this part set forth the uniform administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreements, including the requirements for Federal awarding agency management of Federal grant programs before the Federal award has been made, and the requirements Federal awarding agencies may impose on non-Federal entities in the Federal award.

(c)Subpart E of this part establishes principles for determining the allowable costs incurred by non-Federal entities under Federal awards. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal Government participation in the financing of a particular program or project. The principles are designed to provide that Federal awards bear their fair share of cost recognized under these principles except where restricted or prohibited by statute.

(d)Subpart F of this part is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, (31 U.S.C. 7501&#x2013;7507). It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. These provisions also provide the policies and procedures for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.

(e)For OMB guidance to Federal awarding agencies on challenges and prizes, please see memo M&#x2013;10&#x2013;11 Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government, issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.

###### § 200.101 Applicability.

(a)(1) The requirements established in this part apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. These requirements are applicable to all costs related to Federal awards.

(2) Federal awarding agencies may apply subparts A through E of this part to Federal agencies, for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations, except where the Federal awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international responsibilities of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government.

(b)(1) Throughout this part when the word “must” is used it indicates a requirement. Whereas, use of the word “should” or “may” indicates a best practice or recommended approach rather than a requirement and permits discretion.

(2) The following table describes what portions of this part apply to which types of Federal awards. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. This means that non-Federal entities must comply with requirements in this part regardless of whether the non-Federal entity is a recipient or subrecipient of a Federal award. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D of this part, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, but not any requirements in this part directed towards Federal awarding agencies unless the requirements of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award indicate otherwise.

(c)When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract, but the requirements of subparts D, E, and F are supplementary to the FAR and the contract. When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part, including subpart F of this part, which are supplementary to the CAS requirements. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR 48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603 are always unallowable. For requirements other than those covered in subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part, the terms of the contract and the FAR apply. Note that when a non-Federal entity is awarded a FAR contract, the FAR applies, and the terms and conditions of the contract shall prevail over the requirements of this part.

(d)With the exception of subpart F of this part, which is required by the Single Audit Act, in any circumstances where the provisions of Federal statutes or regulations differ from the provisions of this part, the provision of the Federal statutes or regulations govern. This includes, for agreements with Indian tribes, the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended, 25 U.S.C 450&#x2013;458ddd&#x2013;2.

(e)Except for §§ 200.203, 200.216, and 200.331 through 200.333, the requirements in subparts C, D, and E of this part do not apply to the following programs:

(1) The block grant awards authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (including Community Services), except to the extent that subpart E of this part apply to subrecipients of Community Services Block Grant funds pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9916(a)(1)(B);

(a)For Federal awards subject to this part, all administrative requirements, program manuals, handbooks and other non-regulatory materials that are inconsistent with the requirements of this part must be superseded upon implementation of this part by the Federal agency, except to the extent they are required by statute or authorized in accordance with the provisions in § 200.102.

(b)Agencies may impose legally binding requirements on recipients only through the notice and public comment process through an approved agency process, including as authorized by this part, other statutes or regulations, or as incorporated into the terms of a Federal award.

###### § 200.106 Agency implementation.

The specific requirements and responsibilities of Federal agencies and non-Federal entities are set forth in this part.

###### § 200.107 OMB responsibilities.

OMB will review Federal agency regulations and implementation of this part, and will provide interpretations of policy requirements and assistance to ensure effective and efficient implementation. Any exceptions will be subject to approval by OMB. Exceptions will only be made in particular cases where adequate justification is presented.

###### § 200.108 Inquiries.

Inquiries concerning this part may be directed to the Office of Federal Financial Management Office of Management and Budget, in Washington, DC. Non-Federal entities' inquiries should be addressed to the Federal awarding agency, cognizant agency for indirect costs, cognizant or oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity as appropriate.

###### § 200.112 Conflict of interest.

The Federal awarding agency must establish conflict of interest policies for Federal awards. The non-Federal entity must disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity in accordance with applicable Federal awarding agency policy.

###### § 200.113 Mandatory disclosures.

The non-Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Non-Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in appendix XII to this part are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings to SAM (currently FAPIIS). Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in § 200.339. (See also 2 CFR part 180, 31 U.S.C. 3321, and 41 U.S.C. 2313.)

##### Subpart C - Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards

###### § 200.200 Purpose.

Sections 200.201 through 200.216 prescribe instructions and other pre-award matters to be used by Federal awarding agencies in the program planning, announcement, application and award processes.

###### § 200.201 Use of grant agreements (including fixed amount awards), cooperative agreements, and contracts.

(a)The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate instrument for the Federal award (grant agreement, cooperative agreement, or contract) in accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&#x2013;08).

(b)In addition to the options described in paragraph (a) of this section, Federal awarding agencies, or pass-through entities as permitted in § 200.333, may use fixed amount awards (seein § 200.1) to which the following conditions apply:

(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope has measurable goals and objectives and if adequate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed amount award based on a reasonable estimate of actual cost. Payments are based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Accountability is based on performance and results. Except in the case of termination before completion of the Federal award, there is no governmental review of the actual costs incurred by the non-Federal entity in performance of the award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:

(i) In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in advance, and the “milestone” or event triggering the payment also agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the Federal award;

(ii) On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units, at a defined price or prices, agreed to in advance of performance of the Federal award and set forth in the Federal award; or,

(iii) In one payment at Federal award completion.

(2) A fixed amount award cannot be used in programs which require mandatory cost sharing or match.

(3) The non-Federal entity must certify in writing to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity at the end of the Federal award that the project or activity was completed or the level of effort was expended. If the required level of activity or effort was not carried out, the amount of the Federal award must be adjusted.

(4) Periodic reports may be established for each Federal award.

(5) Changes in principal investigator, project leader, project partner, or scope of effort must receive the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

###### § 200.202 Program planning and design.

The Federal awarding agency must design a program and create an Assistance Listing before announcing the Notice of Funding Opportunity. The program must be designed with clear goals and objectives that facilitate the delivery of meaningful results consistent with the Federal authorizing legislation of the program. Program performance shall be measured based on the goals and objectives developed during program planning and design. See § 200.301 for more information on performance measurement. Performance measures may differ depending on the type of program. The program must align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal awarding agency's performance plan and should support the Federal awarding agency's performance measurement, management, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A&#x2013;11 (Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget). The program must also be designed to align with the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (Pub. L. 114&#x2013;264).

###### § 200.203 Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs.

(a) The Federal awarding agency must notify the public of Federal programs in the Federal Assistance Listings maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA).

(1) The Federal Assistance Listings is the single, authoritative, governmentwide comprehensive source of Federal financial assistance program information produced by the executive branch of the Federal Government.

(2) The information that the Federal awarding agency must submit to GSA for approval by OMB is listed in paragraph (b) of this section. GSA must prescribe the format for the submission in coordination with OMB.

(3) The Federal awarding agency may not award Federal financial assistance without assigning it to a program that has been included in the Federal Assistance Listings as required in this section unless there are exigent circumstances requiring otherwise, such as timing requirements imposed by statute.

(b) For each program that awards discretionary Federal awards, non-discretionary Federal awards, loans, insurance, or any other type of Federal financial assistance, the Federal awarding agency must, to the extent practicable, create, update, and manage Assistance Listings entries based on the authorizing statute for the program and comply with additional guidance provided by GSA in consultation with OMB to ensure consistent, accurate information is available to prospective applicants. Accordingly, Federal awarding agencies must submit the following information to GSA:

(1)A brief summary of the statutory or regulatory requirements of the program and its intended outcome. Where appropriate, the Program Description, Purpose, Goals, and Measurement should align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal awarding agency's performance plan and should support the Federal awarding agency's performance measurement, management, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A&#x2013;11;

(2)Identification of whether the program makes Federal awards on a discretionary basis or the Federal awards are prescribed by Federal statute, such as in the case of formula grants.

(3)Estimates based on previous year funding are acceptable if current appropriations are not available at the time of the submission;

(4)The statutory authority for funding the program and, to the extent possible, agency, sub-agency, or, if known, the specific program unit that will issue the Federal awards, and associated funding identifier (Treasury Account Symbol(s));

(5)The statutory, regulatory or other eligibility factors or considerations that determine the applicant's qualification for Federal awards under the program (type of non-Federal entity); and

(6)Applicability of Single Audit Requirements as required by subpart F of this part.

###### § 200.204 Notices of funding opportunities.

For discretionary grants and cooperative agreements that are competed, the Federal awarding agency must announce specific funding opportunities by providing the following information in a public notice:

(a)The Federal awarding agency must display the following information posted on the OMB-designated governmentwide website for funding and applying for Federal financial assistance, in a location preceding the full text of the announcement:

(1) Federal Awarding Agency Name;

(2) Funding Opportunity Title;

(3) Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement of this funding opportunity or a modification of a previously announced opportunity);

(4) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if applicable). If the Federal awarding agency has assigned or will assign a number to the funding opportunity announcement, this number must be provided;

(5) Assistance Listings Number(s);

(6) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for applications or Executive Order 12372 submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or pre-applications. For any announcement issued before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the relevant Federal awarding agency.

(b)The Federal awarding agency must generally make all funding opportunities available for application for at least 60 calendar days. The Federal awarding agency may make a determination to have a less than 60 calendar day availability period but no funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless exigent circumstances require as determined by the Federal awarding agency head or delegate.

(c)The Federal awarding agency must include the following information in the full text of each funding opportunity. For specific instructions on the content required in this section, refer to appendix I to this part.

###### § 200.205 Federal awarding agency review of merit of proposals.

For discretionary Federal awards, unless prohibited by Federal statute, the Federal awarding agency must design and execute a merit review process for applications, with the objective of selecting recipients most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives outlined in section § 200.202. A merit review is an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with written standards set forth by the Federal awarding agency. This process must be described or incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity (see appendix I to this part.). See also § 200.204. The Federal awarding agency must also periodically review its merit review process.

###### § 200.206 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.

(a)(1) Prior to making a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency is required by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, 31 U.S.C. 3301 note, and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of governmentwide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR part 180 as well as individual Federal agency suspension and debarment regulations in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(2) In accordance 41 U.S.C. 2313, the Federal awarding agency is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. As required by Public Law 112&#x2013;239, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, prior to making a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency must consider all of the information available through FAPIIS with regard to the applicant and any immediate highest level owner, predecessor (a non-Federal entity that is replaced by a successor), or subsidiary, identified for that applicant in FAPIIS, if applicable. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. The Federal awarding agency may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with § 200.208.

(b)(1) The Federal awarding agency must have in place a framework for evaluating the risks posed by applicants before they receive Federal awards. This evaluation may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If the Federal awarding agency determines that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. Criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of funding opportunity described in § 200.204.

(2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal awarding agency may use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:

(i)Financial stability;

(ii)Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;

(iii)The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards;

(iv)Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F of this part or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and

(v)The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities.

(c)The Federal awarding agency may adjust requirements when a risk-evaluation indicates that it may be merited either pre-award or post-award.

(d)(1) The Federal awarding agency must comply with the guidelines on governmentwide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and must require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities.

###### § 200.207 Standard application requirements.

(a)The Federal awarding agency may only use application information collections approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 and in alignment with OMB-approved, governmentwide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead. Consistent with these requirements, OMB will authorize additional information collections only on a limited basis.

(b)If applicable, the Federal awarding agency may inform applicants and recipients that they do not need to provide certain information otherwise required by the relevant information collection.

###### § 200.208 Specific conditions.

(a) Federal awarding agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award conditions are consistent with the program design reflected in § 200.202 and include clear performance expectations of recipients as required in § 200.301.

(b) The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific Federal award conditions as needed, in accordance with this section, based on an analysis of the following factors:

(1) Based on the criteria set forth in § 200.206;

(2) The applicant or recipient's history of compliance with the general or specific terms and conditions of a Federal award;

(3) The applicant or recipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as described in § 200.211; or

(4) A responsibility determination of an applicant or recipient.

(c) Additional Federal award conditions may include items such as the following:

(1) Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments;

(2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance within a given performance period;

(3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;

(4) Requiring additional project monitoring;

(5) Requiring the non-Federal entity to obtain technical or management assistance; or

(6) Establishing additional prior approvals.

(d) If the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity is imposing additional requirements, they must notify the applicant or non-Federal entity as to:

(1) The nature of the additional requirements;

(2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;

(3) The nature of the action needed to remove the additional requirement, if applicable;

(4) The time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and

(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.

(e) Any additional requirements must be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been satisfied.

###### § 200.209 Certifications and representations.

Unless prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes or regulations, each Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity is authorized to require the non-Federal entity to submit certifications and representations required by Federal statutes, or regulations on an annual basis. Submission may be required more frequently if the non-Federal entity fails to meet a requirement of a Federal award.

###### § 200.210 Pre-award costs.

For requirements on costs incurred by the applicant prior to the start date of the period of performance of the Federal award, see § 200.458.

###### § 200.211 Information contained in a Federal award.

A Federal award must include the following information:

(a)Performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline data must be included in the Federal award, where applicable.

(v)Federal awarding agencies must make recipients aware, in a clear and unambiguous manner, of the termination provisions in § 200.340, including the applicable termination provisions in the Federal awarding agency's regulations or in each Federal award.

(2) The Federal award must incorporate, by reference, all general terms and conditions of the award, which must be maintained on the agency's website.

(3) If a non-Federal entity requests a copy of the full text of the general terms and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must provide it.

(4) Wherever the general terms and conditions are publicly available, the Federal awarding agency must maintain an archive of previous versions of the general terms and conditions, with effective dates, for use by the non-Federal entity, auditors, or others.

(d)The Federal awarding agency must include with each Federal award any terms and conditions necessary to communicate requirements that are in addition to the requirements outlined in the Federal awarding agency's general terms and conditions. See also § 200.208. Whenever practicable, these specific terms and conditions also should be shared on the agency's website and in notices of funding opportunities (as outlined in § 200.204) in addition to being included in a Federal award. See also § 200.207.

(e)Any other information required by the Federal awarding agency.

###### § 200.212 Public access to Federal award information.

(a) In accordance with statutory requirements for Federal spending transparency (FFATA), except as noted in this section, for applicable Federal awards the Federal awarding agency must announce all Federal awards publicly and publish the required information on a publicly available OMB-designated governmentwide website.

(b) All information posted in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) on or after April 15, 2011 will be publicly available after a waiting period of 14 calendar days, except for:

(1) Past performance reviews required by Federal Government contractors in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR part 42, subpart 42.15;

(2) Information that was entered prior to April 15, 2011; or

(3) Information that is withdrawn during the 14-calendar day waiting period by the Federal Government official.

(c) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring the publication of information otherwise exempt under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552), or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556.

###### § 200.213 Reporting a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award.

(a) If a Federal awarding agency does not make a Federal award to a non-Federal entity because the official determines that the non-Federal entity does not meet either or both of the minimum qualification standards as described in § 200.206(a)(2), the Federal awarding agency must report that determination to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS), only if all of the following apply:

(1) The only basis for the determination described in this paragraph (a) is the non-Federal entity's prior record of executing programs or activities under Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in § 200.206(a)(2) (the entity was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards); and

(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award that otherwise would be made to the non-Federal entity is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.

(b) The Federal awarding agency is not required to report a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award if they make the Federal award to the non-Federal entity and include specific award terms and conditions, as described in § 200.208.

(c) If a Federal awarding agency reports a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal awarding agency also must notify the non-Federal entity that&#x2014;

(1) The determination was made and reported to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM, and include with the notification an explanation of the basis for the determination;

(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination, as required by section 872 of Public Law 110&#x2013;417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313), then archived;

(3) Each Federal awarding agency that considers making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award when the total Federal share of the Federal award is expected to include an amount of Federal funding in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;

(4) The non-Federal entity may go to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)) and comment on any information the system contains about the non-Federal entity itself; and

(5) Federal awarding agencies will consider that non-Federal entity's comments in determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.

(d) If a Federal awarding agency enters information into the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM about a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently:

(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in the system within three business days; and

(2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the Federal awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.

(e) Federal awarding agencies must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency that posted the information that some or all of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal awarding agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal awarding agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.

###### § 200.214 Suspension and debarment.

Non-Federal entities are subject to the non-procurement debarment and suspension regulations implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, 2 CFR part 180. The regulations in 2 CFR part 180 restrict awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

###### § 200.215 Never contract with the enemy.

Federal awarding agencies and recipients are subject to the regulations implementing Never Contract with the Enemy in 2 CFR part 183. The regulations in 2 CFR part 183 affect covered contracts, grants and cooperative agreements that are expected to exceed $50,000 within the period of performance, are performed outside the United States and its territories, and are in support of a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities.

###### § 200.216 Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment.

(a) Recipients and subrecipients are prohibited from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to:

(1) Procure or obtain;

(2) Extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain; or

(3) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain equipment, services, or systems that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system. As described in Public Law 115&#x2013;232, section 889, covered telecommunications equipment is telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).

(i) For the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).

(ii) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or using such equipment.

(iii) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country.

(b) In implementing the prohibition under Public Law 115&#x2013;232, section 889, subsection (f), paragraph (1), heads of executive agencies administering loan, grant, or subsidy programs shall prioritize available funding and technical support to assist affected businesses, institutions and organizations as is reasonably necessary for those affected entities to transition from covered communications equipment and services, to procure replacement equipment and services, and to ensure that communications service to users and customers is sustained.

(c) See Public Law 115&#x2013;232, section 889 for additional information.

(d) See also § 200.471.

##### Subpart D - Post Federal Award Requirements

###### § 200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements.

(a) The Federal awarding agency must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, and public policy requirements: Including, but not limited to, those protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, and prohibiting discrimination. The Federal awarding agency must communicate to the non-Federal entity all relevant public policy requirements, including those in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them either directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(b) The non-Federal entity is responsible for complying with all requirements of the Federal award. For all Federal awards, this includes the provisions of FFATA, which includes requirements on executive compensation, and also requirements implementing the Act for the non-Federal entity at 2 CFR parts 25 and 170. See also statutory requirements for whistleblower protections at 10 U.S.C. 2409, 41 U.S.C. 4712, and 10 U.S.C. 2324, 41 U.S.C. 4304 and 4310.

###### § 200.301 Performance measurement.

(a) The Federal awarding agency must measure the recipient's performance to show achievement of program goals and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster adoption of promising practices. Program goals and objectives should be derived from program planning and design. See § 200.202 for more information. Where appropriate, the Federal award may include specific program goals, indicators, targets, baseline data, data collection, or expected outcomes (such as outputs, or services performance or public impacts of any of these) with an expected timeline for accomplishment. Where applicable, this should also include any performance measures or independent sources of data that may be used to measure progress. The Federal awarding agency will determine how performance progress is measured, which may differ by program. Performance measurement progress must be both measured and reported. See § 200.329 for more information on monitoring program performance. The Federal awarding agency may include program-specific requirements, as applicable. These requirements must be aligned, to the extent permitted by law, with the Federal awarding agency strategic goals, strategic objectives or performance goals that are relevant to the program. See also OMB Circular A&#x2013;11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget Part 6.

(b) The Federal awarding agency should provide recipients with clear performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline data as described in § 200.211. Performance reporting frequency and content should be established to not only allow the Federal awarding agency to understand the recipient progress but also to facilitate identification of promising practices among recipients and build the evidence upon which the Federal awarding agency's program and performance decisions are made. See § 200.328 for more information on reporting program performance.

(c) This provision is designed to operate in tandem with evidence-related statutes (The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, which emphasizes collaboration and coordination to advance data and evidence-building functions in the Federal government). The Federal awarding agency should also specify any requirements of award recipients' participation in a federally funded evaluation, and any evaluation activities required to be conducted by the Federal award.

###### § 200.302 Financial management.

(a) Each state must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the state's own funds. In addition, the state's and the other non-Federal entity's financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.450.

(b) The financial management system of each non-Federal entity must provide for the following (see also §§ 200.334, 200.335, 200.336, and 200.337):

(1) Identification, in its accounts, of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass-through entity, if any.

(2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in §§ 200.328 and 200.329. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient may develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. Similarly, a pass-through entity must not require a subrecipient to establish an accrual accounting system and must allow the subrecipient to develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(3) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-funded activities. These records must contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, financial obligations, unobligated balances, assets, expenditures, income and interest and be supported by source documentation.

(4) Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. The non-Federal entity must adequately safeguard all assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized purposes. See § 200.303.

(5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award.

(6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of § 200.305.

(7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E of this part and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

###### § 200.303 Internal controls.

The non-Federal entity must:

(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated Framework”, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

(b) Comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.

(c) Evaluate and monitor the non-Federal entity's compliance with statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified including noncompliance identified in audit findings.

(e) Take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and other information the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or the non-Federal entity considers sensitive consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and responsibility over confidentiality.

###### § 200.304 Bonds.

The Federal awarding agency may include a provision on bonding, insurance, or both in the following circumstances:

(a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the non-Federal entity are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

(b) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

(c) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223.

###### § 200.305 Federal payment.

(a) For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 4A&#x2013;2000, “Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies”.

(b) For non-Federal entities other than states, payments methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury or the pass-through entity and the disbursement by the non-Federal entity whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, or issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means. See also § 200.302(b)(6). Except as noted elsewhere in this part, Federal agencies must require recipients to use only OMB-approved, governmentwide information collection requests to request payment.

(1) The non-Federal entity must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the non-Federal entity, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a non-Federal entity must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the non-Federal entity in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the non-Federal entity for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The non-Federal entity must make timely payment to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.

(2) Whenever possible, advance payments must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.

(i) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer and must comply with applicable guidance in 31 CFR part 208.

(ii) Non-Federal entities must be authorized to submit requests for advance payments and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used, and as often as they like when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693&#x2013;1693r).

(3) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in this paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the Federal awarding agency sets a specific condition per § 200.208, or when the non-Federal entity requests payment by reimbursement. This method may be used on any Federal award for construction, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.

(4) If the non-Federal entity cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the non-Federal entity to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the non-Federal entity's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance method of payment requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients in order to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment must not be used by the pass-through entity if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(5) To the extent available, the non-Federal entity must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(6) Unless otherwise required by Federal statutes, payments for allowable costs by non-Federal entities must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless the conditions of § 200.208, subpart D of this part, including § 200.339, or one or more of the following applies:

(i) The non-Federal entity has failed to comply with the project objectives, Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(ii) The non-Federal entity is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&#x2013;129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.” Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may, upon reasonable notice, inform the non-Federal entity that payments must not be made for financial obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

(iii) A payment withheld for failure to comply with Federal award conditions, but without suspension of the Federal award, must be released to the non-Federal entity upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 200.343.

(iv) A payment must not be made to a non-Federal entity for amounts that are withheld by the non-Federal entity from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. A payment must be made when the non-Federal entity actually disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.

(7) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of advance payments under Federal awards are as follows.

(i) The Federal awarding agency and pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a non-Federal entity or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to the non-Federal entity. However, the non-Federal entity must be able to account for funds received, obligated, and expended.

(ii) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

(8) The non-Federal entity must maintain advance payments of Federal awards in interest-bearing accounts, unless the following apply:

(i) The non-Federal entity receives less than $250,000 in Federal awards per year.

(ii) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances.

(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts.

(9) Interest earned amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal entity for administrative expense. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

(i) For returning interest on Federal awards paid through PMS, the refund should:

(A) Provide an explanation stating that the refund is for interest;

(B) List the PMS Payee Account Number(s) (PANs);

(C) List the Federal award number(s) for which the interest was earned; and

(D) Make returns payable to: Department of Health and Human Services.

(ii) For returning interest on Federal awards not paid through PMS, the refund should:

(A) Provide an explanation stating that the refund is for interest;

(B) Include the name of the awarding agency;

(C) List the Federal award number(s) for which the interest was earned; and

(D) Make returns payable to: Department of Health and Human Services.

(10) Funds, principal, and excess cash returns must be directed to the original Federal agency payment system. The non-Federal entity should review instructions from the original Federal agency payment system. Returns should include the following information:

(i) Payee Account Number (PAN), if the payment originated from PMS, or Agency information to indicate whom to credit the funding if the payment originated from ASAP, NSF, or another Federal agency payment system.

(ii) PMS document number and subaccount(s), if the payment originated from PMS, or relevant account numbers if the payment originated from another Federal agency payment system.

(iii) The reason for the return (excess cash, funds not spent, interest, part interest part other, etc.)

(11) When returning funds or interest to PMS you must include the following as applicable:

(i) For ACH Returns:

(ii) For Fedwire Returns:

Please note that the organization initiating payment is likely to incur a charge from their Financial Institution for this type of payment.

(iii) For International ACH Returns:

(iv) For recipients that do not have electronic remittance capability, please make checkpayable to: “The Department of Health and Human Services.”

Please allow 4&#x2013;6 weeks for processing of a payment by check to be applied to the appropriate PMS account.

(v) Questions can be directed to PMS at 877&#x2013;614&#x2013;5533 or

###### § 200.306 Cost sharing or matching.

(a) Under Federal research proposals, voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected. It cannot be used as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals, but may be considered if it is both in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations and specified in a notice of funding opportunity. Criteria for considering voluntary committed cost sharing and any other program policy factors that may be used to determine who may receive a Federal award must be explicitly described in the notice of funding opportunity. See also §§ 200.414 and 200.204 and appendix I to this part.

(b) For all Federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the non-Federal entity's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria:

(1) Are verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records;

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;

(3) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives;

(4) Are allowable under subpart E of this part;

(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;

(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency; and

(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.

(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the non-Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

(d) Values for non-Federal entity contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E of this part. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes the non-Federal entity to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching must be the lesser of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the non-Federal entity's accounting records at the time of donation.

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section at the time of donation.

(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the non-Federal entity. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the non-Federal entity, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the non-Federal entity competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable may be included in the valuation.

(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 200.414(d) provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.

(g) Donated property from third parties may include such items as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated property included in the cost sharing or matching share must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

(h) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for third-party-donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the non-Federal entity may differ according to the purpose of the Federal award, if paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section applies.

(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the non-Federal entity in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges. See also § 200.420.

(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the non-Federal entity, with the following qualifications:

(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the non-Federal entity as established by an independent appraiser (certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the non-Federal entity as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601&#x2013;4655) (Uniform Act) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs”.

(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.

(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.

(j) For third-party in-kind contributions, the fair market value of goods and services must be documented and to the extent feasible supported by the same methods used internally by the non-Federal entity.

(k) For IHEs, see also OMB memorandum M&#x2013;01&#x2013;06, dated January 5, 2001, Clarification of OMB A&#x2013;21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.

###### § 200.307 Program income.

(a)Non-Federal entities are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.

(b)If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.

(c)Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Federal award or Federal awarding agency regulations as program income.

(d)Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies are not program income; such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards §§ 200.311, 200.313, and 200.314, or as specifically identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(e)If the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, or give prior approval for how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(1) of this section must apply. For Federal awards made to IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, if the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(2) of this section must apply. In specifying alternatives to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, the Federal awarding agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When the Federal awarding agency authorizes the approaches in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any amounts specified must also be deducted from expenditures.

(1)Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income must be used for current costs unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.

(2)With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency (except for IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, as described in this paragraph (e)) program income may be added to the Federal award by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. The program income must be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the Federal award.

(3)With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the Federal award. The amount of the Federal award remains the same.

(f)There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of income earned after the end of the period of performance for the Federal award, unless the Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award provide otherwise. The Federal awarding agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the period of performance as part of the grant closeout process. See also § 200.344.

(g)Unless the Federal statute, regulations, or terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, the non-Federal entity is not accountable to the Federal awarding agency with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award to which 37 CFR part 401 is applicable.

###### § 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans.

(a) The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share (see definition forin § 200.1) or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. The budget and program plans include considerations for performance and program evaluation purposes whenever required in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget or project scope or objective, and request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

(c) For non-construction Federal awards, recipients must request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for the following program or budget-related reasons:

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or the Federal award.

(3) The disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E of this part as applicable.

(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other categories of expense.

(6) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal awards, the subawarding, transferring or contracting out of any work under a Federal award, including fixed amount subawards as described in § 200.333. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.

(7) Changes in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-Federal entity.

(8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB. See also §§ 200.102 and 200.407.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section, the Federal awarding agency is authorized, at its option, to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approvals contained in subparts D and E of this part. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:

(1) Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award. Expenses more than 90 calendar days pre-award require prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All costs incurred before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award are at the recipient's risk (the Federal awarding agency is not required to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive a Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). See also § 200.458.

(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the end of the period of performance specified in the Federal award. This one-time extension must not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. Extensions require explicit prior Federal awarding agency approval when:

(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension.

(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.

(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods.

(4) For Federal awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the Federal award or in the Federal awarding agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in this paragraph (e) are automatically waived (recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies.

(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for Federal awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency cannot permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation.

(g) All other changes to non-construction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (c) of this section, do not require prior approval (see also § 200.407).

(h) For construction Federal awards, the recipient must request prior written approval promptly from the Federal awarding agency for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies:

(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.

(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in subpart E.

(4) No other prior approval requirements for budget revisions may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB.

(5) When a Federal awarding agency makes a Federal award that provides support for construction and non-construction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to obtain prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

(i) When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in the application, unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.

(j) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Federal awarding agency must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

###### § 200.309 Modifications to Period of Performance.

If a Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity approves an extension, or if a recipient extends under § 200.308(e)(2), the Period of Performance will be amended to end at the completion of the extension. If a termination occurs, the Period of Performance will be amended to end upon the effective date of termination. If a renewal award is issued, a distinct Period of Performance will begin.

###### § 376.137 Who in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

The HHS Debarring/Suspension Official has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction as provided at 2 CFR 180.135.

###### § 376.147 Does an exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs under Title XI of the Social Security Act affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement and procurement transactions?

Any individual or entity excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs under Title XI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a&#x2013;7, 1320a&#x2013;7a, 1320c&#x2013;5, or 1395ccc, and implementing regulation at 42 CFR part 1001, will be subject to the prohibitions against participating in covered transactions, as set forth in this part and part 180, and is prohibited from participating in all Federal Government procurement programs and nonprocurement programs. For example, if an individual or entity is excluded by the HHS Office of the Inspector General from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and/or other Federal health care programs, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1320a&#x2013;7, then that individual or entity is prohibited from participating in all Federal Government procurement and nonprocurement programs (42 CFR part 1001).

### Chapter IV - Department of Agriculture

#### PART 400 - UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS

##### § 400.1 What does this part do?

This part adopts the OMB guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this part, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the USDA to the OMB guidance, as supplemented by this part.

##### § 400.2 Conflict of interest.

(a) Each USDA awarding agency must establish conflict of interest policies for its Federal awards.

(b) Non-Federal entities must disclose in writing any potential conflicts of interest to the USDA awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(1) The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of its employees in the selection, award and administration of Federal awards. No employee, officer or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a non-Federal entity considered for a Federal award. The non-Federal entity may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the non-Federal entity.

(2) If the non-Federal entity has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of the relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a Federal award action involving a related organization.

#### PART 415 - GENERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

##### Subpart A - Application for Federal Assistance

###### § 415.1 Competition in the awarding of discretionary grants and cooperative agreements.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, awarding agencies shall enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. An awarding agency's competitive award process shall adhere to the following standards:

(1) Potential applicants must be invited to submit proposals through publications such as theOMB-designated governmentwide website as described in 2 CFR 200.204, professional trade journals, agency or program handbooks, the Assistance Listings, or any other appropriate means of solicitation. In so doing, awarding agencies should consider the broadest dissemination of project solicitations in order to reach the highest number of potential applicants.

(2) Proposals are to be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with written criteria set forth by the awarding agency. Reviewers should make written comments, as appropriate, on each application. Independent reviewers may be from the private sector, another agency, or within the awarding agency, as long as they do not include anyone who has approval authority for the applications being reviewed or anyone who might appear to have a conflict of interest in the role of reviewer of applications. A conflict of interest might arise when the reviewer or the reviewer's immediate family members have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial interest in the applicant or applicant organization; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment.

(3) An unsolicited application, which is not unique and innovative, shall be competed under the project solicitation it comes closest to fitting. Awarding agency officials will determine the solicitation under which the application is to be evaluated. When the awarding agency official decides that the unsolicited application does not fall under a recent, current, or planned solicitation, a noncompetitive award may be made, if appropriate to do so under the criteria of this section. Otherwise, the application should be returned to the applicant.

(b)A project solicitation by the awarding agency shall include or reference the following, as appropriate:

(1) A description of the eligible activities which the awarding agency proposes to support and the program priorities;

(2) Eligible applicants;

(3) The dates and amounts of funds expected to be available for awards;

(4) Evaluation criteria and weights, if appropriate, assigned to each;

(5) Methods for evaluating and ranking applications;

(6) Name and address where proposals should be mailed or emailed and submission deadline(s);

(7) Any required forms and how to obtain them;

(8) Applicable cost principles and administrative requirements;

(9) Type of funding instrument intended to be used (grant or cooperative agreement); and

(10) The Assistance Listings number and title.

(c)The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding/approving official in each agency. The awarding/approving official shall consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the independent review group, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the award decision shall be handled by the awarding agency using existing agency appeal procedures or good administrative practice and sound business judgment.

(d)The awarding/approving official may make a determination in writing that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination shall be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of the program. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

(1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services;

(2) Awards of less than $75,000;

(3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award;

(4) Awards which cannot be delayed due to an emergency or a substantial danger to health or safety;

(5) Awards when it is impracticable to secure competition; or

(6) Awards to fund unique and innovative unsolicited applications.

(b) Procurements by States under USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) shall be conducted in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographic preferences except as provided for in 2 CFR 200.319(c).

#### PART 417 - NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 417.137 Who in the USDA may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 417.210 Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 417.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 417.215.

###### § 417.215 Which nonprocurement transactions, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.215, are not covered transactions?

(a)In addition to the nonprocurement transactions listed in 2 CFR 180.215, the following nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

(1) An entitlement or mandatory award required by a statute, including a lower tier entitlement or mandatory award that is required by a statute.

(2) The export or substitution of Federal timber governed by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620(The “Export Act”), which prevents a debarred person from entering into any contract for the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands.16 U.S.C. 620d(d)(1)(A).

(3) The receipt of licenses, permits, certificates, and indemnification under regulatory programs conducted in the interest of public health and safety, and animal and plant health and safety.

(b)Notwithstanding the fact that transactions to be implemented outside the United States that are below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program, export credit guarantee program or direct credit program are not covered transactions, pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8) and (9) of this section, primary tier participants under these programs must check the EPLS prior to entering into any transaction with a person at the first lower tier and shall not enter into such a transaction if the person is excluded or disqualified under the EPLS.

(c)A cause for suspension or debarment under § 180.700 or § 180.800 of this title (as supplemented by § 417.800) may be based on the actions of a person with respect to a procurement or nonprocurement transaction under a USDA program even if such transaction has been excluded from covered transaction status by this section or § 417.220.

###### § 417.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part:

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (appendix to this part).

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 417.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of a USDA official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

(c) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA export credit guarantee program or direct credit program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(e) Notwithstanding the fact that procurement contracts to be implemented outside the United States that are below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program, export credit guarantee program or direct credit program are not covered transactions, pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, primary tier participants under these programs must check the EPLS prior to entering into any procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with a person at the first lower tier and shall not enter into such a procurement contract if the person is excluded or disqualified under the EPLS.

###### § 417.221 How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's foreign assistance programs apply?

The primary tier covered transaction would be the food aid grant agreement entered into between USDA and a program participant, such as a U.S. private voluntary organization. USDA would have to check the EPLS before entering into the food aid grant agreement to ensure that the U.S. private voluntary organization that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a subrecipient agreement between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign subrecipient of the commodities that were provided under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(8), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract entered into between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign entity to provide supplies or services that are expected to equal or exceed $25,000 in value and that are needed by such organization to implement activities under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. private voluntary organization would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with a subrecipient or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

###### § 417.222 How would the exclusions from coverage for USDA's export credit guarantee and direct credit programs apply?

(a)In the case of the export credit guarantee program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the guarantee issued by the USDA to a U.S. exporter. The U.S. exporter usually assigns the guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, and this would create another primary tier covered transaction between USDA and the U.S. financial institution. USDA would have to check the EPLS before issuing a guarantee or accepting a guarantee assignment to ensure that the U.S. exporter or financial institution that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank to the U.S. exporter to pay on behalf of the importer for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the guarantee. Similarly, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank under an instrument, such as a loan agreement or letter of credit, to the U.S. financial institution assigned the guarantee, which has paid the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities and, in so doing, issued a loan to the foreign bank, which the foreign bank is obligated to repay on deferred payment terms. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), these nonprocurement transactions would not be covered transactions. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a procurement contract (a contract for the purchase and sale of goods) that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the guarantee. Pursuant to § 417.220(d), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. exporter or U.S. financial institution would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or foreign bank or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

(b)In the case of the direct credit program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the financing agreement between the USDA and the U.S. exporter. USDA purchases the exporter's account receivable in a particular transaction pursuant to the financing agreement. On occasion, such transaction may contemplate a payment obligation of a U.S. or foreign bank to make the required payments. USDA would have to check the EPLS before entering into a financing agreement or accepting such a payor to ensure that the U.S. exporter or the bank, if any, that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of the importer to pay the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(d), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. exporter would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or bank, or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

###### § 417.332 What methods must I use to pass down requirements to participants in lower tier covered transactions with whom I intend to do business?

You as a participant must include a term or condition in lower tier covered transactions requiring lower tier participants to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part.

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of Department of Agriculture Officials Regarding Transactions

###### § 417.437 What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower tier covered transactions.

##### Subpart E - System for Award Management Exclusions

###### § 417.500 What is the purpose of the System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions)?

SAM Exclusions is a widely available source of the most current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.

###### § 417.505 Who uses SAM Exclusions?

(a) Federal agency officials use SAM Exclusions to determine whether to enter into a transaction with a person, as required under § 180.430 of this title.

(b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use SAM Exclusions to determine if&#x2014;

(1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, as required under § 180.320 of this title; or

(2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.

(c) SAM Exclusions are available to the general public.

###### § 417.510 Who maintains SAM Exclusions?

The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains SAM Exclusions. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into SAM Exclusions.

###### § 417.515 What specific information is in SAM Exclusions?

(a) At a minimum, SAM Exclusions indicates&#x2014;

(1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded and disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if more than one name is involved in a single action;

(2) The type of action;

(3) The cause for the action;

(4) The scope of the action;

(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95&#x2013;507 and other subsequent amendments.

(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 418.205 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 418.210 Reporting.

No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

##### Subpart C - Activities by Other Than Own Employees

###### § 418.300 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) The reporting requirements in § 418.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

##### Subpart D - Penalties and Enforcement

###### § 418.400 Penalties.

An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

###### § 418.405 Penalty procedures.

Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C.s 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

###### § 418.410 Enforcement.

(5) Monitoring the progress of all research misconduct cases; and

(6) Serving as liaison with OIG to receive allegations of research misconduct when they are received via the OIG Hotline.

##### § 422.2 Procedures.

Research institutions that conduct extramural research funded by USDA must foster an atmosphere conducive to research integrity. They must develop or have procedures in place to respond to allegations of research misconduct that ensure:

(a) Appropriate separations of responsibility for inquiry, investigation, and adjudication;

(b) Objectivity;

(c) Due process;

(d) Whistleblower protection;

(e) Confidentiality. To the extent possible and consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subjects and informants is limited to those who need to know; and

(f) Timely resolution.

##### § 422.3 Inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

A research institution that conducts extramural research funded by USDA bears primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct allegations reported directly to it. The research institution must perform an inquiry in response to an allegation, and must follow the inquiry with an investigation if the inquiry determines that the allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance. The responsibilities for adjudication must be separate from those for inquiry and investigation. In most instances, USDA will rely on a research institution conducting extramural research to promptly:

(a) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged research misconduct;

(b) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted;

(c) Acquire, prepare, and maintain appropriate records of allegations of extramural research misconduct and all related inquiries, investigations, and findings; and

(d) Take action to ensure the following:

(1) The integrity of research;

(2) The rights and interests of the subject of the investigation and the public are protected;

(3) The observance of legal requirements or responsibilities including cooperation with criminal investigations; and

(4) Appropriate safeguards for subjects of allegations, as well as informants (see § 422.6). These safeguards should include timely written notification of subjects regarding substantive allegations made against them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access to the data and other evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to respond to allegations, the supporting evidence and the proposed findings of research misconduct, if any.

##### § 422.4 USDA Panel to determine appropriateness of research misconduct policy.

Before USDA will rely on a research institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of an allegation in accordance with this part, the research institution where the research misconduct is alleged must provide the ARIO its policies and procedures related to research misconduct at the institution. The research institution has the option of providing either a written copy of such policies and procedures or a Web site address where such policies and procedures can be accessed. The ARIO to whom the policies and procedures were made available shall convene a panel comprised of the USDA RIO and ARIOs from the Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Panel will review the research institution's policies and procedures for compliance with the OSTP Policy and render a decision regarding the research institution's ability to adequately resolve research misconduct allegations. The ARIO will inform the research institution of the Panel's determination that its inquiry, investigation, and adjudication procedures are sufficient. If the Panel determines that the research institution does not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to conduct inquiry, investigation, and adjudication proceedings, or that the research institution is in any way unfit or unprepared to handle the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication in a prompt, unbiased, fair, and independent manner, the ARIO will inform the research institution in writing of the Panel's decision. An appropriate USDA agency, as determined by the Panel, will then conduct the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct in accordance with this part. If an allegation of research misconduct is made regarding extramural research conducted at a Federal research institution (whether USDA or not), it is presumed that the Federal research institution has research misconduct procedures consistent with the OSTP Policy. USDA reserves the right to convene the Panel to assess the sufficiency of a Federal agency's research misconduct procedures, should there be any question whether the agency's procedures will ensure a fair, unbiased, equitable, and independent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication process.

##### § 422.5 Reservation of right to conduct subsequent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

(a) USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation. This may be necessary if the USDA RIO or ARIO believes, in his or her sound discretion, that despite the Panel's finding that the research institution in question had appropriate and OSTP-compliant research misconduct procedures in place, the research institution conducting the extramural research at issue:

(1) Did not adhere to its own research misconduct procedures;

(2) Did not conduct research misconduct proceedings in a fair, unbiased, or independent manner; or

(3) Has not completed research misconduct inquiry, investigation, or adjudication in a timely manner.

(b) Additionally, USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation for any other reason that the USDA RIO or ARIO considers it appropriate to conduct research misconduct proceedings in lieu of the research institution's conducting the extramural research at issue. This right is subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) In cases where the USDA RIO or ARIO believes it is necessary for USDA to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation, the USDA RIO or ARIO shall reconvene the Panel, which will determine whether it is appropriate for the relevant USDA agency to conduct the research misconduct proceedings related to the allegation(s) of research misconduct. If the Panel determines that it is appropriate for a USDA agency to conduct the proceedings, the ARIO will immediately notify the research institution in question. The research institution must then promptly provide the relevant USDA agency with documentation of the research misconduct proceedings the research institution has conducted to that point, and the USDA agency will conduct research misconduct proceedings in accordance with the Agency research misconduct procedures.

##### § 422.6 Notification of USDA of allegations of research misconduct.

(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify OIG and the USDA RIO of all allegations of research misconduct involving USDA funds when the institution inquiry into the allegation warrants the institution moving on to an investigation.

(b) Individuals at research institutions who suspect research misconduct at the institution should report allegations in accordance with the institution's research misconduct policies and procedures. Anyone else who suspects that researchers or research institutions performing Federally-funded research may have engaged in research misconduct is encouraged to make a formal allegation of research misconduct to OIG.

(1) OIG may be notified using any of the following methods:

(i) Via the OIG Hotline: Telephone: (202) 690&#x2013;1622, (800) 424&#x2013;9121, (202) 690&#x2013;1202 (TDD).

(c) To the extent known, the following details should be included in any formal allegation:

(1) The name of the research projects involved, the nature of the alleged misconduct, and the names of the individual or individuals alleged to be involved in the misconduct;

(2) The source or sources of funding for the research project or research projects involved in the alleged misconduct;

(3) Important dates;

(4) Any documentation that bears upon the allegation; and

(5) Any other potentially relevant information.

(d) Safeguards for informants give individuals the confidence that they can bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of appropriate authorities or serve as informants to an inquiry or an investigation without suffering retribution. Safeguards include protection against retaliation for informants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective procedures for the examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct, and diligence in protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make allegations of research misconduct in good faith. The identity of informants who wish to remain anonymous will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law or regulation.

##### § 422.7 Notification of ARIO during an inquiry or investigation.

(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify the ARIO should the institution become aware during an inquiry or investigation that:

(1) Public health or safety is at risk;

(2) The resources, reputation, or other interests of USDA are in need of protection;

(4) Federal action may be needed to protect the interest of a subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected;

(5) A premature public disclosure of the inquiry into or investigation of the allegation may compromise the process;

(6) The scientific community or the public should be informed; or

(7) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.

(b) If research misconduct proceedings reveal behavior that may be criminal in nature at any point during the proceedings, the institution must promptly notify the ARIO.

##### § 422.8 Communication of research misconduct policies and procedures.

Institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research are to maintain and effectively communicate to their staffs policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the guidelines in this part. The institution is to inform their researchers and staff members who conduct USDA-funded extramural research when and under what circumstances USDA is to be notified of allegations of research misconduct, and when and under what circumstances USDA is to be updated on research misconduct proceedings.

##### § 422.9 Documents required.

(a) A research institution that conducts USDA-funded extramural research must maintain the following documents related to an allegation of research misconduct at the research institution:

(1) A written statement describing the original allegation;

(2) A copy of the formal notification presented to the subject of the allegation;

(3) A written report describing the inquiry stage and its outcome including copies of all supporting documentation;

(4) A description of the methods and procedures used to gather and evaluate information pertinent to the alleged misconduct during inquiry and investigation stages;

(5) A written report of the investigation, including the evidentiary record and supporting documentation;

(6) A written statement of the findings; and

(7) If applicable, a statement of recommended corrective actions, and any response to such a statement by the subject of the original allegation, and/or other interested parties, including any corrective action plan.

(b) The research institution must retain the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section for at least 3 years following the final adjudication of the alleged research misconduct.

##### § 422.10 Reporting to USDA.

Following completion of an investigation into allegations of research misconduct, the institution conducting extramural research must provide to the ARIO a copy of the evidentiary record, the report of the investigation, recommendations made to the institution's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's determination, the institution's corrective action taken or planned, and the written response of the individual who is the subject of the allegation to any recommendations.

##### § 422.11 Research records and evidence.

(a) A research institution that conducts extramural research supported by USDA funds, as the responsible legal entity for the USDA-supported research, has a continuing obligation to create and maintain adequate records (including documents and other evidentiary matter) as may be required by any subsequent inquiry, investigation, finding, adjudication, or other proceeding.

(b) Whenever an investigation is initiated, the research institution must promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all relevant research records and evidence as may be necessary to conduct the research misconduct proceedings. This must be accomplished before the research institution notifies the researcher/respondent of the allegation, or immediately thereafter.

(c) The original research records and evidence taken into custody by the research institution shall be inventoried and stored in a secure place and manner. Research records involving raw data shall include the devices or instruments on which they reside. However, if deemed appropriate by the research institution or investigator, research data or records that reside on or in instruments or devices may be copied and removed from those instruments or devices as long as the copies are complete, accurate, and have substantially equivalent evidentiary value as the data or records have when the data or records reside on the instruments or devices. Such copies of data or records shall be made by a disinterested, qualified technician and not by the subject of the original allegation or other interested parties. When the relevant data or records have been removed from the devices or instruments, the instruments or devices need not be maintained as evidence.

##### § 422.12 Remedies for noncompliance.

USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the administrative actions available to remedy a finding of research misconduct. Such actions may include the recovery of funds, correction of the research record, debarment of the researcher(s) that engaged in the research misconduct, proper attribution, or any other action deemed appropriate to remedy the instance(s) of research misconduct. The agency should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowingly conducted, intentional, or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or had significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare. In determining the appropriate administrative action, the appropriate agency must impose a remedy that is commensurate with the infraction as described in the finding of research misconduct.

##### § 422.13 Appeals.

(a) If USDA relied on an institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication, the alleged person(s) should first follow the institution's appeal policy and procedures.

(b) USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the appeal process when a finding of research misconduct is elevated to the agency.

##### § 422.14 Relationship to other requirements.

Some of the research covered by this part also may be subject to regulations of other governmental agencies (a university that receives funding from a USDA agency and also under a grant from another Federal agency). If more than one agency of the Federal Government has jurisdiction, USDA will cooperate with the other agency(ies) in designating a lead agency. When USDA is not the lead agency, it will rely on the lead agency following its policies and procedures in determining whether there is a finding of research misconduct. Further, USDA may, in consultation with the lead agency, take action to protect the health and safety of the public, to promote the integrity of the USDA-supported research and research process, or to conserve public funds. When appropriate, USDA will seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.

###### § 700.1 Definitions.

These are the definitions for terms used in this part. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities.

means a set of actions through which inputs&#x2014;such as commodities, technical assistance, training, or resource transfers&#x2014;are mobilized to produce specific outputs, such as vaccinations given, schools built, microenterprise loans issued, or policies changed. Activities are undertaken to achieve objectives that have been formally approved and notified to Congress.

means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, terminate and/or closeout assistance agreements subject to this part, and make related determinations and findings on behalf of USAID. An Agreement Officer can only act within the scope of a duly authorized warrant or other valid delegation of authority. The term “Agreement Officer” includes persons warranted as “Grant Officers.” It also includes certain authorized representatives of the Agreement Officer acting within the limits of their authority as delegated by the Agreement Officer.

means the applicant(s) for USAID funding recommended for an award after merit review, but who has not yet been awarded a grant, cooperative agreement or other assistance award by the Agreement Officer. Apparently successful applicant status confers no right and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award, which still must be executed by the Agreement Officer.

means financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants, cooperative agreements, and other agreements in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not include: Technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; contracts which are required to be entered into and administered under procurement laws and regulations.

means a strategy the apparently successful applicant submits at the specific request of an USAID Agreement Officer after merit review of an application for USAID funding, describing how the program, project, or activity is named and positioned, as well as how it is promoted and communicated to beneficiaries and cooperating country citizens. It identifies all donors and explains how they will be acknowledged. A Branding Strategy is required even if a Presumptive Exception is approved in the Marking Plan.

mean any material, article, supply, goods or equipment, excluding recipient offices, vehicles, and non-deliverable items for recipient's internal use in administration of the USAID-funded grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement or subagreement.

means the date on which all work under an award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment, on which USAID sponsorship ends.

means a plan that the apparently successful applicant submits at the specific request of a USAID Agreement Officer after merit review of an application for USAID funding, detailing the public communications, commodities, and program materials and other items that will visibly bear the USAID Identity. Recipients may request approval of Presumptive Exceptions to marking requirements in the Marking Plan.

means the most senior officer in an USAID Operating Unit in the field,USAID Mission Director or USAID Representative. For global programs managed from Washington but executed across many countries such as disaster relief and assistance to internally displaced persons, humanitarian emergencies or immediate post conflict and political crisis response, the cognizant Principal Officer may be an Office Director, for example, the Directors of USAID/W/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Office of Transition Initiatives. For non-presence countries, the cognizant Principal Officer is the Senior USAID officer in a regional USAID Operating Unit responsible for the non-presence country, or in the absence of such a responsible operating unit, the Principle U.S Diplomatic Officer in the non-presence country exercising delegated authority from USAID.

means an organized set of activities and allocation of resources directed toward a common purpose, objective, or goal undertaken or proposed by an organization to carry out the responsibilities assigned to it. Projects include all the marginal costs of inputs (including the proposed investment) technically required to produce a discrete marketable output or a desired result (for example, services from a fully functional water/sewage treatment facility).

are documents and messages intended for distribution to audiences external to the recipient's organization. They include, but are not limited to, correspondence, publications, studies, reports, audio visual productions, and other informational products; applications, forms, press and promotional materials used in connection with USAID funded programs, projects or activities, including signage and plaques; Web sites/Internet activities; and events such as training courses, conferences, seminars, press conferences and the like.

means an action by USAID that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under USAID regulations implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” See 2 CFR part 780.

means the difference between the amount awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

means the United States Agency for International Development.

(Identity) means the official marking for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) comprised of the USAID logo or seal and new brandmark with the tagline that clearly communicates our assistance is “from the American people.” In exceptional circumstances, upon a written determination by the USAID Administrator, the definition of the USAID Identity may be amended to include additional or substitute use of a logo or seal and tagline representing a presidential initiative or other high level interagency Federal initiative that requires consistent and uniform branding and marking by all participating agencies. The USAID Identity (including any required presidential initiative or related identity) is available on the USAID Web site atand is provided without royalty, license or other fee to recipients of USAID funded grants or cooperative agreements or other assistance awards.

means the principal officer of the organization's governing body (for example, chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees); the principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (for example, executive director, deputy director, president, vice president); the program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as identified in the solicitation or resulting cooperative agreement. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime recipient, must be vetted.

means those individuals identified for approval as part of substantial involvement in a cooperative agreement whose positions are essential to the successful implementation of an award.means the USAID employee identified in the application or award as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the Partner Information Form, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security (SEC), and conveying the vetting determination to each applicant, potential subrecipients and contractors subject to vetting, and the agreement officer. The vetting official is not part of the office making the award selection and has no involvement in the selection process.

##### § 701.2 Applicability.

The requirements established in this part apply to non-Federal entities, non-profit organizations, for-profit entities, and foreign organizations.

##### § 701.3 Partner vetting.

(a) It is USAID policy that USAID may determine that a particular award is subject to vetting in the interest of national security. In that case, USAID may require vetting of the key individuals of applicants, including key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the applicant, first tier subrecipients, contractors, and any other class of subawards and procurements as identified in the assistance solicitation and resulting award. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award to any applicant who determined ineligible by the vetting process.

(b) When USAID determines an award to be subject to vetting, the agreement officer determines the appropriate stage of the award cycle to require applicants to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500&#x2013;13, to the vetting official identified in the assistance solicitation. The agreement officer must specify in the assistance solicitation the stage at which the applicants will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500&#x2013;13. As a general matter those applicants who will be vetted will be typically the applicants that have been determined to be apparently successful.

(c) Selection of the successful applicant proceeds separately from vetting. The agreement officer makes the selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that, based on the vetting results, the apparently successful applicant is eligible or ineligible for an award. However, no applicants will be excluded from an award until after vetting has been completed.

(d) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the agreement officer may only award to an applicant that has been determined to be eligible after completion of the vetting process.

(e)(1) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the recipient must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:

(i) Key individuals; or

(ii) Subrecipients and contractors for which vetting is required.

(2) The recipient must submit the completed Partner Information Form within 15 days of the change in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(f) USAID may vet key individuals of the recipient, subrecipients and contractors periodically during program implementation using information already submitted on the Form.

(g) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of subawards when the prime recipient requests prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) for the subaward, transfer, or contracting out of any work.

(h) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of contractors of certain services. The agreement officer must identify these services in the assistance solicitation and any resulting award.

(i) When vetting of subawards is required, the agreement officer must not approve the subaward, transfer, or contracting out, or the procurement of certain classes of items until the organization subject to vetting has been determined eligible. When vetting of contractors is required, the recipient may not procure the identified services until the contractor has been determined to be eligible.

(j) The recipient may instruct prospective subrecipients or, when applicable contractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the recipient submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.

(k)(1) The agreement officer must insert the pre-award provision Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements in Appendix B of this part in all assistance solicitations USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

(2) The agreement officer must insert the award term Partner Vetting in Appendix B in all assistance solicitations and awards USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

VA Central Office will notify all VA field offices of sanctions imposed and still in effect under this subpart.

###### § 801.1112 Conference.

Upon receipt of a request for a conference, the official imposing the sanction shall arrange such a conference with the participant or contractor and may designate another official to conduct the conference.

This conference precedes, and is in addition to, the formal hearing provided if an appeal is taken under § 801.1113. Although formal rules of procedure do not apply to the conference, the participant or contractor may be represented by counsel and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. After consideration of the information and materials presented, the official shall, in writing, advise the participant or contractor of the decision to withdraw, modify or affirm the limited denial of participation. If the decision is made to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, the participant shall be advised of the right to request a formal hearing in writing within 30 days of receipt of the notice of decision. This decision shall be issued promptly, but in no event later than 20 days after the conference and receipt of materials.

###### § 801.1113 Appeal.

This request shall be filed within 30 days of receipt of the decision to affirm. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held in accordance with the procedures in §§ 108.825 through 108.855.

(2) Concurred in by legal counsel and the Contracting Officer; and

(3) Approved, prior to award, by an approver at least one level above the Contracting Officer.

(c)DOE may award a grant or cooperative agreement on a noncompetitive basis only if the application satisfies one or more of the follow selection criteria:

(1) The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation or renewal of, an activity presently being funded by DOE or another Federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.

(2) The activity is being or would be conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provided by third parties; however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.

(3) The applicant is a unit of government and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction, thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity.

(4) The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique equipment, proprietary data, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications.

(5) The award implements an agreement between the United States Government and a foreign government to fund a foreign applicant.

(6) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare or national security requirement preclude competition.

(7) The proposed project was submitted as an unsolicited proposal and represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned notice of funding opportunity, and if, as determined by DOE, a competitive notice of funding opportunity would not be appropriate.

(8) The responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or other official of equivalent authority has determined that making the award non-competitively is in the public interest. This authority cannot not be delegated.

(d)Determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:

(1) Documented in writing;

(a) A DOE financial assistance award is valid only if it is in writing and is signed, either in writing or electronically, by a DOE Contracting Officer.

(b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes the Recipient's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Award.

###### § 910.128 Disputes and appeals.

(a)Whenever practicable, DOE shall attempt to resolve informally any dispute over the award or administration of Federal financial assistance. Informal resolution, including resolution through an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, shall be preferred over formal procedures, to the extent practicable.

(b)Before issuing a final determination in any dispute in which informal resolution has not been achieved, the Contracting Officer shall suggest that the other party consider the use of voluntary consensual methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation. The DOE dispute resolution specialist is available to provide assistance for such disputes, as are trained mediators of other federal agencies. ADR may be used at any stage of a dispute.

(c)Whenever a dispute is not resolved informally or through an alternative dispute resolution process, DOE shall mail (by certified mail) a brief written determination signed by a Contracting Officer, setting forth DOE's final disposition of such dispute. Such determination shall contain the following information:

###### § 910.130 Cost sharing (EPACT).

In addition to the requirements of 2 CFR 200.306 the following requirements apply to research, development, demonstration and commercial application activities:

(a) Cost sharing is required for most financial assistance awards for research, development, demonstration and commercial applications activities initiated after the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on August 8, 2005. This requirement does not apply to:

(1) An award under the small business innovation research program (SBIR) or the small business technology transfer program (STTR); or

(2) A program with cost sharing requirements defined by other than Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 including other sections of the 2005 Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

(b) A cost share of at least 20 percent of the cost of the activity is required for research and development except where:

(1) A research or development activity of a basic or fundamental nature has been excluded by an appropriate officer of DOE, generally an Under Secretary; or

(2) The Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce or eliminate the cost sharing requirement for a research and development activity of an applied nature.

(c) A cost share of at least 50 percent of the cost of a demonstration or commercial application activity is required unless the Secretary has determined it is necessary and appropriate to reduce the cost sharing requirements, taking into consideration any technological risk relating to the activity.

(d) Cost share shall be provided by non-Federal funds unless otherwise authorized by statute. In calculating the amount of the non-Federal contribution:

(1) Base the non-Federal contribution on total project costs, including the cost of work where funds are provided directly to a partner, consortium member or subrecipient, such as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center;

(2) Include the following costs as allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles:

(i) Cash;

(ii) Personnel costs;

(iii) The value of a service, other resource, or third party in-kind contribution determined in accordance with Subpart E&#x2014;Cost Principles&#x2014;of 2 CFR part 200.

###### § 910.132 Research misconduct.

(a) A recipient is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research of any kind under an award from DOE including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:

means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.

means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.

means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.

means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.

means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.

means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.

means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.

(c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:

(1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;

(2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).

(3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.

(d) DOE may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:

(1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;

(2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;

(3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,

(4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.

(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.

(f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and DOE, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:

(1)The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: Protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.

(2)The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.

(3)The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.

(4)To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.

(5)If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.

(g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.

(h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.

###### § 910.133 Deviation authority.

(a)(1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with § 910.372, exceptions under 2 CFR 200.102, and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 910.130 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities are not subject to this section.

(2) A single-case deviation is a deviation which applies to one financial assistance transaction and one applicant, recipient, or subrecipient only.

(3) A class deviation is a deviation which applies to more than one financial assistance transaction, applicant, recipient, or subrecipient.

(b)The DOE/NNSA officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section may authorize a deviation only upon a written determination that the deviation is&#x2014;

(1) Necessary to achieve program objectives;

(2) Necessary to conserve public funds;

(3) Otherwise essential to the public interest; or

(4) Necessary to achieve equity.

(c)(1) A deviation request must be in writing and must be submitted to the responsible DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer. An applicant for a subaward or a subrecipient shall submit any such request through the recipient.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section&#x2014;

(i) A single-case deviation may be authorized by the responsible HCA.

(ii) A class deviation may be authorized by the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee.

(3) Whenever the approval of OMB, other Federal agency, or other DOE/NNSA office is required to authorize a deviation, the proposed deviation must be submitted to the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee for concurrence prior to submission to the authorizing official.

(d)Whenever a request for a class deviation is approved, DOE/NNSA will identify this class deviation (as applicable) in the Notice of Funding Opportunity(s) that may be affected.

(e)A recipient may use a deviation in a subaward only with the prior written approval of a DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer.

##### Subpart C [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Post Award Federal Requirements for For-Profit Entities

###### § 910.350 Applicability of 2 CFR part 200.

(a) As stated in 2 CFR 910.22, unless otherwise noted in this part , the definition of Non-Federal entity found in 2 CFR 200.1 is expanded for DOE to include for-profit organizations in addition to states, local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education (IHE), and nonprofit organizations.

(b) A for-profit organization is defined as one that distributes any profit not reinvested into the business as profit or dividends to its employees or shareholders.

(c) Subpart D of 2 CFR part 910 contains specific changes to 2 CFR part 200 that apply only to For-Profit Recipients and, unless otherwise specified, subrecipients. In some cases, the coverage in Subpart D will replace the language in a specific section of 2 CFR part 200.

###### § 910.352 Cost Principles.

For For-Profit Entities, the Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR 31.2 (Contracts with Commercial Organizations) must be followed in lieu of the Cost principles contained in 2 CFR 200.400 through 200.476, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document. This applies to For-Profit entities whether they are recipients or subrecipients.

###### § 910.354 Payment.

(a) For-Profit Recipients are an exception to 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) which requires that non-Federal entities be paid in advance as long as certain conditions are met.

(b) For For-Profit Recipients who are paid directly by DOE, reimbursement is the preferred method of payment. Under the reimbursement method of payment, the Federal awarding agency must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency reasonably believes the request to be improper.

###### § 910.356 Audits.

See Subpart F of this part (Sections 910.500 through 910.521) for specific DOE regulations which apply to audits of DOE's For-Profit Recipients. For-Profit entities are an exception to the Single Audit requirements contained in Subpart F of 2 CFR 200 and therefore the regulations contained in 2 CFR 910 Subpart F apply instead.

###### § 910.358 Profit or fee for SBIR/STTR.

(a) As authorized by 2 CFR 200.400 (g), DOE may expressly allow non-federal entities to earn a profit or fee resulting from Federal financial assistance.

(b) DOE allows a profit or fee to be paid under two of its financial assistance programs only: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR).

(c) Awards under these programs will contain a specific provision which allows a profit or fee to be paid.

(d) Profit or Fee is unallowable for all other DOE programs which award grants and cooperative agreements.

###### § 910.360 Real property and equipment.

(a)Recipients may purchase real property or equipment with an acquisition cost per unit of $5,000 or more in whole or in part with Federal funds only with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or in accordance with express award terms.

(b)Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient, subject to all terms and conditions of the award and that the recipient shall:

(1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, as may be determined by the contracting officer;

(2) Not encumber or permit any encumbrance on the real property or equipment without the prior written approval of the contracting officer;

(3) Use and dispose of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section; and

(4) Properly record, and consent to the Department's ability to properly record if the recipient fails to do so, UCC financing statement(s) for all equipment purchased with Federal funds (Financial assistance awards made under the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program are exempt from this requirement unless otherwise specified within the grant agreement); such a filing is required when the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $1,000,000, and the Contracting Officer may require it in his or her discretion when the Federal share is less than $1,000,000. These financing statement(s) must be approved in writing by the contracting officer prior to the recording, and they shall provide notice that the recipient's title to all equipment (not real property) purchased with Federal funds under the financial assistance agreement is conditional pursuant to the terms of this section, and that the Government retains an undivided reversionary interest in the equipment. The UCC financing statement(s) must be filed before the contracting officer may reimburse the recipient for the Federal share of the equipment unless otherwise provided for in the relevant financial assistance agreement. The recipient shall further make any amendments to the financing statements or additional recordings, including appropriate continuation statements, as necessary or as the contracting officer may direct.

(c)If the recipient fails at any time to comply with any of the conditions or requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, then the contracting officer may:

(1) Notify the recipient of noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339, which may lead to suspension or termination of the award;

(2) Impose special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206 and 200.208 as amended by 910.372;

(3) Issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;

(4) In the case of a failure to properly record UCC financing statement(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, effect such a recording; and

(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.

(d)As provided in 2 CFR 200.306(h), depending upon the purpose of the Federal award, a recipient may offer the fair market value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the recipient holds conditional title to the property and the Government has an undivided reversionary interest in the share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project. The property is treated as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and to the provisions of 2 CFR 200.311 and 200.313.

(e)Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.

(f)Unless a statute and the award terms expressly provide for the vesting of unconditional title to real property or equipment with the recipient, the real property or equipment acquired wholly or in part with Federal funds is subject to the following:

(1) During the Project Period, the recipient must make real property and equipment available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:

(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.

(2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or if, as may be determined by the contracting officer, the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, or if the recipient suspends work on the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, if:

(i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used;

(ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded Federal award; and

(iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iv) If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the recipient must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

(g)(1) If, as determined by the contracting officer, an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, or if the recipient has suspended work on the project, the recipient has the following options:

(i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.

(ii) If the property is equipment (rather than real property) and with the written approval of the contracting officer, the recipient may replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment.

(iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

(iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.

(2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:

(i) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:

(A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to a third party designated by the contracting officer provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred; or

(B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.

(3) If the contracting officer fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

###### § 910.362 Intellectual property.

(a)This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement made to a For-Profit entity by DOE.

(b)In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.

(c)&#x2014;

(1)Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)&#x2014;No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.

(2)Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:

(i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;

(ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or

(iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.

(3)Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.

(d)(1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data&#x2014;General”.

(2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.

(3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.

(e)(1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data&#x2014;Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.

(2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.

(f)If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data&#x2014;SBIR Program”.

(g)(1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.

(2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201&#x2013;1.

(3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.

###### § 910.364 Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.

(a) Unless otherwise instructed, a recipient that obtains title to an invention made under an award shall submit annual reports on the utilization or efforts to obtain utilization of the invention for at least 10 years from the date the invention was first disclosed to DOE (Utilization Reports). Utilization Reports shall include at least the following information:

(1) Status of development;

(2) Date of first commercial sale or use;

(3) Gross royalties received by the recipient;

(4) The location of any manufacture of products embodying the subject invention; and

(5) Any such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify.

(b) To the extent data or information supplied in a Utilization Report is considered by the recipient to be privileged and confidential and is so marked by the recipient, DOE agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.

###### § 910.366 Export Control and U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.

(a)Any recipient of any award for research, development and/or demonstration must comply with all applicable U.S. laws regarding export control.

(b)It is the policy of DOE to ensure that DOE-funded research, development, and/or demonstration projects foster domestic manufacturing. Funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), therefore, may require that applicants submit a “U.S. Manufacturing Plan” in their applications. Such FOAs may encourage U.S. Manufacturing Plans to include proposals by recipients and any sub-recipients to manufacture DOE-funded technologies in the United States; however, the FOAs will also state that these plans should not include requirements regarding the source of inputs used during the manufacturing process. Regardless of whether such plans will be part of the merit review criteria or a program policy factor, and to the extent legally permissible, all awards subject to this subpart, including subawards, for research, development, and/or demonstration, must include a provision that provides plans by the recipient and any subrecipients to support manufacturing in the United States of technology developed under the award. The recipient and any subrecipients must agree to make those plans binding on any assignee or licensee or any entity otherwise acquiring rights to any subject invention or developed technology covered under the award. A recipient, subrecipient, assignee, licensee, or any entity otherwise acquiring the rights to any subject invention or developed technology may request a waiver or modification of U.S. manufacturing plans from DOE. DOE will determine whether to approve such a waiver in light of equitable considerations, including, for example, whether the requester satisfactorily shows that the planned support is not economically feasible and whether there is a satisfactory alternative net benefit to the U.S. economy if the requested waiver or modification is approved.

###### § 910.368 Change of control.

(a) Change of control is defined as any of the following:

(1) Any event by which any individual or entity other than the recipient becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the recipient;

(2) The recipient merges with or into any entity other than in a transaction in which the shares of the recipient's voting stock are converted into a majority of the voting stock of the surviving entity;

(3) The sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the recipient to any individual or entity other than the recipient in one or a series of related transactions;

(4) The adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the recipient; or

(5) Where the recipient is a wholly-owned subsidiary at the time of award or novation, and the recipient's parent entity undergoes a change of control as defined in this section.

(b) When the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $10,000,000 or DOE requests the information in writing, the recipient must provide the contracting officer with documentation identifying all parties who exercise control in the recipient at the time of award.

(c) When there is a change of control of a recipient, or the recipient has reason to know a change of control is likely, the recipient must notify the contracting officer within 30 days of its knowledge of such change of control. Such notification must include, at a minimum, copies of documents necessary to reflect the transaction that resulted or will result in the change of control, and identification of all entities, individuals or other parties to such transaction. Failure to notify the contracting officer of a change of control is grounds for suspension or termination of the award for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.

(d) The contracting officer must authorize a change of control for the purposes of the award. Failure to receive the contracting officer's authorization for a change of control may lead to a suspension of the award, termination for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or imposition of special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 910.372. Special award conditions may include but are not limited to:

(1) Additional reporting requirements related to the change of control; and

(2) Suspension of payments due to the recipient.

###### § 910.370 Novation of financial assistance agreements.

(a) Financial assistance agreements are not assignable absent written consent from the contracting officer. At his or her sole discretion, the contracting officer may, through novation, recognize a third party as the successor in interest to a financial assistance agreement if such recognition is in the Government's interest, conforms with all applicable laws and the third party's interest in the agreement arises out of the transfer of:

(1) All of the recipient's assets; or

(2) The entire portion of the assets necessary to perform the project described in the agreement.

(b) When the contracting officer determines that it is not in the Government's interest to consent to the novation of a financial assistance agreement from the original recipient to a third party, the original recipient remains subject to the terms of the financial assistance agreement, and the Department may exercise all legally available remedies under 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343, or that may be otherwise available, should the original recipient not perform.

(c) The contracting officer may require submission of any documentation in support of a request for novation, including but not limited to documents identified in 48 CFR Subpart 42.12. The contracting officer may use the format in 48 CFR 42.1204 as guidance for novation agreements identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

###### § 910.372 Special award conditions.

(a) In addition to the requirements of 2 CFR 200.206, the following actions may require the use of Specific Conditions as identified in 2 CFR 200.208:

(1) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award;

(2) Has a change of control as defined in § 910.368;

(3) Fails to comply with real property and equipment requirements at § 910.360; or

(4) Is not otherwise responsible.

##### PARTS 1100-1103 [RESERVED]

##### PART 1104 - IMPLEMENTATION OF GOVERNMENTWIDE GUIDANCE FOR GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS

###### § 1104.1 Purpose of this part.

This part provides an update to the DoD interim implementation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR part 200. It supersedes the initial interim implementation of that guidance that DoD adopted in 2 CFR part 1103 on December 19, 2014.

###### § 1104.100 Award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.

DoD Components must conform the format of new grants and cooperative agreements to the standard award format specified in part 1120 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) (2 CFR part 1120). The standard format provides locations within the award for:

(a) General terms and conditions, including the administrative and national policy requirements discussed in § 1104.105(a) and (b), respectively.

(b) Any award-specific terms and conditions discussed in § 1104.110.

###### § 1104.105 Regulations governing DoD Components' general terms and conditions.

(a)On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, the following regulatory provisions govern the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements:

(1) The provisions of parts 1126 through 1138 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR parts 1126 through 1138, which comprise subchapter D of this chapter) govern the administrative requirements to be included in the general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(2) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.

(b)Part 1122 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR part 1122) governs the national policy requirements to be included in DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to all types of entities.

###### § 1104.110 Regulations governing DoD Components' award-specific terms and conditions.

On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200:

(a) The guidance in 2 CFR part 200 governs administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions used to supplement the general terms and conditions of a new grant or cooperative agreement awarded to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe.

(b) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.

###### § 1104.115 Regulations governing DoD Components' internal procedures.

On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, DoD Components' internal pre-award, time-of-award, and post-award procedures will continue to comply with requirements in parts 21 and 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 21 and 22) and other applicable Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) policies.

###### § 1104.120 Definitions.

(a)means the regulations in chapter I, subchapter C of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, and chapter XI of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations.

(b)See part 1108 of the DoDGARs for definitions of other terms used in this part.

##### PARTS 1105-1107 [RESERVED]

##### PART 1108 - DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN SUBCHAPTERS A THROUGH F OF THIS CHAPTER

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 1108.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part provides:

(1) Definitions of terms used in subchapters A through F of this chapter; and

(2) Background information as context for understanding terms related to assistance and acquisition purposes, legal instruments that DoD Components make at the prime tier, and lower-tier transactions into which recipients and subrecipients enter when carrying out programs at lower tiers under DoD awards.

(b) This part is, for DoD, the regulatory implementation of OMB guidance in subpart A of 2 CFR part 200.

####### § 1108.2 Precedence of definitions of terms in national policy requirements.

(a)Some portions of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) may use a term in relation to compliance with a national policy requirement in a statute, Executive order, or other source that defines the term differently than it is defined in subpart B of this part. For purposes of that particular national policy requirement, the definition of a term provided by the source of the requirement and any regulation specifically implementing it takes precedence over the definition in subpart B of this part. Using the definition of a term that takes precedence for each national policy requirement is therefore important when determining the applicability and effect of that requirement.

(b)(1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:

(i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);

(ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;

(iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103&#x2013;355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and

(iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.

(2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term “State” is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.

####### § 1108.3 Definitions of terms used in the Governmentwide cost principles or single audit requirements.

(a) Some DoDGARs provisions state that DoD Components or recipients must comply with single audit or cost principles requirements in a Governmentwide issuance that contains defined terms and include the requirements by reference to the issuance without restating them.

(b) For any term in one of those issuances, this part includes the definition of the term only if the DoDGARs also use that term directly.

(c) If the DoDGARs only use the term indirectly,through the DoDGARs' reference to the issuance, then this part will not include a definition and a user of the DoDGARs should consult definitions in the pertinent Governmentwide source, as follows:

(1) The Single Audit Act requirements for audits of recipients and subrecipients that are in subpart F of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200;

(2) The Governmentwide cost principles for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes that are contained in subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200; and

(3) The cost principles for for-profit entities at Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231.

####### § 1108.4 Definitions of terms that vary depending on context.

DoDGARs definitions of some terms related to types of legal instruments (“contract”) and purposes for which they are used (“procurement” or “acquisition”) may vary, depending on the context. Appendix A to this part provides additional information about those terms and their definitions.

###### Subpart B - Definitions

####### § 1108.10 Acquire.

means to:

(a) When the term is used in connection with a DoD Component action at the prime tier, obtain property or services by purchase, lease, or barter for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government.

(b) When the term is used in connection with a recipient action or a subrecipient action at a tier under a DoD Component's award:

(1) Purchase services;

(2) Obtain property under the award by:

(i) Purchase;

(ii) Construction;

(iii) Fabrication;

(iv) Development;

(v) The recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property to the project or program under the award to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement (including within the entity's share of the award's project costs the value of the remaining life of the property or its fair market value, rather than charging depreciation); or

(vi) Otherwise.

####### § 1108.15 Acquisition.

means the process of acquiring as described in:

(a) Paragraph (a) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with DoD Component actions at the prime tier.

(b) Paragraph (b) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with recipient or subrecipient actions at a lower tier under a DoD Component's award.

####### § 1108.20 Acquisition cost.

means the cost of an asset to a recipient or subrecipient, including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use.

(a) For example, when used in conjunction with:

(1) The purchase of equipment, the term means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.

(2) Equipment that a recipient or subrecipient constructs or fabricates&#x2014;or software that it develops&#x2014;under an award, the term includes, when capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):

(i) The construction and fabrication costs of that equipment; and

(ii) The development costs of that software.

(b) Ancillary charges, such as taxes, duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in, or excluded from, the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.

####### § 1108.25 Administrative offset.

means an action whereby money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a recipient is withheld to satisfy a delinquent debt.

####### § 1108.30 Advance payment.

means a payment that DoD or a recipient or subrecipient makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for project or program purposes.

####### § 1108.35 Advanced research.

means advanced technology development that creates new technology or demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology to new products and processes in a general way. Advanced research is most closely analogous to precompetitive technology development in the commercial sector (early phases of research and development on which commercial competitors are willing to collaborate, because the work is not so coupled to specific products and processes that the results of the work must be proprietary). It does not include development of military systems and hardware where specific requirements have been defined. It is typically funded in Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.

####### § 1108.40 Agreements officer.

means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate technology investment agreements.

####### § 1108.45 Applied research.

means efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, such as new materials, devices, methods and processes. It typically is funded in Applied Research (Budget Activity 2) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. Applied research often follows basic research but may not be fully distinguishable from the related basic research. The term does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered for sale or acquisition, efforts that are within the definition of “development.”

####### § 1108.50 Approved budget.

means, in conjunction with a DoD Component award to a recipient, the most recent version of the budget the recipient submitted, and the DoD Component approved (either at the time of the initial award or subsequently), to summarize planned expenditures for the project or program under the award. It includes:

(a) All Federal funding made available to the recipient under the award to use for project or program purposes.

(b) Any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.

(c) Any options that have been exercised but not any options that have not yet been exercised.

####### § 1108.55 Assistance.

means the transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments that DoD Components use to provide assistance.

####### § 1108.60 Award.

means a grant, cooperative agreement, technology investment agreement, or other nonprocurement instrument subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs. Within each part of the regulations, the term includes only the types of instruments subject to that part.

####### § 1108.65 Award administration office.

means a DoD Component office that performs post-award functions related to the administration of grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment agreements, or other nonprocurement instruments subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs.

####### § 1108.70 Basic research.

means efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. For the purposes of the DoDGARs, basic research includes:

(a) Research-related, science and engineering education and training, including graduate fellowships and research traineeships; and

(b) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.

####### § 1108.75 Capital asset.

means a tangible or intangible asset used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which is capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Capital assets include:

(a) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software) whether acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, lease-purchase, exchange, or through capital leases; and

(b) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life (not ordinary repairs and maintenance).

####### § 1108.80 Claim.

means a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to an award seeking as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of an award term or condition, or other relief arising under or relating to the award. A routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted to a claim by written notice to the grants or agreements officer if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

####### § 1108.85 Cognizant agency for indirect costs.

means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs for a particular entity may be different than the cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for indirect costs:

(a) For an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe is assigned as described in the appendices to 2 CFR part 200. See 2 CFR 200.19 for specific citations to those appendices.

(b) For a for-profit entity, normally will be the agency with the largest dollar amount of pertinent business, as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR 42.003.

####### § 1108.90 Contract.

means a procurement transaction, as that term is defined in this subpart. A contract is a transaction into which a recipient or subrecipient enters. It is therefore distinct from the term “procurement contract,” which is a transaction that a DoD Component awards at the prime tier.

####### § 1108.95 Contracting activity.

means an activity to which the Head of a DoD Component has delegated broad authority regarding acquisition functions pursuant to 48 CFR 1.601.

####### § 1108.100 Contracting officer.

means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate procurement contracts and make related determinations and findings.

####### § 1108.105 Contractor.

###### Subpart A - Award Cover Pages

####### § 1120.100 Purpose of the award cover pages.

The award cover pages comprise the portion of each DoD Component award of a grant or cooperative agreement or modification to an award that the DoD Component transmits to the recipient when it makes the award or modification. It:

(a) Contains basic information about the award or modification and the recipient, as described in § 1120.105;

(b) Is signed by a DoD grants officer; and

(c) Also is signed by the recipient's authorized organizational representative if the award or modification is a bilateral action that is to be signed on behalf of both the DoD Component and recipient.

####### § 1120.105 Content of the award cover pages.

The award cover pages of each DoD Component grant or cooperative agreement or modification:

(a) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the award or modification:

(1) The name of the DoD Component awarding office that made the award or modification.

(2) The award number (Federal Award Identification Number or FAIN) and, if the action is a modification, the modification number.

(3) The type of award&#x2014;grant or cooperative agreement.

(4) The type of award action&#x2014;new award, funding modification, or administrative (non-funding) modification.

(5) For a new award or funding modification:

(i) A brief description of the project or program supported by the award.

(ii) The amount of the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds due to the current action and any accompanying change in the total amount of cost sharing or matching required under the award.

(iii) The cumulative amounts of Federal funds and any corresponding non-Federal share obligated to date (the sums of the amounts of the current action and the cumulative amounts of prior obligations and deobligations).

(iv) The total amount of the project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, the Federal share of that amount, and the non-Federal share even if that share is “zero.”

(v) The total value of the award; the Federal share of that total value (which includes Federal funding obligated to date; future incremental funding actions; and options for which amounts have been predetermined, whether or not they have been exercised yet); and the non-Federal share of that total value (total cost sharing or matching required under the award).

(vi) A table such as the following may be helpful in clearly presenting the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (vi) of this section:

(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):

(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or “cluster”) of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).

(ii) What the award includes in addition to the cover pages&#x2014;the:

(A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;

(A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and

(B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.

(iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements (Federal statutes).

(v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award.

(vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.

(b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:

(1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

(2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or “doing business as” name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.

(3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.

(4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.

(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply&#x2014;the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate&#x2014;if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.

(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:

(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.

(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.

(2) The DoD Component obtains approval for a deviation from the requirement to use a DoD form from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in accordance with the procedures specified in 32 CFR 21.340.

(b) If a DoD Component does not use a DoD form for its award cover pages, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, its award cover pages must include all information specified in § 1120.105.

###### Subpart B - Award-specific Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.200 Purpose and inclusion of award-specific terms and conditions.

A DoD Component must include with each award, for transmission to the recipient, any terms and conditions needed to communicate requirements specific to the individual award as distinct from the more broadly applicable requirements in the general terms and conditions. For a modification to an award, only changes to previously transmitted terms and conditions must be included.

####### § 1120.205 Organization and wording of award-specific terms and conditions.

DoD Components should organize and word award-specific terms and conditions to make them as clear and easy to understand as possible for the benefit of recipients, award administrators, auditors, and others who may need to use them. The DoDGARs specify neither a standard organization nor standard wording for award-specific terms and conditions.

###### Subpart C - General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.300 Purpose of general terms and conditions.

The general terms and conditions comprise the portion of the award with requirements that apply to a class of awards (awards under a particular program or type of program activity, such as research or education, or for a class of recipients, such as for-profit entities).

####### § 1120.305 Requirement for general terms and conditions.

Each DoD Component must establish at least one set of general terms and conditions. A DoD Component may have more than one set, as it deems appropriate to reflect differences in its award terms and conditions across different programs, classes of recipients, or types of activity.

####### § 1120.310 Use of plain language.

(a) DoD Components must use plain language in:

(1) General terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Those awards are subject to the DoDGARs provisions in:

(i) 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That standard wording uses personal pronouns.

(ii) 2 CFR part 1122, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing commonly applicable national policy requirements. That standard wording also uses personal pronouns.

(2) The national policy requirements in Subdivision B of general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities, which also are subject to 2 CFR part 1122.

(b) Although the DoDGARs currently do not provide standard wording for terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements for use in awards to for-profit entities, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to use plain language and personal pronouns in their terms and conditions of those other awards. The DoDGARs provisions that specify the administrative requirements to incorporate into those terms and conditions are listed in § 1120.510(b).

####### § 1120.315 Availability of general terms and conditions.

(a) A DoD Component that issues a funding opportunity announcement under which grants or cooperative agreements may be awarded must maintain on the internet the general terms and conditions for those awards if:

(1) The distribution of the funding opportunity announcement is unlimited; and

(2) The DoD Component anticipates making 10 or more awards per year using those general terms and conditions.

(b) Each DoD Component that maintains a set of general terms and conditions on the internet must also maintain an archive of previous versions of that set at the same internet location, for use by recipients, post-award administrators, auditors, and others. Each version must be labeled with its effective dates.

(c) If a DoD Component has a set of general terms and conditions that is not subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the DoD Component chooses not to maintain that set on the internet:

(1) It must tell potential applicants or proposers in the funding opportunity announcement, if there is one, how they may view or obtain a copy of the general terms and conditions; or

(2) If there is no funding opportunity announcement (if it is a noncompetitive program for which all recipients are known in advance), the DoD Component must provide the general terms and conditions to each recipient no later than the time of award.

###### Subpart D - Preamble to the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.400 Requirement to include a preamble.

Each DoD Component must include a preamble as Subdivision A of each set of general terms and conditions it maintains, to provide information to help recipients understand how to use those terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.405 Content of the preamble.

The preamble for each set of general terms and conditions must include at least the following information elements, organized in the order shown:

(a)This should show the articles within each other subdivision of the general terms and conditions (Subdivisions B and C for administrative and national policy requirements and, if needed, Subdivision D for programmatic requirements).

(b)This element identifies the programs, types of awards, and types of recipient entities that are subject to the set of general terms and conditions.

(c)This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions. The version date of each article within the general terms and conditions must be indicated in parentheses following the title of the article, to help a recipient identify the articles that changed from previous versions of the general terms and conditions.

(d)The purpose of this element of the preamble is to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.111(b) by informing each recipient that:

(1) It must translate any of the award content (including attachments to it and any material incorporated into the award by reference) into another language to the extent that the recipient's compliance with the award's terms and conditions depends upon a significant number of its employees who are not fluent in English being able to read and comprehend that content.

(2) If it does translate any award content into another language, either as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or at its own initiative, the original award content in the English language will take precedence in the event of an inconsistency between the award requirements in the English and translated versions.

(e)This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with § 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.

(f)Providing the definitions of words and phrases that are used in the general terms and conditions and defined in the DoDGARs is more helpful to recipients than referring them to the DoDGARs to find the definitions.

###### Subpart E - Administrative Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.500 Scope of administrative requirements.

The administrative requirements in an award are post-award and after-the-award requirements for recipients in the following subject matter areas:

(a) Financial and program management, to include financial management system standards, payment, allowable costs, program and budget revisions, audits, cost sharing or matching, and program income.

(b) Property administration, to include title vesting, property management system standards, and use and disposition of tangible and intangible property.

(c) Recipient procurement procedures.

(d) Financial, programmatic, property, and other reporting.

(e) Records retention and access, remedies, claims and disputes, and closeout.

####### § 1120.505 Location of administrative requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes administrative requirements as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.510 Sources of administrative requirements.

The source of administrative requirements is:

(a) Subchapter D of this chapter for cost-type grant and cooperative agreement awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Subchapter D provides a standard set of articles into which a DoD Component organizes the administrative requirements. It also provides standard wording for the general terms and conditions in those articles, as explained in the overview of subchapter D in 2 CFR part 1126.

(b) 32 CFR part 34 for grant and cooperative agreement awards to for-profit entities. That part of the DoDGARs specifies the administrative requirements for awards to those entities but does not provide standard articles or terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.515 Incorporation of administrative requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

(a) For cost-type awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements by:

(1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of administrative requirements provided in subchapter D of this chapter (the standard wording of the articles is in the appendices to 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138) into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

(2) Stating any variations from that standard wording (any sections or paragraphs that the DoD Component adds, revises, or omits, consistent with the DoDGARs prescription for use of the standard wording).

(b) Incorporating that standard wording into general terms and conditions by reference, rather than including the full text of each article of the general terms and conditions, will make it easier for those who must use terms and conditions of multiple DoD Components' awards (recipients, DoD Components' post-award administrators, and auditors) to quickly identify how each Component's general terms and conditions differ from the DoD standard wording.

###### Subpart F - National Policy Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.600 Scope of national policy requirements.

National policy requirements, as defined in 2 CFR 1122.2, are requirements:

(a) That are prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refer to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

(c) That are outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements, as described in § 1120.500.

####### § 1120.605 Location of national policy requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes national policy requirements as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.610 Source of national policy requirements.

The source of national policy requirements to be included in a grant or cooperative agreement is 2 CFR part 1122.

####### § 1120.615 Incorporation of national policy requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

For the same reason given in § 1120.515(b), DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements for awards to all types of recipient entities, including for-profit entities, by:

(a) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of national policy requirements provided in the appendices to 2 CFR part 1122 into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

(b) Stating any variations from that standard wording (any added, omitted, or revised paragraphs, based on which national policy requirements apply to programs and recipients for which the general terms and conditions are used).

###### Subpart G - Programmatic Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.700 Scope of programmatic requirements.

A requirement is most appropriately included in the programmatic requirements portion of the general terms and conditions if it:

(a) Is not in one of the subject matter areas covered by the administrative requirements in Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions, as described in § 1120.500.

(b) Does not meet the criteria in § 1120.600 for a national policy requirement.

(c) Broadly applies to awards using the general terms and conditions. Requirements that apply to relatively few of those awards are more appropriately included in the award-specific terms and conditions of the individual awards to which they apply.

(d) Is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future, rather than for a limited period of time. For example, a requirement in an annual appropriations act that applies specifically to funding made available by that act is better addressed through the award-specific terms and conditions of awards or modifications to which it applies.

####### § 1120.705 Location of programmatic requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes programmatic requirements as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.710 Examples of programmatic requirements.

Examples of provisions appropriately included as programmatic requirements in Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions include:

(a) Requirements for recipients to acknowledge the DoD Component's support in publications of results of the projects or programs performed under awards.

(b) Requirements for recipients to promptly alert the DoD Component if they develop any information in the course of performing the projects or programs under their awards that, in their judgment, might adversely affect national security if disclosed.

(c) Reservation of the Government's right to use non-Federal personnel in any aspect of post-award administration of awards, with appropriate nondisclosure requirements placed on those personnel to protect sensitive information about recipients or the projects or programs supported by their awards.

###### § 1120.1 Purpose of this part.

This part of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) establishes a standard award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby makes the content easier for a recipient to locate in different DoD Components' awards.

###### § 1120.2 Applicability of this part.

(a)This part:

(1) Sets forth requirements for DoD Components that award grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) Does not impose requirements on recipients of DoD Components' awards.

(b)This part applies to grants and cooperative agreements, other than technology investment agreements (TIAs), awarded to any type of recipient entity.

###### § 1120.3 DoD Component implementation.

Each DoD Component that awards grants or cooperative agreements must:

(a) Conform the format of its awards to the standard format established by this part no later than [18 months after the effective date of the final rule].

(b) Update electronic systems it maintains for generating awards within 18 months of the issuance of a new or updated DoD form for the award cover pages, in order to implement that form in those systems, unless it has an approved deviation in accordance with § 1120.110.

###### § 1120.4 Elements and subelements of the standard award format in relation to the organization of this part.

(a) The standard award format has three major elements that are designated as Divisions I through III of the award.

(1) The first major element of the standard award format is comprised of the award cover pages. It is designated as Division I of the award.

(2) The second major element is comprised of any award-specific terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division II of the award.

(3) The last of the three major elements of the standard award format is comprised of the general terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division III of the award. It has four subelements that are designated as Subdivisions A through D of the general terms and conditions.

(i) The first subelement of the general terms and conditions is the preamble, which is designated as Subdivision A.

(ii) The second subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.

(iii) The third subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.

(iv) The last of the four subelements of the general terms and conditions is comprised of any programmatic requirements that apply to awards using those general terms and conditions. That subelement is designated as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.

(b) This part has seven subparts. Each subpart addresses one major element or subelement of the standard award format, as shown in Table 1:

##### PART 1121[RESERVED]

##### PART 1122 - NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 1122.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.

(b) It thereby implements:

(1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(2) National policy requirements, to the extent they apply, for general terms and conditions of DoD awards to for-profit firms, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities.

####### § 1122.2 Definition of “national policy requirement.”

For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:

(a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

(c) That is outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements in subchapters D or E of this chapter.

####### § 1122.3 Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.

Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define “Statein ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.

###### Subpart B - Terms and Conditions

####### § 1122.100 Purpose of this subpart.

This subpart provides:

(a) Direction to DoD Components on how to construct the four articles of national policy requirements for inclusion in the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements.

(b) Standard wording for national policy requirements that are more commonly applicable to DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.

####### § 1122.105 Where to find the terms and conditions.

(a) Appendices A through D of this part provide standard wording of terms and conditions for the four articles of national policy requirements. The articles address the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the recipient related to those national policy requirements.

(b) The following table shows which national policy terms and conditions may be found in each appendix to this part:

####### § 1122.110 Organization of each article of national policy requirements.

Each of NP Articles I through IV includes two sections.

(a) Section A of each article includes national policy requirements that are cross-cutting in that their applicability extends to many or all DoD awards. Appendices A through D to this part provide standard wording for each of those requirements.

(b) Section B of each article is the location in the award for program-specific national policy requirements. Section B is reserved in the standard wording of the articles provided in appendices A through D to this part.

####### § 1122.115 Cross-cutting national policy requirements.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the standard wording provided in appendices A through D to this part for each national policy requirement addressed in Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV, respectively, that may apply either to:

(1) A recipient of an award using those general terms and conditions; or

(2) A subrecipient of a subaward under an award using those general terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component may reserve or omit any paragraph appendices A through D to this part provide for Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV of its general terms and conditions if it determines that the national policy requirement addressed in that paragraph will not apply to any awards using those terms and conditions nor to any subawards under them.

(c)(1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

(2) A DoD Component in that case:

(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.

(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.

####### § 1122.120 Other national policy requirements.

If a DoD Component determines that awards using its general terms and conditions, or subawards under them, are subject to a national policy requirement that is not addressed in the standard wording appendices A through D to this part provide for cross-cutting requirements, the DoD Component must include the requirement in its general terms and conditions. It should add the requirement in Section B of NP Article I, II, III, or IV, as most appropriate to the subject matter of the requirement.

##### PARTS 1123-1124 [RESERVED]

##### PART 1125 - NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 1125.137 Who in the Department of Defense may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

Within the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of a Military Department, Head of a Defense Agency, Head of the Office of Economic Adjustment, and Head of the Special Operations Command have the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.

###### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

####### § 1125.220 What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), the Department of Defense does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

###### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

####### § 1125.332 What method must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

You as a participant in a covered transaction must include a term or condition in any lower-tier covered transaction into which you enter, to require the participant of that transaction to&#x2014;

(a) Comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180; and

(b) Include a similar term or condition in any covered transaction into which it enters at the next lower tier.

###### Subpart D - Responsibilities of DoD Officials Regarding Transactions

####### § 1125.425 When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

In addition to the four instances identified in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.425, you as a DoD Component official must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you obligate additional funding (, through an incremental funding action) for a pre-existing grant or cooperative agreement with an institution of higher education, as provided in 32 CFR 22.520(e)(5).

####### § 1125.437 What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

You as a DoD Component official must include a term or condition in each covered transaction into which you enter, to communicate to the participant the requirements to&#x2014;

(a) Comply with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part; and

(b) Include a similar term or condition in any lower-tier covered transactions into which the participant enters.

###### Subparts E-H [Reserved]

###### Subpart I - Definitions

####### § 1125.930 Debarring official (DoD supplement to Governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.930).

DoD Components' debarring officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as debarring officials for procurement contracts.

####### § 1125.937 DoD Component.

In this part, DoD Component means the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a Military Department, a Defense Agency, a DoD Field Activity, or any other organizational entity of the Department of Defense that is authorized to award or administer grants, cooperative agreements, or other nonprocurement transactions.

####### § 1125.1010 Suspending official (DoD supplement to Governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.1010).

DoD Components' suspending officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as suspending officials for procurement contracts.

###### § 1125.10 What does this part do?

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Department of Defense (DoD) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the Department of Defense to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103&#x2013;355, 108 Stat. 3327).

###### § 1125.20 Does this part implement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180 for all DoD nonprocurement transactions?

This part implements the OMB guidelines in 2 CFR part 180 for most DoD nonprocurement transactions. However, it does not implement the guidelines as they apply to prototype projects under the authority of Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&#x2013;160), as amended. The Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy maintains a DoD issuance separate from this part that addresses section 845 transactions.

###### § 1125.30 Does this part apply to me?

This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a&#x2014;

(a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970, as supplemented by subpart B of this part), other than a section 845 transaction described in § 1125.20;

(b) Respondent in a DoD Component's nonprocurement suspension or debarment action;

(c) DoD Component's debarment or suspension official; or

(d) DoD Component's grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into a nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

###### § 1125.40 What policies and procedures must I follow?

(a)You must follow the policies and procedures specified in applicable sections of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by this part.

(b)In implementing the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, this part supplements eight sections of the guidance, as shown in the following table. For each of those sections, you must follow the policies and procedures in the OMB guidance, as supplemented by this part.

(c)For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that is not listed in paragraph (b) of this section, DoD policies and procedures are the same as those in the OMB guidance.

#### Subchapter D - Administrative Requirements Terms and Conditions for Cost-Type Grants and Cooperative Agreements to Nonprofit and Governmental Entities

##### PART 1126 - SUBCHAPTER D OVERVIEW

###### § 1126.1 Purposes of this subchapter.

This subchapter of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations:

(a) Addresses general terms and conditions governing administrative requirements for use by DoD Components when awarding cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. It does so by providing:

(1) A standard organization of the administrative requirements into articles of general terms and conditions, each of which is in a specific subject area.

(2) Standard wording for those articles; and

(3) Associated prescriptions for DoD Component's use of the standard wording to construct their general terms and conditions, which allow for adding, omitting, or varying in other ways from the standard wording in certain situations.

(b) Thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 as it relates to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

###### § 1126.2 Applicability of this subchapter.

(a)This subchapter:

(1) Applies to DoD Components that award cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(2) Does not directly impose requirements on a recipient of a DoD Component's award but does do so indirectly, through the DoD Component's compliance with this subchapter when it constructs its general award terms and conditions. The terms and conditions delineate the rights and responsibilities of the recipient and the Federal Government under the award.

(b)This subchapter applies to DoD Components' cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to types of entities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, other than Technology Investment Agreements that are addressed in 32 CFR part 37.

###### § 1126.3 Exceptions from requirements in this subchapter.

(a)A DoD Component may not grant any exception to the requirements in this subchapter if the exception is:

(1) Prohibited by statute, executive order, or regulation;

(2) Inconsistent with the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

(b)Other exceptions are permitted from requirements in this subchapter for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes as follows:

(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may incorporate a requirement that is inconsistent with the requirements in this subchapter if that requirement is specifically authorized or required by a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

(2)The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may approve an individual exception affecting only one award in accordance with procedures stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

(3)A DoD Component's terms and conditions for small awards may apply less restrictive requirements than those specified in this subchapter (a small award is an award for which the total value of obligated funding through the life of the award is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold).

(4)The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering or his or her designee may approve any class exception affecting multiple awards other than small awards, with OMB concurrence if the class exception is for a requirement that is inconsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. Procedures for DoD Components' requests for class exceptions are stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

###### § 1126.4 Relationship to other portions of the DoD grant and agreement regulations.

The administrative requirements specified in this subchapter complement:

(a) Provisions of 32 CFR part 34 that address administrative requirements for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities; and

(b) Requirements in 32 CFR part 37 for technology investment agreements.

###### § 1126.5 Organization of this subchapter.

This subchapter is organized into six parts in addition to this overview part. Each part provides standard wording and prescriptions for articles of general terms and conditions that address administrative requirements in a particular subject area. Table 1 shows the subject area and articles corresponding to each part:

###### § 1126.6 Organization of the other parts of this subchapter.

(a) Each of parts 1128 through 1138 of this subchapter is organized into subparts and appendices.

(1) Each appendix provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for one of the articles of general terms and conditions that the part addresses.

(2) For each appendix addressing a particular article, the part has an associated subpart that provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording for that article.

(b) For example, Table 1 to § 1126.5 indicates that 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles I through VII and the prescriptions for DoD Components' use of that standard wording.

(1) FMS Article I on financial management system standards is the first of the articles that 2 CFR part 1128 covers. Appendix A to 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Article I. The associated subpart of 2 CFR part 1128, subpart A, provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording of that article.

(2) Appendices B through G of 2 CFR part 1128 provide the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles II through VII, respectively. The associated subparts, Subparts B through G, provide the corresponding prescriptions for DoD Components.

##### PART 1128 - RECIPIENT FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Financial Management System Standards (FMS Article I)

####### § 1128.100 Purpose of FMS Article I.

FMS Article I specifies standards for recipients' financial management systems. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.302, 200.303, and 200.328; and

(b) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting.

####### § 1128.105 Content of FMS Article I.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for recipients' financial management systems.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for FMS Article I.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

(i) Reserve Section A of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will receive:

(A) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or

(B) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.

(ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments (through unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between financial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve paragraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.

###### Subpart B - Payments (FMS Article II)

####### § 1128.200 Purpose of FMS Article II.

FMS Article II contains requirements related to payments under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305.

####### § 1128.205 Content of FMS Article II.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address payment method; payment timing and amounts, which relate to cash management; frequency of payment requests; and matters related to recipients' depositories, including interest earned on advance payments.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix B to this part provides for FMS Article II with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as described in §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220.

####### § 1128.210 Payment requirements for States.

(a)Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:

(1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under “major programs,” as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.

(2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States&#x2014;awards that are not under major programs.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.

(2)If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:

(i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and

(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.

####### § 1128.215 Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements&#x2014;advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1)With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:

(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and

(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:

(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and

(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.

(2)A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:

(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;

(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;

(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and

(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.

####### § 1128.220 Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.

(2)A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.

###### Subpart C - Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit (FMS Article III)

####### § 1128.300 Purpose of FMS Article III.

FMS Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies what costs are allowable as charges to awards and when they are allowable. It also specifies restrictions on payment of fee or profit. It thereby implements OMB guidance in §§ 200.209 and 200.309 and Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.201(b)(1) and 200.323(c), as those sections apply to the cost principles to be used in relation to subawards and contracts, respectively.

####### § 1128.305 Content of FMS Article III.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address allowability of costs and permissibility of fee or profit.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for FMS Article III with appropriate reservations as described in §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325.

####### § 1128.310 Cost principles.

(a)The set of Governmentwide cost principles applicable to a particular entity type governs the allowability of costs that may be:

(1) Charged to each cost-type:

(i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;

(ii) Subaward to a subrecipient of that entity type at any tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement; and

(iii) Procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type awarded by a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

(2) Considered in establishing the amount of any:

(i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under a grant or cooperative agreement, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or

(ii) Fixed-price procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type that is awarded by either a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Because almost all DoD grants and cooperative agreements are cost-type awards, appendix C includes wording for Section A of FMS Article III that specifies use of the applicable Governmentwide cost principles in the determination of the allowability of costs.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve any paragraph of appendix C's wording for Section A of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the Component is certain that no entities of the type to which the paragraph applies could be recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions or recipients of subawards or procurement transactions at any tier under those awards.

####### § 1128.315 Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge publication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article III.

(2)A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using those general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.320 Period of availability of funds.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the period during which Federal funds are available for obligation by recipients for project or program purposes.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of FMS Article III to specify the period of availability of funds.

####### § 1128.325 Fee or profit.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients may neither receive fee or profit nor pay fee or profit to subrecipients.

(b)A DoD Component must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of FMS Article III to specify the limitation on payment of fee or profit.

###### Subpart D - Revision of Budget and Program Plans (FMS Article IV)

####### § 1128.400 Purpose of FMS Article IV.

FMS Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to changes in recipients' budget and program plans. It thereby implements OMB guidance in § 200.308 of 2 CFR part 200 and partially implements § 200.209 and Subpart E of that part.

####### § 1128.405 Content of FMS Article IV.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the changes in budget and program plans for which a recipient is required to request DoD Component prior approval and the procedures for submitting those requests.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article IV the § wording appendix D to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.410 through 1128.430.

####### § 1128.410 Approved budget.

(a)As described in 2 CFR 200.308(a), the approved budget for a grant or cooperative agreement may include both the Federal and non-Federal shares of funding under the award or only the Federal share.

(b)For DoD grants and cooperative agreements, the approved budget includes the Federal share and any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must include the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of FMS Article IV.

####### § 1128.415 Prior approvals for non-construction activities.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.

(b)The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:

(1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).

(2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).

(3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).

(d)A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:

(1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).

(2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).

(e)With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):

(1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.

(2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:

(i) Which, if any, to waive; and

(ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions (a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).

(f)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:

(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).

(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).

(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.

(g)(1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.

(2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.

(3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies (the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14&#x2013;R.

(h)Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:

(1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.

(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.

(3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).

(4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section (to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).

(5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.

####### § 1128.420 Prior approvals for construction activities.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction grant or cooperative agreement or construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction activities.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) through terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

(c)In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or awards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:

(1) Must include the wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.

(2) May reserve or remove the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C of FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction activities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as Section C).

####### § 1128.425 Additional prior approval for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

(a)Guidance on an additional prior approval requirement for grants or cooperative agreements that support both construction and non-construction activities is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5).

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5) through terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

(c)If a DoD Component establishes general terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities, the DoD Component may add the prior approval requirement for funding or budget transfers between construction and non-construction activities that is described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5). The wording that appendix D to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article IV includes a reserved paragraph B.3 in which the DoD Component may add appropriate wording to include that prior approval requirement.

####### § 1128.430 Procedures for prior approvals.

(a)Guidance on procedures related to recipient requests for prior approval is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i).

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i) for prior approval requests through award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component must:

(1) Include the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph D.1 of FMS Article IV of its general terms and conditions.

(2) Insert appropriate wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph D.2 that appendix D to this part includes in FMS Article IV to specify:

(i) The format the recipient must use when it requests approval for budget revisions. As described in 2 CFR 200.308(h), the award term may allow the recipient to submit a letter of request or otherwise must specify that the recipient use the same format it used for budget information in its application or proposal.

(ii) Any other procedural instructions related to requests for prior approvals for budget or program revisions (to whom requests must be submitted) that are common to the awards using the general terms and conditions. For procedural instructions that will vary from one award to another, it is appropriate to include wording that points to the award-specific terms and conditions as the source of the information.

###### Subpart E - Non-Federal Audits (FMS Article V)

####### § 1128.500 Purpose of FMS Article V.

FMS Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to audits required under the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C., chapter 75). The article thereby implements for grants and cooperative agreements the OMB guidance in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

####### § 1128.505 Content of FMS Article V.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address audit requirements.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix E to this part provides for FMS Article V.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the wording in appendix E if there will be no subawards to for-profit entities under any award using those terms and conditions.

###### Subpart F-Cost Sharing or Matching (FMS Article VI)

####### § 1128.600 Purpose of FMS Article VI.

FMS Article VI sets forth requirements concerning recipients' cost sharing or matching under awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.306 and 200.308(c)(1)(vii); and

(b) 2 CFR 200.434, in conjunction with FMS Article III in appendix C to this part.

####### § 1128.605 Content of FMS Article VI.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards under which there may be required cost sharing or matching must specify the criteria for determining allowability, methods for valuation, and requirements for documentation of cost sharing or matching.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VI the wording appendix F to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve FMS Article VI of its general terms and conditions if it determines that there will be no cost sharing or matching required under any of the awards using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.610 General requirement for cost sharing or matching.

(a)(1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:

(i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover pages.

(ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any that involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.

(iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of cost share or match.

(2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific contributions included in the approved budget (to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the approved budget).

(b)To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS Article VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require recipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

####### § 1128.615 General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.

(a)The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost sharing or matching under grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the allowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms and conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to accept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.620 Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.

(a)The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides that unrecovered indirect costs may only be included as part of cost sharing and matching with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

(b)DoD Components must allow any recipient that either has an approved negotiated indirect cost rate or is using the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f) to count unrecovered indirect costs toward any required cost sharing or matching under awards. The basis for this policy is that recipients' indirect costs that are allowable and allocable to DoD projects and programs are legitimate costs of carrying out those projects and programs.

(c)To implement the policy in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section C of FMS Article VI unless a statute requires otherwise.

####### § 1128.625 Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(3) specifies that, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, recipients may use program income to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of their awards.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using either:

(i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1128.720; or

(ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of § 1128.720, that includes use of at least some program income as cost sharing or matching.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.

####### § 1128.630 Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:

(1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and

(2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:

(1)(i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.

(ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property (counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.

(2)(i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:

(A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and

(B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).

(ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.

(iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.

(c)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the wording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, or other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.635 Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(e) through (j) and 2 CFR 200.434(b) through (g) specifies how to value and document various types of third-party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the OMB guidance described in paragraph (a) of this section as it applies to valuation and documentation of third-party in-kind contributions, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording Section VI of appendix F to this part provides as Section F of FMS Article VI.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve any paragraph of the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section F of FMS Article VI if the DoD Component determines that there will be no possibility of third-party in-kind contributions under awards using those terms and conditions.

###### Subpart G-Program Income (FMS Article VII)

####### § 1128.700 Purpose of FMS Article VII.

FMS Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for program income that recipients earn. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.80 and 200.307.

####### § 1128.705 Content of FMS Article VII.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the kinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the recipient's accountability for it, and related matters.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VII the wording appendix G to this part provides, unless, as authorized by §§ 1128.710 through 1128.725, there are revisions to the wording of Sections A and E of the article or Section D is reserved.

####### § 1128.710 What program income includes.

(a)Under the definition of “program income” at 2 CFR 200.80 and related OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements may include as program income:

(1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and

(2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.

(b)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

(c)&#x2014; (1)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

(2)If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:

(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

(ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

####### § 1128.715 Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.

(a)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that recipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and royalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.

(2)If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for establishing recipient obligations for the license fees and royalties described in paragraph (a) of this section, it may reserve Section D of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.720 Program income use.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.

(1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:

(i)A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.

(ii)A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.

(iii)Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.

(iv)The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.

(2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.

(c)(1)In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:

(i) Research awards; and

(ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.

(2)A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:

(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: “1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”

(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: “If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF&#x2013;425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts.”

(3)A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: “You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”

(4)A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

####### § 1128.725 Program income after the period of performance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency regulations, grant or cooperative agreement terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that a recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

(b)A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of FMS Article VII the wording for that section that is provided in appendix G to this part. That wording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

###### § 1128.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning financial and program management, including recipients' financial management systems, payments, cost sharing or matching, program income, budget and program revisions, audits, allowable costs, and periods of availability of funds.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:

(1) Sections 200.80, 200.209, and 200.302 through 200.309;

(2) Sections 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting; and

(3) Subparts E and F.

###### § 1128.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1128.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1128.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

##### PART 1130 - PROPERTY ADMINISTRATION: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Title to Property (PROP Article I)

####### § 1130.100 Purpose of PROP Article I.

PROP Article I specifies in whom and under what conditions title to property vests under the award. It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements:

(a) Pertaining to vesting of title to property, in 2 CFR 200.311(a), 200.312(a), 200.313(a), 200.314(a), and 200.315(a).

(b) Pertaining to the property trust relationship in 2 CFR 200.316.

####### § 1130.105 Title to property acquired under awards.

(a)Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other than by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in PROP Articles II&#x2013;IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.

(b)&#x2014;(1)If a DoD Component has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either unconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II&#x2013;IV and VI. This subpart refers to acquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority&#x2014;and elects to use it&#x2014;as “exempt property.”

(2)(i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property (equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research&#x2014;without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate&#x2014;if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.

(ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:

(A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.

(B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.

(C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Unless a DoD Component has a statute authorizing it to identify acquired property as exempt property, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, it must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article I.

(2)(i) If a DoD Component has statutory authority such as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and elects to use that authority for awards subject to its general terms and conditions, it must insert wording in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I to:

(A) Identify the type or types of property it is exempting from the standard requirements for title vesting, use, and disposition contained in PROP Articles II through IV and VI and reporting requirements contained in REP Article III of the general terms and conditions.

(B) If it is exempting the property from some, but not all, of the standard requirements, identify the requirements to which the exempt property will be subject.

(ii) Paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I in general terms and conditions used for research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research generally should provide for vesting of title to acquired equipment and supplies in those types of entities when they are conducting basic or applied research subject only to the three conditions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

####### § 1130.110 Property trust relationship.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:

(1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was acquired or improved; and

(2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's use and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title to real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:

(1) Must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except that a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

(2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the wording of Section B of PROP Article I to require recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

####### § 1130.115 Title to federally owned property.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government and include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I to indicate that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government; or

(2) Reserve Section C if it provides no federally owned property under its awards.

####### § 1130.120 Federal interest in donated property.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Federal Government acquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the recipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in donated real property or equipment; or

(2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market value of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.

####### § 1130.125 Federal interest in property improved under awards.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the Federal interest in improvements to real property or equipment that results if a recipient directly charges the costs of the improvements to an award.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in improved real property or equipment; or

(2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

###### Subpart B - Property Management System (PROP Article II)

####### § 1130.200 Purpose of PROP Article II.

(a) PROP Article II prescribes standards for:

(1) Insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards;

(2) The system that a recipient uses to manage both equipment that is acquired or improved in whole or in part under awards and federally owned property.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 and 200.313(d)(1) through (4), and partially implements 2 CFR 200.313(b).

####### § 1130.205 Insurance coverage for real property and equipment.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 includes a requirement for recipients' insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under grants and cooperative agreements and states that federally owned property need not be insured unless required by Federal award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to provide insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards. However, unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards will not require recipients to insure federally owned property.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article II; or

(2) Reserve Section A of PROP Article II if there will be no real property or equipment acquired or improved under awards using those terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

####### § 1130.210 Other property management system standards for States.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the standards for States' property management systems.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article II; or

(2) Reserve Section B of PROP Article II if no State will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be accountable for federally owned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

####### § 1130.215 Other property management system standards for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the standards for property management systems of institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article II; or

(2) Reserve Section C of PROP Article II if no institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe will acquire or improve equipment, in whole or in part, or be accountable for federally owned property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

###### Subpart C - Use and Disposition of Real Property (PROP Article III)

####### § 1130.300 Purpose of PROP Article III.

PROP Article III specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of real property acquired or improved under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) and (c).

####### § 1130.305 Use of real property.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) states that, except as otherwise provided by Federal statute or the Federal awarding agency, a recipient must use real property acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the recipient must not dispose of the property or encumber its title or other interests.

(b)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards must permit recipients to do the following:

(1) While real property acquired or improved under an award still is needed for the authorized purpose, also use it for other projects or programs that either are supported by DoD Components or other Federal agencies or not federally supported, as long as that use does not interfere with the property's use for the authorized purpose.

(2) After the real property no longer is needed for the authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award administration office, use the property on other federally supported projects or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property was acquired or improved.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article III; or

(2) If a statute or program regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies different requirements for recipients' use of real property, substitute alternative wording for Section A to specify those requirements.

####### § 1130.310 Disposition of real property.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c):

(1) Addresses the recipient's responsibility to request disposition instructions for real property when the recipient no longer needs it for the originally authorized purpose; and

(2) Identifies three alternative disposition methods those instructions may specify.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c) through award terms and conditions that govern disposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article III to specify requirements concerning disposition of real property acquired or improved under awards.

###### Subpart D - Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies (PROP Article IV)

####### § 1130.400 Purpose of PROP Article IV.

PROP Article IV specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of equipment and supplies in which there is a Federal interest. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.313(a) through (c), 200.313(d)(5), and 200.313(e) as that guidance applies to requirements for use and disposition of equipment; and

(b) 2 CFR 200.314, as that guidance applies to requirements for use and disposition of supplies.

####### § 1130.405 Property subject to PROP Article IV.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must identify the types of non-exempt property to which requirements for use and disposition of equipment and supplies apply.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article IV. That wording identifies the categories of equipment and supplies in which there is a Federal interest.

####### § 1130.410 Requirements for a State's use and disposition of equipment.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) sets forth basic conditions for use of equipment acquired under a grant or cooperative agreement that apply when title to the equipment is vested in a recipient conditionally, because the awarding agency either does not have statutory authority to vest title in the equipment unconditionally or elects not to do so.

(2) 2 CFR 200.313(b) provides that a State must use, manage, and dispose of equipment in accordance with State laws and procedures.

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.313(a) and (b) through award terms and conditions that govern States' use and disposition of equipment.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for a State's use and disposition of equipment in which there is a Federal interest.

####### § 1130.415 Use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) sets forth basic conditions for use of equipment acquired under a grant or cooperative agreement that apply when title to the equipment is vested in a recipient conditionally, because the awarding agency either does not have statutory authority to vest title in the equipment unconditionally or elects not to do so.

(2) 2 CFR 200.313(c) provides the parameters for use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

(3) 2 CFR 200.313(d)(5) calls for use of sales procedures to ensure highest possible return when selling equipment.

(b)For equipment in which there is a Federal interest under awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, or Indian tribes, DoD implements through award terms and conditions the following portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to use of equipment prior to the time of its disposition:

(1) 2 CFR 200.313(a) and (c); and

(2) 2 CFR 200.313(d)(5), as it applies to equipment sales prior to the time of disposition, to offset the acquisition cost of replacement equipment.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for use of equipment described in paragraph (b) of this section.

####### § 1130.420 Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.313(e) addresses disposition of original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or cooperative agreement by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.313(e) through award terms and conditions that govern disposition of original or replacement equipment acquired under an award by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe when there is a Federal interest in the equipment.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for disposition of equipment described in paragraph (b) of this section.

####### § 1130.425 Use and disposition of supplies.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.314 sets forth requirements for use and disposition of supplies acquired under a grant or cooperative agreement.

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.314 through award terms and conditions that govern use and disposition of supplies acquired under awards either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article IV to specify the requirements for use and disposition of acquired supplies.

###### Subpart E - Use and Disposition of Federally Owned Property (PROP Article V)

####### § 1130.500 Purpose of PROP Article V.

PROP Article V specifies requirements for recipients' use and disposition of federally owned property. It implements the portion of OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a) that applies to disposition of federally owned property.

####### § 1130.505 Content of PROP Article V.

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(a) Include the wording appendix E to this part provides for PROP Article V to specify requirements for use and disposition of federally owned property; or

(b) Reserve PROP Article V if there is no possibility of recipients or subrecipients being accountable for federally owned property under awards using those terms and conditions.

###### Subpart F - Intangible Property (PROP Article VI)

####### § 1130.600 Purpose of PROP Article VI.

PROP Article VI sets forth the rights and responsibilities of recipients and the Federal Government with respect to intangible property. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315.

####### § 1130.605 Copyrights asserted in works developed or otherwise acquired under awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(b) addresses recipients' and the Federal Government's rights related to works that recipients may copyright under grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.315(b) through award terms and conditions that specify recipient and DoD rights with respect to copyrightable works.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article VI to affirm the recipient's right to assert copyright in works it develops or otherwise acquires under an award, as well as DoD's right to use the works for Federal purposes.

####### § 1130.610 Inventions developed under awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(c) states that recipients of grants and cooperative agreements are subject to applicable regulations concerning patents and inventions, including Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR part 401.

(b)In implementing 2 CFR 200.315(c) for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, DoD:

(1) Extends to other entities the patent rights provisions of chapter 18 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code and 37 CFR part 401 that directly apply to small business firms and nonprofit organizations. This broadened applicability is in accordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in Executive Order 12591, “Facilitating Access to Science and Technology.”

(2) Establishes a requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their awards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.

(3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by recipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.

(c)(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government must include the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI, with one permitted exception. The exception is that a DoD Component may reserve or substitute alternative wording for paragraph B.2.b of Section B of PROP Article VI, as appropriate, if it elects to:

(i) Omit the requirement for final invention reports;

(ii) Substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” to provide an additional 30 days for recipient's submissions of final reports after the end date of the period of performance; or

(iii) Include a requirement for recipients to submit information about each patent application they submit for a subject invention, interim listings of all subject inventions, or both, which the Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR 401.5(f)(2) and (3) permit agencies to require.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards to support scholarships or fellowships, training grants, or other awards for primarily educational purposes must replace the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI with an alternative award provision stating that the Federal Government will have no rights to inventions made by recipients.

(3) AA DoD Component developing general terms and conditions for awards other than those described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section should:

(i) Consult its intellectual property counsel if it anticipates that recipients may develop patentable inventions under its awards, to identify any applicable statutes or regulations and determine an appropriate substitute for the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI; or

(ii) Reserve Section B of PROP Article VI if it does not expect development of any patentable inventions under those awards.

####### § 1130.615 Data produced under awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(d) and (e) addresses rights in data under grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.315(d) and (e) through award terms and conditions.

(c)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article VI.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve paragraph C.2 of Section C of PROP Article VI in its general terms and conditions if:

(i) Those terms and conditions will not be used for research awards; and

(ii) The DoD Component determines that no research data as defined in 2 CFR 200.315 will be generated under the awards using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1130.620 Intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(a) addresses use and disposition of intangible property that is acquired under grants and cooperative agreements (in addition to vesting of title, which is implemented in § 1130.105 and appendix A to this part).

(b)DoD implements 2 CFR 200.315(a) through award terms and conditions that govern use and disposition of intangible property that is acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article VI.

###### § 1130.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning equipment, supplies, and real, intangible, and federally owned property.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 through 200.316, as that guidance applies to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements.

###### § 1130.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1130.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

##### PART 1132 - RECIPIENT PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A-Procurement Standards for States (PROC Article I)

####### § 1132.100 Purpose of PROC Article I.

PROC Article I of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for a State's procurement of property and services under grants or cooperative agreements. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.317 and partially implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(d) and 200.213.

####### § 1132.105 Content of PROC Article I.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for States' procurement systems.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for PROC Article I.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may instead reserve PROC Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will receive:

(i) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or

(ii) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.

###### Subpart B - Procurement Standards for Institutions of Higher Education, Nonprofit Organizations, Local Governments, and Indian Tribes (PROC Article II)

####### § 1132.200 Purpose of PROC Article II.

PROC Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies procurement procedures for a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement other than a State or for-profit entity. It thereby:

(a) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.323, 200.324(a) and (b), and 200.325;

(b) Partially implements 2 CFR 200.205(d) and 200.213; and

(c) Implements, in conjunction with PROC Article III, 2 CFR 200.326.

####### § 1132.205 Procurement procedures.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for procurement systems of institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(b)In order to implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B provides for Sections A through F of PROC Article II.

####### § 1132.210 Procurement of recovered materials.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for procurement of recovered materials if State agencies or agencies of a political subdivision of a State may receive awards using those terms and conditions or be subrecipients under those awards.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(1) Use the wording that appendix B provides for Section G of PROC Article II, to specify requirements for a local government or other political subdivision of a State to comply with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requirements; or

(2) Reserve Section G if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that a political subdivision of a State will receive either:

(i) An award using those terms and conditions; or

(ii) A subaward under an award using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1132.215 Review of recipient procurement documents.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must:

(1) Include a requirement for recipients to make technical specifications for proposed procurements available upon the DoD Component's request, as described in 2 CFR 200.324(a).

(2) Reserve the DoD Component's right to review a recipient's pre-procurement documents when any of the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.324(b)(1) through (5) apply and the recipient is not exempted from the requirement in accordance with 2 CFR 200.324(c).

(b)To implement the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B to this part provides for Section H of PROC Article II.

####### § 1132.220 Bonding requirements.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require each recipient to meet minimum bonding requirements if it awards any construction or facility improvement contract with a value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. A recipient would instead use its own bonding requirements if the DoD Component determined that the recipient's bonding policy and requirements are adequate to protect Federal interests.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix B to this part provides for Section I of PROC Article II. The DoD Component may include a provision in the award-specific terms and conditions to override Section I of PROC Article II in each award to a recipient for which it made the determination about the recipient's bonding policy and requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve Section I if the DoD Component determines that there will be no construction or facility improvement contracts with values in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold under awards using its general terms and conditions.

###### Subpart C - Contract Provisions for Recipient Procurements (PROC Article III)

####### § 1132.300 Purpose of PROC Article III.

PROC Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies provisions that recipients must include in contracts under their awards, as applicable. It thereby:

(a) Implements, in conjunction with PROC Articles I and II, OMB guidance concerning recipients' contract provisions under grants and cooperative agreements in 2 CFR 200.317 and 200.326;

(b) Partially implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(d) and 200.213 concerning suspension and debarment requirements; and

(c) Partially implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.517 concerning retention and access of auditors' records.

####### § 1132.305 Administrative requirements.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include in their contracts standard administrative requirements related to remedies, termination, allowable costs, rights in copyrights and data, records access and retention, and reporting.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to include provisions in their contracts that require the contractors to comply with applicable national policy requirements.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording that appendix C to this part provides for Section B of PROC Article III.

(2)(i) The Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (40 U.S.C. 3141&#x2013;44, 3146, and 3147) does not apply to a program carried out through grants or cooperative agreements unless another statute makes it apply to that program. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore may not include the provision that appendix C to this part includes as paragraph B.2 of PROC Article III unless another statute makes the Wage Rate Requirements statute apply to the program using those general terms and conditions.

(ii) If a DoD Component determines that any of the other national policy requirements in Section B will not apply to any of the awards subject to its general terms and conditions, the DoD Component may reserve the paragraphs of Section B addressing those requirements. Should a future need arise to include the requirements in a given award, the DoD Component may include them as award-specific terms and conditions.

###### § 1132.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' purchases of property (supplies, equipment, and real property) and services.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.326, and appendix II to 2 CFR part 200, as those portions of 2 CFR part 200 apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.205(d), 200.213, and 200.517.

###### § 1132.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1132.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as follows:

(a) As described in 2 CFR 1126.3, and

(b) Based on any language in 2 CFR 200.110(a) regarding the applicability of the procurement standards in 2 CFR part 200.

###### § 1132.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through C to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through C, respectively):

##### PART 1134 - FINANCIAL, PROGRAMMATIC, AND PROPERTY REPORTING: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Performance Management, Monitoring, and Reporting (REP Article I)

####### § 1134.100 Purpose of REP Article I.

REP Article I of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to recipient reporting on program performance. It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.328; and

(b) Portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that relate to performance reporting.

####### § 1134.105 Performance reporting for construction awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(c) notes that agencies rely heavily on onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under construction grants and cooperative agreements and states that agencies may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.

(b)DoD Components may require performance reports under construction awards only when necessary and, to reduce recipient burdens, should coordinate the performance reporting with financial reporting to the maximum extent practicable.

(c)(1) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and does not need performance reports for those awards, it:

(i) Should reserve Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions;

(ii) Must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 and 1134.145 to include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Sections E and G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, in order to require recipients to promptly report significant developments and reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits.

(iii) Must follow the specifications in § 1134.140 to insert wording in Section F of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, to tell recipients where and how to submit any reports of significant developments.

(2) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and determines that it needs performance reports for those awards:

(i) It may tailor the template and content that appendix A to this part provides for Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as needed to specify the reporting requirements or, as appropriate, instead integrate those requirements into REP Article II on financial reporting. The form, format, or data elements that the DoD Component specifies for any of those performance reports must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320, to use OMB-approved information collections if more than 9 recipients will be subject to the reporting requirement.

(ii) It must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 through 1134.145 concerning Sections E through G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

####### § 1134.110 Performance reporting for non-construction awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report that it does not need.

(b)&#x2014;(1)DoD Components should waive requirements for interim performance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers have an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program oversight during the period of performance.

(2)&#x2014;(i)DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under research awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary purpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve as a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, and conclusions or recommendations of the research.

(ii)DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final performance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving requirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.

(c)Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms and conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. A DoD Component must either use the wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, in accordance with §§ 1134.115 through 1134.145, to:

(1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance reporting (see § 1134.115);

(2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see § 1134.120);

(3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see § 1134.125);

(4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see § 1134.130);

(5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see § 1134.135);

(6) Specify reporting procedures (see § 1134.140); and

(7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see § 1134.145).

####### § 1134.115 Content and forms, formats, or data elements for interim and final performance reporting under non-construction awards.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328(b)(2) state that Federal awarding agencies must require recipients to use standard OMB-approved information collections for reporting performance information.

(2) 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) list types of information that performance reports under non-construction grants and cooperative agreements will contain, as appropriate, unless other collections are approved by OMB.

(b)(1) The content of the information collections that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for non-construction awards must include the elements listed in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) that are appropriate to the projects or programs subject to those general terms and conditions.

(2) Forms, formats, and data elements that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for performance reporting under non-construction awards must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 to use OMB-approved information collections, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

(3) To the maximum extent practicable, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that recipients use Governmentwide standard forms, formats, and data elements that also are used by other Federal agencies for similar programs, recipients, and types of awards (the Research Performance Progress Report format or any successor to it that OMB clears for interim performance progress reports under research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations).

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section A of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify the form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for interim and final performance reports. Section A of REP Article I may specify a different requirement for final performance reports than interim reports.

####### § 1134.120 Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) addresses performance reporting frequency under grants and cooperative agreements and due dates.

(1)The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent than annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (when more frequent reporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).

(2)The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:

(i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; and

(ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the agency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.

(b)DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and due dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and added specifications concerning reporting periods:

(1)DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.

(2)For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim performance reports on a cumulative basis&#x2014;the second and any subsequent performance report should address only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier interim performance reports.

(3)If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual circumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component must specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim reports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(c)A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:

(1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;

(2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and

(3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the reporting period.

####### § 1134.125 Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due date if a recipient submits a justified request.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):

(i)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:

(A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.

(B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.

(ii)A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.

(2)&#x2014;(i)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.

(ii)Final reports for research awards must be cumulative (each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:

(1) Must either:

(i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is either 90 or 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance, as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(i), by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only the number of days (90 or 120 calendar days) appropriate for the type of awards; or

(ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the 90 calendar day due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for non-construction awards other than research, by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only “120 calendar days” in lieu of “90 calendar days.”

(2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for final reports (that research awards require cumulative final reports).

####### § 1134.130 Requesting extensions of due dates for performance reports.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that, if a recipient submits a justified request for an extension in the due date for any interim or final performance report under a grant or cooperative agreement, an agency may extend the due date.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that a recipient may request an extension of the due date for interim or final performance reports. DoD Components should grant requests that provide adequate justification. For a DoD Component that pre-approves a 30-day extension of due dates for final performance reports in its general terms and conditions, as described in § 1134.125(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii), any award-specific extensions would be beyond the pre-approved 30-day extension.

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section D of REP Article I on extensions of performance reporting due dates.

####### § 1134.135 Reporting significant developments.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(d) states that a recipient must promptly notify the awarding agency about significant developments under grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to report significant developments, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(d).

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section E of REP Article I on reporting of significant developments.

####### § 1134.140 Performance reporting procedures.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients about performance reporting procedures.

(b)To implement the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions must insert wording in Section F of REP Article I (which is reserved in the template for REP Article I that appendix A to this part provides), to specify:

(1) The office or offices to which a recipient must submit its interim and final performance reports, any requests in due dates for those reports, and any reports of significant developments; and

(2) How the recipient is to submit those reports and requests (email or other electronic submission method).

(3) For research awards, component must assure that the recipient final report complies with the distribution and marking requirements of DoD Manual 3200.14, Volume 1. This includes the requirement that all significant scientific or technological findings, recommendations, and results derived from DoD endeavors&#x2014;which shall include the final performance report at a minimum&#x2014;are recorded and provided to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Follow guidance in (b)(1) to inform recipients as the submission and distribution requirements (Component may choose to receive the report and submit to DTIC themselves or provide instructions to recipient on submission to DTIC).

(4) Access to Research Results

(i) For purposes of this term and condition, the following definition applies:

The final version of a peer-reviewed article for a professional journal publication disclosing the results of scientific research which is authored or co-authored by the recipient or funded, in whole or in part, with funds from a DoD award, that includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article.

(ii) The recipient shall ensure that any Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) repository, currently atEnsure that the Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted when it is accepted for publication, and when the final title and date of publication are known.

####### § 1134.145 Site visits.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(e) states that a Federal awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must state that the Federal Government reserves the right to make site visits as warranted.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section G of REP Article I concerning site visits.

###### Subpart B - Financial Reporting (REP Article II)

####### § 1134.200 Purpose of REP Article II.

REP Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to financial reporting. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 and the portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that are specific to financial reporting under grants and cooperative agreements.

####### § 1134.205 Reporting forms, formats, or data elements.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 states that Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to use only the standard OMB-approved Governmentwide data elements for collection of financial information, unless OMB approves other forms, formats, or data elements for financial information collection.

(b)DoD Components must collect financial information from recipients using OMB-approved forms, formats, or data elements.

(1) Unless current approvals expire, approved financial information collections include the Federal Financial Report (SF&#x2013;425) and Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF&#x2013;270). In the future, they would include any additional information collections that OMB approves.

(2) For all but the recipient's final financial report, a DoD Component may rely on financial information the recipient provides on the SF&#x2013;270 or other OMB-approved payment request form, format, or data elements if that financial information is sufficient to meet the DoD Component's needs. For the final report, the DoD Component must require the recipient to use the SF&#x2013;425 or other OMB-approved financial information collection.

(3) A DoD Component must obtain approval for any variations from OMB-approved forms or formats, including use of additional or substitute data elements or modification of the associated instructions for recipient entities submitting the information.

####### § 1134.210 Content of REP Article II.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify what financial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial reporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days after the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.

(2)In Section A of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-approved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the website where they can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports during the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed on the final report.

(3)In Section B of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which recipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it is due. However, this section of the article may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information already provided with payment requests (on the SF&#x2013;270).

(i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).

(ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.

(iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules&#x2014;which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards&#x2014;the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.

(4)Appendix B to this part provides wording for Section C of REP Article II to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 provides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to recipients, the wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-award administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any information they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the wording or supplement it if the DoD Component has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(5)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording for Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim or final financial reports.

(6)In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must submit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so (email or other electronic submission method).

###### Subpart C - Reporting on Property (REP Article III)

####### § 1134.300 Purposes of REP Article III.

REP Article III of the general terms and conditions provides a consolidated source that sets out required reports, notifications, requests, and accountings related to federally owned property and property that is acquired or improved under awards. The article is:

(a) The original source of requirements for recipients to:

(1) Submit periodic status reports and notifications of critical changes for real property (in paragraphs A.1 and A.2 of the article), which thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329;

(2) Submit an annual inventory of federally owned property (in paragraph C.1 of the article), which thereby partially implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a);

(3) Provide information on request about copyrighted works and data produced under awards (in paragraph D.2 of the article).

(b) A secondary source provided for the convenience of recipients and DoD post-award administrators that lists and refers to the original sources of requirements for recipients to:

(1) Request disposition instructions and account at closeout for real property (in paragraphs A.3 and A.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Article III and OAR Article VI;

(2) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for equipment (in paragraphs B.2 and B.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and IV, respectively;

(3) Account at closeout for equipment and supplies (in paragraph B.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in OAR Article VI and PROP Article IV;

(4) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for federally owned property (in paragraphs C.2 and C.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and V, respectively;

(5) Disclose and report on inventions developed under awards (in paragraph D.1), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI; and

(6) Request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards (in paragraph D.3 of the article), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI.

####### § 1134.305 Real property: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the real property reporting requirements described in § 1134.300(a)(1) and provide references to the related requirements described in § 1134.300(b)(1).

(b)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the wording of Section A of REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

(1)Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:

(i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic status reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real property). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which provides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real property.

(ii) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.b to specify the due date for each periodic status report in terms of the number of calendar days after the end of the period covered by the report (a report on the status of the property as of September 30 might be due 30 calendar days after that date).

(iii) May provide wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.c if there are other instructions&#x2014;a form, format, or information elements that a recipient must use (which must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320) or a particular office to which reports must be submitted, especially if reporting will continue beyond closeout of the award under which the real property was acquired or improved.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section A of REP Article III if it determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1134.310 Equipment and supplies: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that there is no requirement for routine periodic reporting about equipment acquired under an award and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(2) and (3) to requirements in other articles for notifications, requests, and accounting related to equipment and supplies.

(b)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of REP Article III.

####### § 1134.315 Federally owned property: inventory, notifications, and requests.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(4) to requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.

(b)(1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:

(i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or

(ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

(2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.

(c)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data elements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.

####### § 1134.320 Intangible property: disclosures, reports, and requests.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(3) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(5) and (6) to requirements in other articles for disclosures, reports, and requests related to intangible property.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of REP Article III.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve:

(i) Section D of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will have any intangible property for which they will be accountable to the Federal Government; or

(ii) Any of paragraphs D.1 through D.3, if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable to the Federal Government for the particular types of intangible property addressed by those paragraphs.

###### Subpart D - Reporting on Subawards and Executive Compensation (REP Article IV)

####### § 1134.400 Purpose of REP Article IV.

REP Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation.

####### § 1134.405 Content of REP Article IV.

(a)The requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation originate in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended (31 U.S.C. 6101 note). OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 170 implements those statutory requirements and appendix A to that part provides standard Governmentwide wording of an award provision.

(b)To implement the reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides as REP Article IV.

###### Subpart E - Other Reporting (REP Article V)

####### § 1134.500 Purpose of REP Article V.

REP Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to provide any type of report not addressed in REP Articles I&#x2013;IV.

####### § 1134.505 Content of REP Article V.

(a)Any requirement in a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for recipients to provide a type of report not addressed in REP Articles I&#x2013;IV must:

(1) Have a basis in a statute or regulation adopted in theafter an opportunity for public comment; and

(2) Use a form/format that has been approved by OMB under the PRA, as implemented by OMB in 5 CFR part 1320.

(b)(1) To implement any reporting requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following content in REP Article V, consistent with the PRA approval. Otherwise, REP Article V must be reserved.

(a) The name of the report and where a recipient can obtain it;

(b) For an interim report, the frequency with which it must be submitted and due date(s);

(c) For a final report, whether the report is due 90 days or, if the DoD Component has pre-approved a 30-day extension, 120 days after the end of the period of performance; and

(d) To what DoD office/official the report(s) must be submitted.

(2) If there is more than one such report, the DoD Component must show the information for each in separate sections of the article.

###### § 1134.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' reporting requirements.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance on reporting in 2 CFR part 170 and the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they relate to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:

(1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.327 through 200.329; and

(2) 2 CFR 200.300(b) as it relates to subaward reporting, 200.312(a) as it relates to inventories of federally owned property, and 200.343(a) as it relates to financial and performance reporting.

###### § 1134.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1134.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1134.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through D to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through D, respectively):

##### PART 1136 - OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information (OAR Article I)

####### § 1136.100 Purpose of OAR Article I.

OAR Article I sets forth requirements for recipients to maintain current information about themselves in the data system the Federal Government specifies as the repository for standard information about its business partners, currently the System for Award Management. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);

(b) 2 CFR part 25; and

(c) The portion of 2 CFR 200.300(b) that cites 2 CFR part 25 and the System for Award Management).

####### § 1136.105 Content of OAR Article I.

To implement the requirement described in § 1136.100, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the standard wording appendix A to this part provides as OAR Article I. A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the article in its general terms and conditions if it is certain that there will be no award using those general terms and conditions for which the Federal share of the award's total value will exceed $500,000.

###### Subpart B - Records Retention and Access (OAR Article II)

####### § 1136.200 Purpose of OAR Article II.

OAR Article II addresses rights and responsibilities concerning retention of records related to awards; access to recipients' records; and collection, transmission, and storage of information. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.337.

####### § 1136.205 Records retention period.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) The lead-in paragraph of 2 CFR 200.333 sets a standard retention period that is generally applicable to recipient records pertinent to grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(c) and (f) provide different standard retention periods specifically for records that are related either to real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the standard retention periods described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c)&#x2014;(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of OAR Article II.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may substitute alternative wording for paragraph A.3 of OAR Article II if the awards using those terms and conditions will be renewed quarterly or annually. The alternative wording for awards that will be renewed quarterly or annually would replace the words “final financial report” in paragraph A.3 with “quarterly financial report” or “annual financial report,” respectively.

####### § 1136.210 Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.333(a) provides for an extended retention period for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(b) provides that a recipient also is required to extend the retention period when a Federal awarding, cognizant, or oversight agency notifies it in writing to do so.

(b)(1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended retention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).

(2)(i) Other than the exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require recipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).

(ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the “retention period,” as that term is used in 2 CFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends beyond the standard 3-year retention period described in § 1136.205. That extension will enable disallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to retain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. Without that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which states that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient within the record retention period.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.215 Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333(e) provides the retention period for records related to program income earned under a grant or cooperative agreement after the end of the period of performance, if an agency establishes requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after that time.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions should not establish retention requirements for records related to program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Retention requirements for those records in general terms and conditions would be inconsistent with the statement in 2 CFR 1128.725 that a DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Section 1128.725 provides for use of general terms and conditions wording in FMS Article VII that establishes no such requirement. Section 1128.725 further states that exceptions for individual awards are properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of OAR Article II. If a DoD Component includes a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance, it also may include a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient's retention of the associated records.

####### § 1136.220 Records for joint or long-term use.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its custody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that the agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention requirement.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that they may be asked to transfer records, maintain them for joint use, or retain them for a longer period.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section D of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.225 Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 addresses the use of electronic and paper formats in the collection, transmission, and storage of information related to awards.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include provisions consistent with the guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 for recipients' use of electronic and paper formats to collect, transmit, and store information.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section E of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.230 Access to records.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.336 and 200.337 addresses Federal Government and public access to recipient records related to grants and cooperative agreements.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for Federal Government access to records consistent with 2 CFR 200.336 and address public access to records to implement the guidance in 2 CFR 200.337.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section F of OAR Article II.

###### Subpart C - Remedies and Termination (OAR Article III)

####### § 1136.300 Purpose of OAR Article III.

OAR Article III addresses remedies for noncompliance, including suspension and termination of awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 through 200.340 and 200.342.

####### § 1136.305 Content of OAR Article III.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify remedies available for addressing noncompliance with award terms and conditions, policies and procedures related to termination of awards, and effects of suspension and termination on allowability of costs.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for OAR Article III.

###### Subpart D - Claims, Disputes, and Appeals (OAR Article IV)

####### § 1136.400 Purpose of OAR Article IV.

OAR Article IV addresses claims, disputes, and appeals under awards. It thereby provides the award terms and conditions required by the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 and also implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.341.

####### § 1136.405 Content of OAR Article IV.

(a)The DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 require DoD Components' general terms and conditions to incorporate the procedures set forth in that section for processing claims and disputes and deciding appeals of grants officer's decisions.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV, with wording inserted in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2 to identify the Component's cognizant Grant Appeal Authority and provide his or her mailing or email address.

(2)A DoD Component may add one or more sections to the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV to state a requirement that recipients must provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters if:

(i) That requirement is in a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment; and

(ii) The statutory or regulatory requirement applies to awards using the DoD Component's general terms and conditions.

###### Subpart E - Collection of Amounts Due (OAR Article V)

####### § 1136.500 Purpose of OAR Article V.

OAR Article V addresses procedures for establishing, appealing, and collecting debts under DoD awards. It thereby:

(a) Provides requirements for recipients paralleling those for DoD Components in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.820;

(b) Augments requirements of OAR Article IV in any case in which a claim leads to a determination that a recipient owes an amount to DoD; and

(c) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.345.

####### § 1136.505 Content of OAR Article V.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how grants officers' decisions establish debts under awards, when debts become delinquent, how and when recipients may appeal, and how debts not paid in a timely manner are referred for debt collection.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides for OAR Article V.

###### Subpart F - Closeout (OAR Article VI)

####### § 1136.600 Purpose of OAR Article VI.

OAR Article VI addresses recipients' responsibilities for closeout of awards and subawards under them. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343.

####### § 1136.605 Content of OAR Article VI.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to closeout of awards and subawards, including recipients' liquidations of obligations, refunds of unobligated balances, and submission of final reports.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for OAR Article VI.

(2)Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a), a DoD Component may grant extensions to due dates for final reports.

(i) To pre-approve a 30-day extension for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports, a DoD Component may substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” in the wording appendix F to this part provides for paragraph C.4 of OAR Article VI. These pre-approved 30-day extensions in the general terms and conditions are for all awards using those terms and conditions; they therefore are separate and distinct from any additional extensions a recipient may later request for an individual award.

(ii) The parallel authorities for pre-approved extensions of due dates for final performance and invention reports are elsewhere. DoDGARs provisions in:

(A) 2 CFR 1134.125 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of performance reports by an appropriate substitution of wording in REP Article I of the general terms and conditions.

(B) 2 CFR 1130.610 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of final reports listing subject inventions under awards by an appropriate substitution of wording in PROP Article VI of the general terms and conditions.

(C) 2 CFR 1134.505 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of other types of final reports by inclusion of appropriate wording in REP Article V of the general terms and conditions.

###### Subpart G - Post-Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities (OAR Article VII)

####### § 1136.700 Purpose of OAR Article VII.

OAR Article VII addresses post-closeout funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after award closeout. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344.

####### § 1136.705 Content of OAR Article VII.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients with respect to funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after award closeout.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix G to this part provides for OAR Article VII.

###### § 1136.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning submission and maintenance of recipient information; records retention and access; remedies for noncompliance and termination; claims, disputes, and appeals; collection of amounts due; closeout; and after-the-award requirements.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in multiple portions of 2 CFR part 200, as those portions apply to general terms and conditions. Specifically, this part implements:

(1) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);

(2) 2 CFR 200.300(b) as it refers to requirements in 2 CFR part 25; and

(3) 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.345.

###### § 1136.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1136.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1136.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

##### PART 1138 - REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO SUBAWARDS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A-Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements (SUB Article I)

####### § 1138.100 Purpose of SUB Article I.

SUB Article I specifies requirements for a recipient to determine whether each transaction it makes at the next tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement is a subaward or a procurement transaction. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.201(a) and 200.330.

####### § 1138.105 Content of SUB Article I.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must:

(1) Require the recipient to determine the nature of transactions it makes under its award; and

(2) Inform the recipient about the effect of that determination on the procedures for awarding the transaction and the transaction's terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for SUB Article I.

###### Subpart B-Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities (SUB Article II)

####### § 1138.200 Purpose of SUB Article II.

####### § 1138.1205 Content of SUB Article XII.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a fixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements the recipient must include in those subawards.

(b)&#x2014; (1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII.

(2)

(i) In addition to the authorities provided in § 1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add wording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the Component's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the program or programs that use its general terms and conditions.

(ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix L provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, well-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being reimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.

###### § 1138.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' award and administration of subawards under DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1138.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart and the authorization in § 1138.5, which permit a DoD Component to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through L to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through L, respectively, as supplemented by the authorization in § 1138.5):

###### § 1138.5 Authority to omit or reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII.

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

(a) Omit SUB Articles II through XII that are the subject of this part if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to make subawards under awards using those terms and conditions. The DoD Component also may amend SUB Article I in that case, to state the prohibition on making subawards and limit the recipient's responsibility to ensuring that any transaction it awards at the next tier is a procurement transaction.

(b) Reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII that do not apply to the DoD Component's awards using those terms and conditions. For example, the DoD Component may reserve paragraphs in SUB Articles IV through IX specifying administrative requirements that flow down solely to subawards to States if it determines that there is no possibility of a subaward to a State under any of the awards using its general terms and conditions. Similarly, it may reserve SUB Article XII if it does not permit any fixed-amount subawards under its awards.

For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Department of Transportation policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

###### § 1401.325 What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1401.305(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must&#x2014;

###### §§ 1402.114-1402.203 [Reserved]

##### Subpart C - Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards

###### § 1402.204 What are the merit review requirements for competitive awards?

The requirements in this section apply to competitive grants and cooperative agreements unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute. Merit review procedures must be described or incorporated by reference in NOFOs (see 2 CFR part 200, appendix I, and 2 CFR 200.203). Pre-award considerations for both discretionary competitive and noncompetitive awards shall take into account the alignment of the award's purpose, goals, and measurement with the current DOI Government Performance and Results Act Strategic Plan including, the mission statement, vision, values, goals, objectives, strategies, and performance metrics therein, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

(a)Competition is expected in awarding discretionary funds, unless otherwise directed by Congress. When grants and cooperative agreements are awarded competitively, DOI requires that the competitive process be fair and impartial, that all applicants be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the announcement, and that no applicant receive an unfair competitive advantage. All competitive funding announcements, and all modifications/amendments to those announcements, must be posted on().

(b)Bureaus and offices must conduct reviews of applications submitted in response to the announcement and for selecting applicants for award following established merit review procedures. Bureaus and offices must conduct comprehensive, impartial, and objective review of applications based on the criteria contained in the announcement by individuals who have no conflicts of interest with respect to the competing proposal/applications or applicants. Bureaus and offices must ensure reviewers are qualified, applications are scored on the basis of announced criteria, consideration is given to the level of applicant risk and past performance, applications are ranked, and funding determinations are made.

(c)Bureaus and offices must develop an Evaluation and Selection Plan in concert with the notice of funding opportunity to ensure consistency, and to outline and document the selection process. The Evaluation and Selection Plan should be finalized prior to the release of the notice of funding opportunity. An Evaluation and Selection Plan is comprised of five basic elements:

(1) Merit review factors and sub-factors;

(2) A rating system (adjectival, color coding, numerical, or ordinal);

(3) Evaluation standards or descriptions that explain the basis for assignment of the various rating system grades/scores;

(4) Program policy factors; and

(5) The basis for selection.

(d)Bureaus and offices must initially screen applications/proposals to ensure that they meet the standards in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section before they are subjected to a detailed evaluation utilizing a merit review process specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The review system should include three phases: Initial Screening, Threshold Screening, and a Merit Review Evaluation Screening. Bureaus and offices may remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass the basic eligibility screening per paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.

(e)Bureaus and offices may return applications/proposals that are incomplete or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of theannouncement to the applicant to be corrected, modified, or supplemented, or may reject the application/proposal outright. Until the application/proposal meets the substantive requirements of the announcement and this part, it shall not be given detailed evaluation. Bureaus and offices may use discretion to determine the length of time for applicants to resolve application deficiencies.

(f)Bureaus and offices must consider the timeliness of the application submission. Applications that are submitted beyond the announced deadline date must be removed from the review process.

(g)Bureaus and offices are responsible for screening applications and proposals for the adequacy of the budget and compliance with statutory and other requirements. The SF&#x2013;424 and budget information (SF&#x2013;424A, SF&#x2013;424C, or OMB-approved alternate budget data collection) must be reviewed according to Department of the Interior policy.

(h)This is the final review stage where the technical merit of the application/proposal is reviewed. In the absence of a program rule or statutory requirement, program officials shall develop criteria that include all aspects of technical merit. Bureaus and offices shall develop criteria that are conceptually independent of each other, but all-encompassing when taken together. While criteria will vary, the basic criteria shall focus reviewers' attention on the project's underlying merit (significance, approach, and feasibility). The criteria shall focus not only on the technical details of the proposed project but also on the broader importance or potential impact of the project. The criteria shall be easily understood.

(i)Bureaus and offices must also consider risk thresholds during application/proposal review process. Elements to be considered may include organization; single audit submissions, past performance; availability of necessary resources, equipment, or facilities; financial strength and management capabilities; and procurement procedures; or procedures for selecting and monitoring subrecipients or sub-vendors, if applicable. For all non-Federal entities that receive an award, the Financial Assistance Officer must document the risk analysis.

(j)Upon receipt of a Memorandum of Appointment, each proposal evaluator and advisor must sign and return a Conflict of Interest Certificate to the Financial Assistance Officer. If an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the appointee may not evaluate or provide advice on a potential applicant's proposal until the conflict has been resolved or mitigated. Further, each proposal evaluator or advisor must agree to comply with any notice or limitation placed on the application. Upon completion of the review, the proposal evaluator or advisor shall return or destroy all copies of the application and accompanying proposals (or abstracts) to DOI; and unless authorized by the Financial Assistance Officer or agency designee, the reviewer shall not contact the non-Federal entity concerning any aspect of the application.

###### § 1402.329 What are the requirements for land acquired under an award?

(a)Bureaus and offices must ensure compliance with the prior written approval requirements for land acquisition in 2 CFR 200.439. Whenever a recipient is seeking DOI's approval to use award funds to purchase an interest in real property, the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, SF&#x2013;429&#x2013;B, Request to Acquire, Improve, or Furnish, or approved alternate standardized data collection, must be submitted to the bureau or office. The Financial Assistance Officer is responsible for ensuring that this requirement is met. All aspects of the purchase must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to purchases of land or interests in land.

(b)(1) Unless a waiver valuation applies in accordance with 49 CFR 24.102(c), land or interests in land that will be acquired under the award must be appraised in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, (UASFLA or the “Yellow Book”), developed and promulgated by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, 1155 15th Street NW, Suite 1111, Washington, DC 20005, by a real property appraiser licensed or certified by the State or States in which the property is located. The appraisal report shall be reviewed by a qualified review appraiser that meets qualifications established by the DOI Appraisal and Valuation Services Office (AVSO), which is responsible for appraisal and valuation services and policy across the Department. Bureaus and offices shall ensure that funds are not disbursed for purchases of land or interests in land without an appraisal accompanied by a written appraisal review report that complies with standards approved by AVSO. Where appraisals are required to support federally assisted land acquisitions, AVSO has oversight responsibilities for these appraisals, including those purchased through financial assistance actions in the various grant programs within the Department. AVSO will coordinate with grant programs to conduct periodic internal control review of appraisal and appraisal review reports prepared in conjunction with grant applications for land acquisition.

(ii) [Reserved]

(c)Land to be acquired under an award that is located outside the United States must be appraised by an independent real property appraiser licensed or certified in the country in which the property is located in accordance with any in-country appraisal standards, if they exist, or with International Valuation Standards, when such appraisals are available and financially feasible. Otherwise, the non-Federal entity must use the most widely accepted business practice for property valuation in the country where the property is located and provide to the awarding DOI bureau or office a detailed explanation of the methodology used to determine value.

(d)(1) For all financial assistance actions where real property is acquired under the Federal award, the recipient must submit reports on the status of the real property. Bureaus and offices must ensure recipients receive written notification of those reporting requirements, including reporting frequency/schedule, report content requirements, and submission instructions, at the time of award.

(2) If the interest in the land will be held for less than 15 years, reports must be submitted annually. If the interest in the land will be held for 15 years or more, then the recipient must submit the first report within one year of the period of performance end date of the award and then, at a minimum, every five years thereafter.

(3) The reports must be submitted to the Financial Assistance Officer within the period of performance of the award. After the end of the period of performance, reports must be submitted to a designated individual. Each bureau must have a process in place to designate specific individuals to receive, and review and accept the report.

(4) Recipients must use the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, the Real Property Status Report Standard Form (SF) 429&#x2013;A, General Reporting, to report status of land or interests in land under Federal financial assistance awards. Bureaus or offices may request to use an equivalent reporting format. The Director, Office of Grants Management must approve alternate equivalent formats.

(5) Reports must include, at a minimum, sufficient information to demonstrate that all conditions imposed on the land use are being met, and a signed certification to that fact by the recipient of the financial assistance award.

(6) The Financial Assistance Officer must indicate the reporting schedule, including due dates, in the award document. The schedule must conform with the frequency required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For awards issued prior to October 29, 2019, the recipient must contact the program to establish due dates for reports going forward. If there is already a reporting schedule in place, then the recipient and the program shall ensure that the schedule is updated to conform with this part prior to the due date of the next scheduled report.

###### §§ 1402.330-1402.413 [Reserved]

###### § 1402.414 What are the negotiated indirect cost rate deviation policies?

(a) This section establishes DOI policies, procedures, and decision making criteria for using an indirect cost rate that differs from the non-Federal entity's negotiated rate or approved rate for DOI awards. These are established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(3) or (f).

(b) DOI accepts indirect cost rates that have been reduced or removed voluntarily by the proposed recipient of the award, on an award-specific basis.

(c) For all deviations to the Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, including statutory, regulatory, programmatic, and voluntary, the basis of direct costs against which the indirect cost rate is applied must be:

(1) The same base identified in the recipient's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, if the recipient has a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement; or

(2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).

(d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.

(1)In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.

(2)Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.

(3)Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:

(i)Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.

(ii)Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.

(iii)Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.

(4)On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.

(5)In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.

To provide for a fair and impartial review, the AO for the challenged Agency Decision may not serve as the Regional DDO.

###### § 1500.15 Submission of Dispute.

An Affected Entity or its authorized representative may dispute an Agency Decision by electronically submitting a Dispute to the DDO identified in the Agency Decision. In order for the DDO to consider the Dispute, it must satisfy the following requirements:

(a)The DDO must receive the Dispute no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Agency Decision is electronically sent to the Affected Entity. The DDO will dismiss any Dispute received after the 30-day period unless the DDO grants an extension of time to submit the Dispute. The Affected Entity must submit a written request for extension to the DDO before the expiration of the 30-day period. The DDO may grant a one-time extension of up to 30 calendar days when justified by the situation, which may include the unusual complexity of the Dispute or because of exigent circumstances.

(b)The Affected Entity must submit the Dispute electronically via email to the DDO, with a copy to the AO, using the email addresses specified in the Agency Decision within the 30-day period stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c)The Dispute submitted to the DDO must include:

(a)If the Dispute was timely submitted, the notice of acknowledgement may identify any additional information or documentation that is required for a thorough consideration of the Dispute. The notice should provide no more than 30 calendar days for the Affected Entity to provide the requested information. If it is not feasible to identify such information or documentation in the notice the DDO may request it at a later point in time prior to issuance of the Dispute decision.

(b)If the DDO did not receive the Dispute within the required 30-day period, or any extension of it, the DDO will notify the Affected Entity that the Dispute is being dismissed as untimely and the Agency Decision of the AO becomes final. The dismissal of an untimely Dispute constitutes the final agency action. In appropriate circumstances, the DDO may, as a matter of discretion, consider an untimely Dispute if doing so would be in the interests of fairness and equity.

###### § 1500.17 Determination of Dispute.

(a) In determining the merits of the Dispute, the DDO will consider the record related to the Agency Decision, any documentation that the Affected Entity submits with its Dispute, any additional documentation submitted by the Affected Entity in response to the DDO's request under § 1500.16(a), and any other information the DDO determines is relevant to the Dispute provided the DDO gives notice of that information to the Affected Entity. The Affected Entity may not on its own initiative submit any additional documents except in the support of a request for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) The DDO will issue the Dispute decision within 180 calendar days from the date the Dispute is received by the DDO unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented.

The DDO will issue the Dispute decision electronically and advise the Affected Entity of procedures for requesting reconsideration. The DDO's decision will constitute the final agency action unless the Affected Entity electronically petitions the DDO for reconsideration within 15 calendar days of issuance of the DDO Decision. The Affected Entity must include a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds warranting reversal or modification of the DDO decision. In addition, the Affected Entity may submit additional documents that were not previously provided to the DDO.

(c) If a petition for reconsideration is submitted, the DDO's will advise the Affected Entity within 15 calendar days of receipt of the petition whether the DDO Decision will be reconsidered. The DDO will issue this determination electronically. DDO's will only grant a reconsideration petition if the Affected Entity provides relevant and material evidence that was not available to the Affected Entity at the time the Dispute was submitted or to correct a clear and prejudicial error of fact or law. Denial of a petition for reconsideration constitutes final agency action and the DDO will advise the Affected Entity of the reasons for denying the reconsideration in writing.

(d) If the DDO grants a reconsideration petition, the DDO will issue a revised DDO Decision within 30 calendar days of acceptance of the reconsideration petition unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented. The DDO will issue the revised DDO Decision electronically. The revised DDO Decision and any new material considered by the DDO in making the revised DDO Decision will become part of the record of the Dispute. The revised DDO Decision will constitute final agency action.

(e) The DDO may consider untimely filed reconsideration petitions only if necessary, to correct a DDO Decision that is manifestly unfair and inequitable in light of relevant and material evidence that the Affected Entity could not have discovered during the 15-calendar day period for petitioning for reconsideration. This evidence must be submitted within six months of the date of the DDO Decision. The DDO will advise the Affected Entity within 30 days of receipt of an untimely filed reconsideration petition whether the DDO will accept the petition. Denial of an untimely filed reconsideration petition constitutes final agency action.

##### Subpart J - Statutory Disqualification and Reinstatement Under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act

###### § 1532.1100 What does this subpart do?

This subpart explains how the EPA administers section 306 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7606) and section 508 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 U.S.C. 1368), which disqualify persons convicted for certain offenses under those statutes (see § 1532.1105), from eligibility to receive certain contracts, subcontracts, assistance, loans and other benefits (see coverage under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 and subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180). It also explains: the procedures for seeking reinstatement of a person's eligibility under the CAA or CWA; the criteria and standards that apply to EPA's decision-making process; and requirements of award officials and others involved in Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities in carrying out their responsibilities under the CAA and CWA.

###### § 1532.1105 Does this subpart apply to me?

(a) Portions of this subpart apply to you if you are convicted, or likely to be convicted, of any offense under section 7413(c) of the CAA or section 1319(c) of the CWA.

(b) Portions of this subpart apply to you if you are the EPA debarring official, a Federal procurement or nonprocurement award official, a participant in a Federal procurement or nonprocurement program that is precluded from entering into a covered transaction with a person disqualified under the CAA or CWA, or if you are a Federal department or agency anticipating issuing an exception to a person otherwise disqualified under the CAA or CWA.

###### § 1532.1110 How will a CAA or CWA conviction affect my eligibility to participate in Federal contracts, subcontracts, assistance, loans and other benefits?

If you are convicted of any offense described in § 1532.1105, you are automatically disqualified from eligibility to receive any contract, subcontract, assistance, sub-assistance, loan or other nonprocurement benefit or transaction that is prohibited by a Federal department or agency under the Governmentwide debarment and suspension system (i.e. covered transactions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or prohibited awards under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), if you:

(a) Will perform any part of the transaction or award at the facility giving rise to your conviction (called the violating facility); and

(b) You own, lease or supervise the violating facility.

###### § 1532.1115 Can the EPA extend a CAA or CWA disqualification to other facilities?

The CAA specifically authorizes the EPA to extend a CAA disqualification to other facilities that are owned or operated by the convicted person. The EPA also has authority under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to take discretionary suspension and debarment actions on the basis of misconduct leading to a CAA or CWA conviction, or for activities that the EPA debarring official believes were designed to improperly circumvent a CAA or CWA disqualification.

###### § 1532.1120 What is the purpose of CAA or CWA disqualification?

As provided for in Executive Order 11738 (3 CFR, 1973 Comp., p. 799), the purpose of CAA and CWA disqualification is to enforce the Federal Government's policy of undertaking Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities in a manner that improves and enhances environmental quality by promoting effective enforcement of the CAA or CWA.

###### § 1532.1125 How do award officials and others know if I am disqualified?

If you are convicted under these statutes, the EPA enters your name and address and that of the violating facility into the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) as soon as possible after the EPA learns of your conviction. In addition, the EPA enters other information describing the nature of your disqualification. Federal award officials and others who administer Federal programs consult the EPLS before entering into or approving procurement and nonprocurement transactions. Anyone may access the EPLS through the internet, currently at

###### § 1532.1130 How does disqualification under the CAA or CWA differ from a Federal discretionary suspension or debarment action?

(a) CAA and CWA disqualifications are exclusions mandated by statute. In contrast, suspensions and debarments imposed under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, are exclusions imposed at the discretion of Federal suspending or debarring officials. This means that if you are convicted of violating the CAA or CWA provisions described under § 1532.1105, ordinarily your name and that of the violating facility is placed into the EPLS before you receive a confirmation notice of the listing, or have the opportunity to discuss the disqualification with, or seek reinstatement from, the EPA.

(b) CAA or CWA disqualification applies to both the person convicted of the offense, and to the violating facility during performance of an award or covered transaction under the Federal procurement and nonprocurement suspension and debarment system. It is the EPA's policy to carry out CAA and CWA disqualifications in a manner which integrates the disqualifications into the Governmentwide suspension and debarment system. Whenever the EPA determines that the risk presented to Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities on the basis of the misconduct which gives rise to a person's CAA or CWA conviction exceeds the coverage afforded by mandatory disqualification, the EPA may use its discretionary authority to suspend or debar a person under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.

###### § 1532.1135 Does CAA or CWA disqualification mean that I must remain ineligible?

You must remain ineligible until the EPA debarring official certifies that the condition giving rise to your conviction has been corrected. If you desire to have your disqualification terminated, you must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official and support your request with persuasive documentation. For information about the process for reinstatement see §§ 1532.1205 and 1532.1300.

###### § 1532.1140 Can an exception be made to allow me to receive an award even though I may be disqualified?

(a) After consulting with the EPA debarring official, the head of any Federal department or agency (or designee) may exempt any particular award or a class of awards with that department or agency from CAA or CWA disqualification. In the event an exemption is granted, the exemption must:

(1) Be in writing; and

(2) State why the exemption is in the paramount interests of the United States.

(b) In the event an exemption is granted, the exempting department or agency must send a copy of the exemption decision to the EPA debarring official for inclusion in the official record.

###### § 1532.1200 How will I know if I am disqualified under the CAA or CWA?

There may be several ways that you learn about your disqualification. You are legally on notice by the statutes that a criminal conviction the CAA or CWA automatically disqualifies you. As a practical matter, you may learn about your disqualification from your defense counsel, a Federal contract or award official, or from someone else who sees your name in the EPLS. As a courtesy, the EPA will attempt to notify you and the owner, lessor or supervisor of the violating facility that your names have been entered into the EPLS. The EPA will inform you of the procedures for seeking reinstatement and give you the name of a person you can contact to discuss your reinstatement request.

###### § 1532.1205 What procedures must I follow to have my procurement and nonprocurement eligibility reinstated under the CAA or CWA?

(a) You must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official stating what you believe the conditions were that led to your conviction, and how those conditions have been corrected, relieved or addressed. Your request must include documentation sufficient to support all material assertions you make. The debarring official must determine that all the technical and non-technical causes, conditions and consequences of your actions have been sufficiently addressed so that the Government can confidently conduct future business activities with you, and that your future operations will be conducted in compliance with the CAA and CWA.

(b) You may begin the reinstatement process by having informal discussions with the EPA representative named in your notification of listing. Having informal dialogue with that person will make you aware of the EPA concerns that must be addressed. The EPA representative is not required to negotiate conditions for your reinstatement. However, beginning the reinstatement process with informal dialogue increases the chance of achieving a favorable outcome, and avoids unnecessary delay that may result from an incomplete or inadequate reinstatement request. It may also allow you to resolve your disqualification by reaching an agreement with the EPA debarring official under informal procedures. Using your informal option first does not prevent you from submitting a formal reinstatement request with the debarring official at any time.

###### § 1532.1210 Will anyone else provide information to the EPA debarring official concerning my reinstatement request?

If you request reinstatement under § 1532.1205, the EPA debarring official may obtain review and comment on your request by anyone who may have information about, or an official interest in, the matter. For example, the debarring official may consult with the EPA Regional offices, the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies, or state, tribal or local governments. The EPA debarring official will make sure that you have an opportunity to address important allegations or information contained in the administrative record before making a final decision on your request for reinstatement.

###### § 1532.1215 What happens if I disagree with the information provided by others to the EPA debarring official on my reinstatement request?

(a) If your reinstatement request is based on factual information (as opposed to a legal matter or discretionary conclusion) that is different from the information provided by others or otherwise contained in the administrative record, the debarring official will decide whether those facts are genuinely in dispute, and material to making a decision. If so, a fact-finding proceeding will be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 180.830 through 180.840, and the debarring official will consider the findings when making a decision on your reinstatement request.

(b) If the basis for your disagreement with the information contained in the administrative record relates to a legal issue or discretionary conclusion, or is not a genuine dispute over a material fact, you will not have a fact-finding proceeding. However, the debarring official will allow you ample opportunity to support your position for the record and present matters in opposition to your continued disqualification. A summary of any information you provide orally, if not already recorded, should also be submitted to the debarring official in writing to assure that it is preserved for the debarring official's consideration and the administrative record.

###### § 1532.1220 What will the EPA debarring official consider in making a decision on my reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official will consider all information and arguments contained in the administrative record in support of, or in opposition to, your request for reinstatement, including any findings of material fact.

(b) The debarring official will also consider any mitigating or aggravating factors that may relate to your conviction or the circumstances surrounding it, including any of those factors that appear in 2 CFR 180.860 that may apply to your situation.

(c) Finally, if disqualification applies to a business entity, the debarring official will consider any corporate or business attitude, policies, practices and procedures that contributed to the events leading to conviction, or that may have been implemented since the date of the misconduct or conviction. You can obtain any current policy directives issued by the EPA that apply to CAA or CWA disqualification or reinstatement by contacting the Office of the EPA Debarring Official, U.S. EPA, Office of Grants and Debarment (3901R), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.

###### § 1532.1225 When will the EPA debarring official make a decision on my reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official will make a decision regarding your reinstatement request under § 1532.1205(a), when the administrative record is complete, and he or she can determine whether the condition giving rise to the CAA or CWA conviction has been corrected-usually within 45 days of closing the administrative record.

(b) A reinstatement request is not officially before the debarring official while you are having informal discussions under § 1532.1205(b).

###### § 1532.1230 How will the EPA debarring official notify me of the reinstatement decision?

The EPA debarring official will notify you of the reinstatement decision in writing, using the same methods for communicating debarment or suspension action notices under 2 CFR 180.615.

###### § 1532.1300 Can I resolve my eligibility status under terms of an administrative agreement without having to submit a formal reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official may, at any time, resolve your CAA or CWA eligibility status under the terms of an administrative agreement. Ordinarily, the debarring official will not make an offer to you for reinstatement until after the administrative record for decision is complete, or contains enough information to enable him or her to make an informed decision in the matter.

(b) Any resolution of your eligibility status under the CAA or CWA resulting from an administrative agreement must include a certification that the condition giving rise to the conviction has been corrected.

(c) The EPA debarring official may enter into an administrative agreement to resolve CAA or CWA disqualification issues as part of a comprehensive criminal plea, civil or administrative agreement when it is in the best interest of the United States to do so.

###### § 1532.1305 What are the consequences if I mislead the EPA in seeking reinstatement or fail to comply with my administrative agreement?

(a) Any certification of correction issued by the EPA debarring official whether the certification results from a reinstatement decision under §§ 1532.1205(a) and 1532.1230, or from an administrative agreement under §§ 1532.1205(b) and 1532.1300, is conditioned upon the accuracy of the information, representations or assurances made during development of the administrative record.

(b) If the EPA debarring official finds that he or she has certified correction of the condition giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction or violation on the basis of a false, misleading, incomplete or inaccurate information; or if a person fails to comply with material condition of an administrative agreement, the EPA debarring official may take suspension or debarment action against the person(s) responsible for the misinformation or noncompliance with the agreement as appropriate. If anyone provides false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information to EPA in an attempt to obtain reinstatement, the EPA debarring official will refer the matter to the EPA Office of Inspector General for potential criminal or civil action.

###### § 1532.1400 How may I appeal a decision denying my request for reinstatement?

(a) If the EPA debarring official denies your request for reinstatement under the CAA or CWA, you can ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:

(1) You may ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; and/ or

(2) You may request the Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD Director), to review the debarring official's denial within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 1532.1230 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the OGD Director can reverse the debarring official's decision denying reinstatement only where the OGD Director finds that there is a clear error of material fact or law, or where the OGD Director finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing and state the specific findings you believe to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

(c) A review under this section is solely within the discretion of the OGD Director.

(d) The OGD Director must notify you of his or her decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.

###### § 1532.1500 If I am reinstated, when will my name be removed from the EPLS?

If your eligibility for procurement and nonprocurement participation is restored under the CAA or CWA, whether by decision, appeal, or by administrative agreement, the EPA will remove your name and that of the violating facility from the EPLS, generally within 5 working days of your reinstatement.

###### § 1532.1600 What definitions apply specifically to actions under this subpart?

In addition to definitions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that apply to this part as a whole, the following two definitions apply specifically to CAA and CWA disqualifications under this subpart:

(a) Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, state, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a state, or any interstate body.

(b) Violating facility means any building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, location or site of operations that gives rise to a CAA or CWA conviction, and is a location at which or from which a Federal contract, subcontract, loan, assistance award or other covered transactions may be performed. If a site of operations giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction contains or includes more than one building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, or other operational element, the entire location or site of operation is regarded as the violating facility unless otherwise limited by the EPA.

##### § 1532.10 What does this part do?

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the EPA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

##### § 1800.1 Authority.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awards grants and cooperative agreements under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), the National Aeronautics and Space Act. This part 1800 is issued under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), Pub. L. 97&#x2013;258, 96 Stat. 1003 (31 U.S.C. 6301), and 2 CFR part 200.

##### § 1800.2 Purpose.

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

##### § 1800.3 Applicability.

(a) This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by NASA to non-Federal entities, for-profit organization, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101. For supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.

(1) Non-Federal entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.

(2) Foreign organizations and foreign public entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through E of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.

(3) U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR parts 30 and 31 take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E of 2 CFR part 200 for Federal awards to U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations.

(b) Throughout this part, the term “award” refers to both “grant” and “cooperative agreement” unless otherwise indicated.

(c)(1) In general, research with foreign organizations will not be conducted through grants or cooperative agreements, but instead will be accomplished on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. In these cases, NASA enters into agreements undertaking projects of international scientific collaboration. NASA's policy on performing research with foreign organizations on a no-exchange-of-funds basis is set forth at NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) at 48 CFR 1835.016&#x2013;70 and 1835.016&#x2013;72. In rare instances, NASA may enter into an international agreement under which funds will be transferred to a foreign recipient.

(2) Grants or cooperative agreements awarded to foreign organizations are made on an exceptional basis only. Awards require the prior approval of the Headquarters Office of International and Interagency Relations and the Headquarters Office of the General Counsel. Requests to issue awards to foreign organizations are to be coordinated through the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Policy Division.

##### Subpart J - Limited Denial of Participation

###### § 2424.1100 What is a limited denial of participation?

A limited denial of participation excludes a specific person from participating in a specific program, or programs, within a HUD field office's geographic jurisdiction, for a specific period of time. A limited denial of participation is normally issued by a HUD field office, but may be issued by a Headquarters office. The decision to impose a limited denial of participation is discretionary and based on the best interests of the federal government.

###### § 2424.1105 Who may issue a limited denial of participation?

The Secretary designates HUD officials who are authorized to impose a limited denial of participation, affecting any participant and/or their affiliates, except mortgagees approved by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

###### § 2424.1110 When may a HUD official issue a limited denial of participation?

(a) An authorized HUD official may issue a limited denial of participation against a person, based upon adequate evidence of any of the following causes:

(1) Approval of an applicant for insurance would constitute an unsatisfactory risk;

(2) There are irregularities in a person's past performance in a HUD program;

(3) The person has failed to maintain the prerequisites of eligibility to participate in a HUD program;

(4) The person has failed to honor contractual obligations or to proceed in accordance with contract specifications or HUD regulations;

(5) The person has failed to satisfy, upon completion, the requirements of an assistance agreement or contract;

(6) The person has deficiencies in ongoing construction projects;

(7) The person has falsely certified in connection with any HUD program, whether or not the certification was made directly to HUD;

(8) The person has committed any act or omission that would be cause for debarment under 2 CFR 180.800;

(9) The person has violated any law, regulation, or procedure relating to the application for financial assistance, insurance, or guarantee, or to the performance of obligations incurred pursuant to a grant of financial assistance or pursuant to a conditional or final commitment to insure or guarantee;

(10) The person has made or procured to be made any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way an action of the Department; or

(11) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office.

(b) Filing of a criminal Indictment or Information shall constitute adequate evidence for the purpose of limited denial of participation actions. The Indictment or Information need not be based on offenses against HUD.

(c) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office shall constitute adequate evidence for a concurrent limited denial of participation. Where such a concurrent limited denial of participation is imposed, participation may be restricted on the same basis without the need for an additional conference or further hearing.

(d) An affiliate or organizational element may be included in a limited denial of participation solely on the basis of its affiliation, and regardless of its knowledge of or participation in the acts providing cause for the sanction. The burden of proving that a particular affiliate or organizational element is currently responsible and not controlled by the primary sanctioned party (or by an entity that itself is controlled by the primary sanctioned party) is on the affiliate or organizational element.

###### § 2424.1115 When does a limited denial of participation take effect?

A limited denial of participation is effective immediately upon issuance of the notice.

###### § 2424.1120 How long may a limited denial of participation last?

A limited denial of participation may remain in effect up to 12 months.

###### § 2424.1125 How does a limited denial of participation start?

A limited denial of participation is made effective by providing the person, and any specifically named affiliate, with notice:

(a) That the limited denial of participation is being imposed;

(b) Of the cause(s) under § 2424.1110 for the sanction;

(c) Of the potential effect of the sanction, including the length of the sanction and the HUD program(s) and geographic area affected by the sanction;

(d) Of the right to request, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a conference under § 2424.1130; and

(e) Of the right to contest the limited denial of participation under § 2424.1130.

###### § 2424.1130 How may I contest my limited denial of participation?

(a) Within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation, you may request a conference with the official who issued such notice. The conference shall be held within 15 days after the Department's receipt of the request for a conference, unless you waive this time limit. The official or designee who imposed the sanction shall preside. At the conference, you may appear with a representative and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, or within 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials, the official or designee shall, in writing, advise you of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation. If all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is affirmed, the notice of affirmation shall advise you of the opportunity to contest the notice and to request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. You have 30 days after receipt of the notice of affirmation to request this hearing. If the official or designee does not issue a decision within the 20-day period, you may contest the sanction before a Departmental Hearing Officer. Again, you have 30 days from the expiration of the 20-day period to request this hearing. If you request a hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B&#x2013;133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410&#x2013;0500.

(b) You may skip the conference with the official and you may request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. This must also be done within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation. If you opt to have a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B&#x2013;133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410&#x2013;0500. The hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer is more formal than the conference before the sanctioning official described above. The Departmental Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing in accordance with 24 CFR part 26, subpart A. The Departmental Hearing Officer will issue findings of fact and make a recommended decision. The sanctioning official will then make a final decision, as promptly as possible, after the Departmental Hearing Officer's recommended decision is issued. The sanctioning official may reject the recommended decision or any findings of fact, only after specifically determining that the decision or any of the facts are arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

(c) In deciding whether to terminate, modify, or affirm a limited denial of participation, the Departmental official or designee may consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860. The Departmental Hearing Officer may also consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860 in making any recommended decision.

###### § 2424.1135 Do Federal agencies coordinate limited denial of participation actions?

Federal agencies do not coordinate limited denial of participation actions. As stated in § 2424.1100, a limited denial of participation is a HUD-specific action and applies only to HUD activities.

###### § 2424.1140 What is the scope of a limited denial of participation?

The scope of a limited denial of participation is as follows:

(a) A limited denial of participation generally extends only to participation in the program under which the cause arose. A limited denial of participation may, at the discretion of the authorized official, extend to other programs, initiatives, or functions within the jurisdiction of an Assistant Secretary. The authorized official, however, may determine that where the sanction is based on an indictment or conviction, the sanction shall apply to all programs throughout HUD.

(b) For purposes of this subpart, participation includes receipt of any benefit or financial assistance through grants or contractual arrangements; benefits or assistance in the form of loan guarantees or insurance; and awards of procurement contracts.

(c) The sanction may be imposed for a period not to exceed 12 months, and shall be effective within the geographic jurisdiction of the office imposing it, unless the sanction is imposed by an Assistant Secretary or Deputy Assistant Secretary, in which case the sanction may be imposed on either a nationwide or a more restricted basis.

###### § 2424.1145 May HUD impute the conduct of one person to another in a limited denial of participation?

For purposes of determining a limited denial of participation, HUD may impute conduct as follows:

(a)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

(b)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the improper conduct.

(c)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

###### § 2424.1150 What is the effect of a suspension or debarment on a limited denial of participation?

If you have submitted a request for a hearing pursuant to § 2424.1130 of this subpart, and you also receive, pursuant to subpart G or H of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based on the same transaction(s) or the same conduct as the limited denial of participation, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, the following rules shall apply:

(a) During the 30-day period after you receive a notice of proposed debarment or suspension, during which you may elect to contest the debarment under 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, all proceedings in the limited denial of participation, including discovery, are automatically stayed.

(b) If you do not contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with respect to the limited denial of participation, to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation.

(c) If you contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, then:

(1) Those parts of the limited denial of participation and the debarment or suspension based on the same transaction(s) or conduct, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, shall be immediately consolidated before the debarring or suspending official;

(2) Proceedings under the consolidated portions of the limited denial of participation shall be stayed before the hearing officer until the suspending or debarring official makes a determination as to whether the consolidated matters should be referred to a hearing officer. Such a determination must be made within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the suspension or proposed debarment, unless the suspending/debarring official extends the period for good cause.

(i) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, the entire consolidated matter will be referred to the hearing officer hearing the limited denial of participation, for additional proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR 180.750 or 180.845.

(ii) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is no dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, jurisdiction of the hearing officer under 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J, to hear those parts of the limited denial of participation based on the same transaction[s] or conduct as the debarment or suspension, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, will be transferred to the debarring or suspending official, and the hearing officer responsible for hearing the limited denial of participation shall transfer the administrative record to the debarring or suspending official.

(3) The suspending or debarring official shall hear the entire consolidated case under the procedures governing suspensions and debarments, and shall issue a final decision as to both the limited denial of participation and the suspension or debarment.

###### § 2424.1155 What is the effect of a limited denial of participation on a suspension or a debarment?

The imposition of a limited denial of participation does not affect the right of the Department to suspend or debar any person under this part.

###### § 2424.1160 May a limited denial of participation be terminated before the term of the limited denial of participation expires?

If the cause for the limited denial of participation is resolved before the expiration of the 12-month period, the official who imposed the sanction may terminate it.

###### § 2424.1165 How is a limited denial of participation reported?

When a limited denial of participation has been made final, or the period for requesting a conference pursuant to § 2424.1130 has expired without receipt of such a request, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify the Director of the Compliance Division in the Departmental Enforcement Center of the scope of the limited denial of participation.

ACM$ is used to collect award level detail financial information at the time of each payment request submitted by the awardee institution. The Program Income Worksheet is used to collect program income financial information from awardee institutions on an annual basis. ACM$ and the Program Income Worksheet utilize approved government-wide data elements from the FFR for the collection of financial information as provided for in the Uniform Guidance paragraph 505(c) and prescribed in 2 CFR 200.327.

The process of audit resolution includes at a minimum an initial determination, an informal resolution period, and a final determination.

(1)After the conclusion of any comment period for audits provided the recipient/contractor, the responsible DOL official(s) shall make an initial determination on the allowability of questioned costs or activities, administrative or systemic findings, and the corrective actions outlined by the recipient.

(ii)The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, if issued, and shall specifically state those portions of the final determination upon which review is requested. Those portions of the final determination not specified for review shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.

(iii)When no timely request for a hearing is made, the final determination shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor and shall not be subject to further review.

(2)The grantor agency shall establish procedures for the conduct of hearings by the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee.

(3)The head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee, should render a written decision no later than 90 days after the closing of the record. This decision constitutes final action of the Secretary.

(b)(1)(i)Within 21 days of receipt of the grant officer's final determination, the recipient may transmit by certified mail, return receipt requested, a request for hearing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Labor, 800 K Street NW., Suite 400, Washington, DC 20001, with a copy to the grant officer who signed the final determination. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall designate an administrative law judge to hear the appeal.

(ii)The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, if issued, and shall specifically state those portions of the final determination upon which review is requested. Those portions of the final determination not specified for review shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.

(iii)When no timely request for a hearing is made, the final determination shall constitute final action by the Secretary and shall not be subject to further review.

Any exceptions not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived. Thereafter, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the decision of the Secretary, unless the Secretary, within 30 days of such filing, has notified the parties that the case has been accepted for review.

##### § 3474.15 Contracting with faith-based organizations and nondiscrimination.

(a) This section establishes responsibilities that grantees and subgrantees have in selecting contractors to provide direct Federal services under a program of the Department. Grantees and subgrantees must ensure compliance by their subgrantees with the provisions of this section and any implementing regulations or guidance.

(b)(1) A faith-based organization is eligible to contract with grantees and subgrantees, including States, on the same basis as any other private organization, with respect to contracts for which such organizations are eligible and considering any permissible accommodation.

(2) In selecting providers of goods and services, grantees and subgrantees, including States, must not discriminate for or against a private organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, affiliation, or exercise, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3), and must ensure that the award of contracts is free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and is done on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief, or lack thereof. Notices or announcements of award opportunities and notices of award or contracts shall include language substantially similar to that in appendices A and B, respectively, to 34 CFR part 75.

(3) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee in administering Federal financial services from the Department shall require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices where they are not required of non-faith-based organizations. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds shall apply equally to faith-based and non-faith-based organizations. All organizations that participate in Department programs or services, including organizations with religious character or affiliation, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, subject to any required or appropriate religious accommodation, and other applicable requirements governing the conduct of Department-funded activities, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities.

(4) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee shall disqualify faith-based organizations from participating in Department-funded programs or services because such organizations are motivated or influenced by religious faith to provide social services, or because of their religious character or affiliation, or on grounds that discriminate against organizations on the basis of the organizations' religious exercise, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(c)(1) The provisions of 34 CFR 75.532 and 76.532 that apply to a faith-based organization that is a grantee or subgrantee also apply to a faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State.

(2) The requirements referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides goods or services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(d)(1) A private organization that provides direct Federal services under a program of the Department and engages in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services funded by the Department through a contract with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State. Attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the contract must be voluntary.

(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(e)(1) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, will retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance. A faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department does not lose the protections of law.

(2) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may, among other things&#x2014;

(i) Retain religious terms in its name;

(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;

(iii) Use its facilities to provide services without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities;

(iv) Select its board members on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization; and

(v) Include religious references in its mission statement and other chartering or governing documents.

(f) A private organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program goods or services on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program and may require attendance at all activities that are fundamental to the program.

(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e&#x2013;1(a), is not forfeited when the organization contracts with a grantee or subgrantee. An organization qualifying for such an exemption may select its employees on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization.

(h) No grantee or subgrantee receiving funds under any Department program or service shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

(vii) A grantee or subgrantee that has received an exception from the Secretary under 2 CFR 3474.5 and 2 CFR 200.102 (where the Secretary has determined that the grantee's dissemination plan would likely achieve meaningful dissemination equivalent to or greater than the dissemination likely to be achieved through compliance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, or compliance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section would impede the grantee's ability to form the required partnerships necessary to carry out the purpose of the grant); and

(viii) Grantees or subgrantees for which compliance with these requirements would conflict with, or materially undermine the ability to protect or enforce, other intellectual property rights or obligations of the grantee or subgrantee, in existence or under development, including those provided under 15 U.S.C. 1051,18 U.S.C. 1831&#x2013;1839, and 35 U.S.C. 200,

(2) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section do not alter any applicable rights in the grant deliverable available under 17 U.S.C. 106A, 203 or 1202, 15 U.S.C. 1051,or State law.

(e) The license set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not extend to any copyrightable work incorporated in the grant deliverable that is owned by a party other than the grantee or subgrantee, unless the grantee or subgrantee has acquired the right to provide such a license in that work.

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 3485.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part&#x2014;

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210 of this title, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to Part 3485&#x2014;Covered Transactions.

(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.

(4) The contract is to perform services as a third party servicer in connection with a title IV, HEA program.

(c) In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by ED under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the ED nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in Appendix A to Part 3485&#x2014;Covered Transactions).

(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person.

You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or ED grants an exception under § 3485.137.

(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant, you may not continue a title IV, HEA transaction with an excluded person after the effective date of the exclusion unless permitted by 34 CFR 668.26, 682.702, or 668.94, as applicable.

###### § 3485.315 May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or, if ED took the action, an ED deciding official grants an exception under § 3485.137.

(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant&#x2014;

(a) Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to&#x2014;

(2) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

(b) To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 3485.137.

(3) On appeal from a decision debarring a title IV, HEA participant, we issue a final decision after we receive any written materials from the parties.

(4) In addition to the findings and conclusions required by 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, the debarring official, and, on appeal, the Secretary determines whether there is sufficient cause for debarment as explained in § 180.800 of this title.

(4) We use the procedures in § 3485.611 to exclude a title IV, HEA participant excluded by another Federal agency using procedures that did not meet the standards in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) If a title IV, HEA participant is excluded by another agency, we debar, terminate, or suspend the participant&#x2014;as provided under this part, 34 CFR part 668, or 34 CFR part 682, as applicable&#x2014;if that agency followed procedures that gave the excluded party&#x2014;

##### Subpart J [Reserved]

##### § 3485.12 What does this part do?

(a)(1) The Department of Education (the “Department” or “ED”) adopts subparts A through I of the Office of Management and Budget guidance in 2 CFR part 180. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub.

(2) The table of contents for this part contains only those sections in part 3485 that include supplements to the guidance in part 180 and new sections needed to implement the guidance for the Department's programs. In those sections of the OMB guidance that are supplemented, the section in part 3485 includes both the text of the OMB guidance that is not affected by the change and any additional paragraphs that need to be added to the OMB guidance. For example, § 180.220 of this title contains only paragraphs (a) and (b). The text of § 3485.220, which supplements § 180.220 to extend lower-tier transactions to certain transactions below the primary tier, includes both the text of paragraph (a) and (b) of § 180.220 and the text of added paragraph (c).

(3) In those sections in part 180 that do not have paragraph designations and that the Department supplements, the section in this part implementing the OMB guidance designates the undesignated paragraph from part 180 as paragraph (a) and the first supplemental paragraph as paragraph (b). For example, 2 CFR 180.330 includes an undesignated lead in paragraph and two subparagraphs designated (a) and (b). In § 3485.330, the undesignated paragraph in 2 CFR 180.330 is designated paragraph (a) and the two subparagraphs are designated paragraphs (1) and (2). The added paragraphs are designated paragraph (b) and (c).

(b) The authority for all the provisions in 2 CFR part 180 as adopted in this part is listed as follows.

##### § 3485.22 Does this part apply to me?

This part applies to you if you are&#x2014;

(a) A participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of this part and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” in § 180.970 of this title).

(b) A respondent in a suspension or debarment action of the Department.

(c) An ED deciding official; or

(d) An ED officer authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

##### § 3485.32 What policies and procedures must I follow?

A request to review the debarring official's decision to debar you must be made within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the DAP may recommend to the EAC Commissioners that the debarring official's decision be reversed, based on a majority vote of the DAP, only where the DAP finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where DAP finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration.

(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “Debarment Appeal;” state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position. The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 300, Washington, DC 20005.

(c) After the circulation vote of the EAC Commissioners has been certified, either the Commission debarring official or the DAP must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.

(d) [Reserved]

(e) Nothing in this part prohibits the EAC from delegating the appeal review process to another Federal agency through a memorandum of understanding or interagency agreement.
