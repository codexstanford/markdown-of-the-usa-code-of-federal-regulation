### Subchapter B - Law and Order

#### PART 10 - INDIAN COUNTRY DETENTION FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS

##### § 10.1 Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention programs?

Policies and standards are required to ensure that all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal entities that receive Federal funding for the operation, maintenance, design and construction or renovation of detention facilities, community residential, or holding facilities are supporting constitutional rights and are complying with the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act of 1990. Self-governance tribes and tribes with limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. The provision for funding tribes for detention programs under the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Public Law 99&#x2013;570, (25 U.S.C. 2453) requires standards and procedures for such facilities.

##### § 10.2 Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies and standards for detention and holding facilities in Indian country?

The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services who reports to the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, BIA, establishes policies, procedures, and standards for the operations, design, planning, maintenance, renovation, and construction of detention programs in the BIA and by tribal contract under Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93&#x2013;638, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450.

##### § 10.3 Who must follow these policies and standards?

You must follow these minimum policies, standards, and guides if you are part of the BIA or tribal detention or rehabilitation program receiving Federal funding. Self-governance tribes and tribes with limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. Detention officers, guards, cooks and other staff conducting business in the facilities must meet minimum standards of law enforcement personnel as prescribed in 25 CFR part 12, subpart D, “Qualifications and Training Requirements.” Those tribal programs not receiving Federal funding under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93&#x2013;638, as amended) who wish to be accredited are encouraged to use the policies and standards in that part since they have been modified and approved for Indian country.

##### § 10.4 What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?

The risk for human and civil rights violations due to lack of common standards will subject the operation and/or facility to unnecessary exposure to liability. Lack of employee standards, particularly for training and background checks, will increase the risk of misconduct and vicarious liability of the tribes and the Federal government through tort claims. Funding sources for detention programs may become scarce to nonexistent because of contract noncompliance. The tribes' opportunity to receive funding from potential resource sharing agreements with other law enforcement agencies may be damaged because the facility may have to be closed for cause due to violation of the life safety codes.

##### § 10.5 Where can I find the policies and standards for the administration, operation, services, and physical plant/construction of Indian country detention, community residential, and holding facilities?

The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, maintains a manual of policies and procedures called theThe chapter 69 BIAM titled “Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs,” contains the BIA's policies, procedures, and standards for detention and holding programs in Indian country. The standards for the programs within theare in handbook format for easy field reference and use. Copies of the chapter 69and handbooks may be obtained from the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

##### § 10.6 How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being applied uniformly and facilities are properly accredited?

The tribes and BIA programs will use a phased approach to meeting all non-mandatory detention standards and will document progress on uniform reporting. The BIA Office of Law Enforcement Services will conduct periodic operational evaluations for oversight.

##### § 10.7 Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying with the policies and standards?

The BIA has a trained Detention Specialist on the staff of the Office of Law Enforcement Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is available to conduct evaluations and provide technical assistance or guidance in all facets of Indian country detention programs.

##### § 10.8 What minimum records must be kept and reports made at each detention, community residential, or holding facility in Indian country?

The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services, BIA, will develop all necessary requirements for maintaining records, reporting data, and archiving information. These requirements will be published in 69 BIAM, “Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs.”

##### § 10.9 If a person is detained or incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, how would they know what their rights, privileges, safety, protection and expected behavior would be?

When an individual is incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, he/she will be given, or in some cases notified of the availability of, an Inmate Handbook. This book of guidelines describes in detail the inmate's rights, privileges, protection and safety, cleanliness and sanitation, and general health and nutritional standards. The Inmate Handbook describes the emergency evacuation procedures, medical, counseling, rehabilitation services, visitation procedures, and other appropriate information. The Inmate Handbook is published by the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services and maintained by the detention facility administrator at each facility location.

##### § 10.10 What happens if I believe my civil rights have been violated while incarcerated in an Indian country detention or holding facility?

All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported immediately to the Internal Affairs Branch of the Office of Law Enforcement Services. This office will ensure that such allegations are immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice through established procedures. The BIA Internal Affairs Branch may also investigate alleged violations and make recommendations for additional action as necessary. Detailed instructions on the procedure to report violations can be found in the Inmate Handbook.

##### § 10.11 How would someone detained or incarcerated, or their representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

At each detention, community residential, or holding facility located in a tribal jurisdiction where federal funds are used for operations or maintenance programs, the BIA's policies, standards, and procedures will be made available upon request. The Inmate Handbook will be made available to all persons at the time they are incarcerated or detained in a facility. There may be times when this may be delayed due to the physical or mental condition of the person at time of incarceration. In these cases, the Inmate Handbook will be made available when the person is deemed receptive and cognizant by the detention officer in charge. All policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines are available at each facility to the public or by writing to the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

The Director of the Office of Law Enforcement Services for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Director) has been delegated the responsibility for the development of law enforcement and detention policies, standards, and management of all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) criminal investigations, drug enforcement, training, internal affairs, inspection and evaluation, emergency response forces, and other national level Indian country law enforcement initiatives. The Director publishes these policies and standards in law enforcement manuals and handbooks.

BIA may issue law enforcement commissions to other Federal, State, local and tribal full-time certified law enforcement officers to obtain active assistance in enforcing applicable Federal criminal statutes, including Federal hunting and fishing regulations, in Indian country.

(a) BIA will issue commissions to other Federal, State, local and tribal full-time certified law enforcement officers only after the head of the local government or Federal agency completes an agreement with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs asking that BIA issue delegated commissions. The agreement must include language that allows the BIA to evaluate the effectiveness of these special law enforcement commissions and to investigate any allegations of misuse of authority.

(b) Tribal law enforcement officers operating under a BIA contract or compact are not automatically commissioned as Federal officers; however, they may be commissioned on a case-by-case basis.

###### § 12.22 Can Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers enforce tribal laws?

BIA officers will enforce tribal laws only with the permission of the tribe. Local programs are encouraged to make arrangements and agreements with local jurisdictions to facilitate law enforcement objectives.

###### § 12.23 What are the jurisdictional limits in Indian country?

The Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice must maintain and periodically review and update a memorandum of understanding describing the relationship between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the investigation and prosecution of major crimes in Indian country. Any law enforcement programs performing duties under the authority of 25 U.S.C. 2803 must follow the guidelines in the memorandum of understanding and any local United States Attorney's guidelines for the investigation and prosecution of Federal crimes.

##### Subpart D - Qualifications and Training Requirements

###### § 12.31 Are there any minimum employment standards for Indian country law enforcement personnel?

The Director must develop, maintain, and periodically review the qualification standards, including medical qualification standards, for all BIA law enforcement, detention, and conservation enforcement occupational series. The standards will be no less stringent than the minimum standards established by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for these occupational series, and may exceed the OPM standards. BIA standards are available for review at any BIA personnel office. All tribal programs are encouraged to develop standards at least as stringent as those established for BIA officers.

###### § 12.32 Do minimum employment standards include a background investigation?

Law enforcement authority is only entrusted to personnel possessing adequate education and/or experience, training, aptitude, and high moral character. All Indian country law enforcement programs receiving Federal funding and/or authority must ensure that all law enforcement officers successfully complete a thorough background investigation no less stringent than required of a Federal officer performing the same duties. The background investigations of applicants and employees must be adjudicated by trained and qualified security professionals. All background investigations must be documented and available for inspection by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

###### § 12.33 Are Indian country law enforcement officers paid less than other law enforcement officers?

An officer's pay is determined by his/her grade and classification. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs must ensure that all BIA law enforcement officer positions are established at no lower grade level on the Federal scale than similar Federal law enforcement officer positions in other agencies. No BIA position performing commissioned law enforcement duties will be classified in other than the GS 0083, police officer series, for uniformed officers and the GS 1811, criminal investigating series, for criminal investigators.

###### § 12.34 Do minimum salaries and position classifications apply to a tribe that has contracted or compacted law enforcement under self-determination?

Any contract or compact with the BIA to provide law enforcement services for an Indian tribe must require a law enforcement officer to be paid at least the same salary as a BIA officer performing the same duties.

###### § 12.35 Do Indian country law enforcement officers complete any special training?

Law enforcement personnel of any program funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs must not perform law enforcement duties until they have successfully completed a basic law enforcement training course prescribed by the Director. The Director will also prescribe mandatory supplemental and in-service training courses.

###### § 12.36 Does other law enforcement training count?

All requests for evaluation of equivalent training must be submitted to the Indian Police Academy for review, with final determination made by the Director. Requests for a waiver of training requirements to use personnel before completing the required courses of instruction must be submitted to the Director and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In no case will such a waiver allow personnel to be used in any position for more than one year without achieving training standards. Failure to complete basic training requirements will result in removal from a law enforcement position.

##### Subpart E - Records and Information

###### § 12.41 Who keeps statistics for Indian country law enforcement activities?

The Director maintains a criminal justice information system for Indian country. The Director will prescribe the types of data to be collected and the reporting format to be used to collect information and assemble reports on crime reported in Indian country. These reports may be provided to the Department of Justice. Any law enforcement program receiving funding from the BIA must use the same reporting format and submit the same statistical reports to the Office of Law Enforcement Services as prescribed by the Director and as are required of all BIA law enforcement programs.

###### § 12.42 Do Indian country law enforcement programs share information with their own communities or other agencies?

At intervals established by the Director, each BIA criminal investigations program, and any investigations program receiving BIA funds will consult with local tribal leaders and managers of local patrol and detention programs. They will discuss the quality of the local investigations program and offer feedback and technical assistance. There will be no requirement to disclose confidential investigative information or to compromise ongoing investigations during this process.

##### Subpart F - Conduct

###### § 12.51 Must Indian country law enforcement officers follow a code of conduct?

All law enforcement programs receiving Bureau of Indian Affairs funding or commissioning must establish a law enforcement code of conduct which establishes specific guidelines for conduct on and off duty, impartiality, and professional conduct in the performance of duty, and acceptance of gifts or favors. Each officer must acknowledge in writing receiving and understanding of this code of conduct. The acknowledgment will remain on file with the law enforcement program manager as long as the officer is employed there. Training will be conducted on this code of conduct and other ethics issues at least once each year.

###### § 12.52 How do I report misconduct?

The Director will develop and maintain a reporting system that allows any resident of or visitor to Indian country to report officer misconduct. Each law enforcement program in Indian country will maintain instructions on how to register a complaint. An overview of these steps must be posted for public viewing at each law enforcement facility in Indian country.

###### § 12.53 Who investigates officer misconduct?

The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services maintains an internal affairs program that investigates all allegations of misconduct by BIA officers, and any officer receiving funding and/or authority from the BIA. All allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action taken when warranted. Any person having knowledge of officer misconduct must report that information to the officer's supervisor. The supervisor must immediately report allegations to the internal affairs unit. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, the matter may be dealt with locally or it will be investigated by the internal affairs unit. Failure of any BIA employee to report known allegations may be considered misconduct in itself. Citizens may report officer misconduct directly to the internal affairs unit if that is more practical.

###### § 12.54 What can I do if I believe my civil rights have been violated?

All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported immediately to the internal affairs unit. That office will ensure that allegations are immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U. S. Department of Justice through established procedures. BIA's internal affairs unit may also investigate the matter and make recommendations for additional action as necessary.

###### § 12.55 Are there any limits on how much force an officer can use when performing law enforcement duties?

The Director will develop and maintain the use of force policy for all BIA law enforcement personnel, and for programs receiving BIA funding or authority. Training in the use of force, to include non-lethal measures, will be provided annually. All officers will successfully complete a course of instruction in firearms, to include judgement pistol shooting, approved by the Indian Police Academy before carrying a firearm on or off duty.

##### Subpart G - Support Functions

###### § 12.61 Can I be paid for information that helps solve a crime?

The Director can spend money to purchase evidence or information, or to offer a reward, in the investigation of a crime. This is subject to the availability of funds. This authority may be delegated in writing to supervisory criminal investigators within the Office of Law Enforcement Services in the BIA. The Director must develop policies and procedures for the expenditure, control, and audit of these funds before their use.

###### § 12.62 Who decides what uniform an Indian country law enforcement officer can wear and who pays for it?

Each local law enforcement program must establish its own uniform requirements for patrol and detention personnel. Uniformed BIA police officers may be paid an annual uniform allowance not to exceed $400. Local programs may provide uniforms and related equipment to officers in lieu of this payment. All law enforcement officers must also have their official identification on their person at all times when performing law enforcement duties. Uniforms, when worn, will be plainly distinguishable from the uniforms of any non-law enforcement personnel working on the reservation.

###### § 12.63 Do Indian country law enforcement officers perform other duties as well?

Law enforcement commissions will only be issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to persons occupying positions as full-time officers. Bureau of Indian Affairs funded or commissioned criminal investigators will not be responsible for supervising or managing any patrol, detention, or other uniformed police programs.

#### PART 13 - TRIBAL REASSUMPTION OF JURISDICTION OVER CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS

##### Subpart A - Purpose

###### § 13.1 Purpose.

(a) The regulations of this part establish the procedures by which an Indian tribe that occupies a reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10) over which a state asserts any jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588) Pub. L. 83&#x2013;280, or pursuant to any other federal law (including any special federal law applicable only to a tribe or tribes in Oklahoma), may reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings as authorized by the Indian Child Welfare Act, Pub. L. 95&#x2013;608, 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. 1918.

(b) On some reservations there are disputes concerning whether certain federal statutes have subjected Indian child custody proceedings to state jurisdiction or whether any such jurisdiction conferred on a state is exclusive of tribal jurisdiction. Tribes located on those reservations may wish to exercise exclusive jurisdiction or other jurisdiction currently exercised by the state without the necessity of engaging in protracted litigation. The procedures in this part also permit such tribes to secure unquestioned exclusive, concurrent or partial jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters without relinquishing their claim that no Federal statute had ever deprived them of that jurisdiction.

(c) Some tribes may wish to join together in a consortium to establish a single entity that will exercise jurisdiction over all their members located on the reservations of tribes participating in the consortium. These regulations also provide a procedure by which tribes may reassume jurisdiction through such a consortium.

(d) These regulations also provide for limited reassumptions including jurisdiction restricted to cases transferred from state courts under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b) and jurisdiction over limited geographical areas.

(e) Unless the petition for reassumption specifically states otherwise, where a tribe reassumes jurisdiction over the reservation it occupies, any land or community occupied by that tribe which subsequently acquires the status of reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10) also becomes subject to tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.

###### § 13.2 Information collection.

The information collection requirement contained in § 13.11 has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501and assigned clearance number 1076&#x2013;0112. The information is being collected when federally recognized tribes request reassumption of jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. The information will be used to determine if reassumption of jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings is feasible. Response is required to obtain a benefit.

##### Subpart B - Reassumption

###### § 13.11 Contents of reassumption petitions.

(a) Each petition to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings and the accompanying plan shall contain, where available, the following information in sufficient detail to permit the Secretary to determine whether reassumption is feasible:

(1) Full name, address and telephone number of the petitioning tribe or tribes.

(2) A resolution by the tribal governing body supporting the petition and plan. If the territory involved is occupied by more than one tribe and jurisdiction is to be reassumed over all Indians residing in the territory, the governing body of each tribe involved must adopt such a resolution. A tribe that shares territory with another tribe or tribes may reassume jurisdiction only over its own members without obtaining the consent of the other tribe or tribes. Where a group of tribes form a consortium to reassume jurisdiction, the governing body of each participating tribe must submit a resolution.

(3) The proposed date on which jurisdiction would be reassumed.

(4) Estimated total number of members in the petitioning tribe or tribes, together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.

(5) Current criteria for membership in the tribe or tribes.

The description shall include an organization chart and budget for the court. The source and amount of non-tribal funds that will be used to fund the court shall be identified. Funds that will become available only when the tribe reassumes jurisdiction may be included.

(9) Copy of any tribal ordinances or tribal court rules establishing procedures or rules for the exercise of jurisdiction over child custody matters.

(10) Description of child and family support services that will be available to the tribe or tribes when jurisdiction reassumed. Such services include any resource to maintain family stability or provide support for an Indian child in the absence of a family&#x2014;regardless of whether or not they are the type of services traditionally employed by social services agencies. The description shall include not only those resources of the tribe itself, but also any state or federal resources that will continue to be available after reassumption of jurisdiction.

(11) Estimate of the number of child custody cases expected during a year together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.

(12) Copy of any tribal agreements with states, other tribes or non-Indian local governments relating to child custody matters.

(b) If the petition is for jurisdiction other than transferral jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b), the following information shall also be included in the petition and plan:

(1) Citation of the statute or statutes upon which the state has based its assertion of jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.

(2) Clear and definite description of the territory over which jurisdiction will be reassumed together with a statement of the size of the territory in square miles.

(5) Child care services sufficient to meet the needs of most children the tribal court finds must be removed from parental custody are available or will be available at the time of reassumption of jurisdiction; and

(6) The tribe or tribes have established a procedure for clearly identifying persons who will be subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe or tribes upon reassumption of jurisdiction.

The statutory duties of the Secretary to furnish legal advice to any Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes, and to represent such Indian in State courts, in matters affecting a restricted interest owned by such Indian, shall be performed by attorneys on the staff of the Solicitor, under the supervision of the Field Solicitor. Such advice and representation shall be undertaken to the extent that the Field Solicitor in his discretion shall consider necessary to discharge said duties, with due regard to the complexity of the legal action contemplated, the availability of staff attorneys for such purposes, the value and extent of the restricted interests involved, possible conflicts between Indians claiming to be owners of such interests, the preference of such owners concerning legal representation, the financial resources available to such owners, the extent to which such owners require similar legal services in connection with their unrestricted properties, and any other factor appropriate for consideration.

##### § 16.8 Summary distribution of small liquid estates.

Where information, furnished by the Bureau pursuant to § 16.4 or otherwise obtained, reveals that the estate of a deceased Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes contains no restricted land but consists of a restricted interest in funds not exceeding $500 on deposit to the credit of the decedent, the Field Solicitor shall, in the absence of any final decree determining the heirs or legatees of the decedent, prepare and furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of distribution, based on affidavit or other proof of death and heirship or bequest, setting forth the facts of death and heirship or bequest and the amount payable from the estate to each person determined to be an heir or legatee of the decedent. The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or legatee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the order. After final action on any order has been taken by the Field Solicitor, the Bureau shall distribute the funds in the estate of the decedent in accordance with such final action, unless a timely appeal therefrom has been filed in accordance with part 2 of this title.

##### § 16.9 Escheat of estates of decedents.

Where information, furnished by the Bureau pursuant to § 16.4 or otherwise obtained, reveals that the estate of a deceased Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes, who has been dead 5 or more years after having died intestate without heirs, consists of restricted interests in lands or rents or profits therefrom, the Field Solicitor shall, in the absence of any final decree determining that the decedent died without heirs or devisees, prepare and furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of escheat, based on affidavit or other proof of intestate death without heirs, setting forth the restricted interests in lands or rents or profits therefrom which have by escheat vested in the tribe which allotted the lands. The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or devisee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the order. After final action on any order has been taken by the Field Solicitor, the Bureau shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed in the land records of each county within which are located any escheated lands described therein and shall cause the tribe to be credited with any funds in said estate which arose from rents or profits from such lands, unless a timely appeal therefrom has been filed in accordance with part 2 of this title.

(ii) Make appropriate use of accommodations for students with disabilities on all assessments required under this paragraph (a);

(8) Develop, disseminate information on, and promote the use of appropriate accommodations to increase the number of students with significant cognitive disabilities:

(i) Participating in academic instruction and assessments for the grade level in which the student is enrolled; and

(ii) Who are tested based on the BIE's challenging academic standards for the grade level in which the student is enrolled; and

(9) Not preclude a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities who takes an alternate assessment based on alternate academic achievement standards from attempting to complete the requirements for a regular high school diploma.

(b)Subject to the authority and requirements for the IEP team for a child with a disability under section 614(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(VI)(bb)), such team, consistent with the guidelines established by the BIE and required under section 612(a)(16)(C) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(16)(C)) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, will determine when a child with a significant cognitive disability may participate in an alternate assessment aligned with the alternate academic achievement standards.

###### § 30.109 How will the Secretary include English learners in academic content assessments?

(a)English learners must be:

(1) Assessed in a valid and reliable manner; and

(2) Provided appropriate accommodations on assessments administered including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what the students know and can do in academic content areas, until the students have achieved English language proficiency, consistent with standardized BIE-determined exit procedures.

(b)Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, BIE-funded schools must provide for assessments (using tests in English) of reading or language arts of any student who has attended school in the United States for three (3) or more consecutive school years, except that if the BIE-funded school determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that academic assessments in another language or form would likely yield more accurate and reliable information on what the student knows and can do, the BIE-funded school may make a determination to assess the student in the appropriate language other than English for a period that does not exceed two (2) additional consecutive years, provided that the student has not yet reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what the student knows and can do on tests (written in English) of reading or language arts. This requirement does not permit either the BIE or BIE-funded schools to exempt English learners from participating in the BIE's assessment system.

(c)The BIE must:

(1) Disseminate information and resources regarding English learners to, at a minimum, BIE-funded schools, and parents;

(2) Promote the use of accommodations for English learners to ensure that all English learners are able to participate in academic instruction and assessments; and

(3) Provide technical assistance when requested in writing.

(d)With respect to recently arrived English learners who have been enrolled in a school in one of the 50 States in the United States or the District of Columbia for less than twelve (12) months, the BIE may choose to:

(i) The English learner from one administration of the reading or language arts assessment required under § 30.105; and

(ii) The English learner's results on any of the assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) or § 30.110 for the first year of the English learner's enrollment in the school for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system under § 30.111; or

(2) Assess, and report the performance of:

(i) The English learner on the reading or language arts and mathematics assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) in each year of the student's enrollment in such a school; and

(ii) For the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system:

(A) For the first year of the student's enrollment in the school, exclude the results on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;

(B) Include a measure of student growth on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section in the second year of the student's enrollment in the school; and

(C) Include proficiency on the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics described in this paragraph (d) in the third year of the student's enrollment in such a school, and each succeeding year of enrollment.

(e)With respect to a student previously identified as an English learner and for not more than four (4) years after the student ceases to be identified as an English learner, the BIE may include the results of the student's academic content assessments within the English learner subgroup of the subgroups of students as defined in § 30.101 for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system.

###### § 30.110 How will the Secretary ensure BIE-funded schools will provide for annual assessments of English language proficiency for English learners?

(c) The English language proficiency assessment must be aligned with the BIE's English language proficiency standards described in § 30.104(f).

(d) The assessment will be implemented, developed, and used consistent with the requirements of this section.

(e) The assessment will provide coherent and timely information about each student's attainment of the BIE's English language proficiency standards to parents.

(f) If an English learner has a disability that precludes assessment of the student in one or more domains of the English language proficiency assessment such that there are no appropriate accommodations for the affected domain(s) (a non-verbal English learner who because of an identified disability cannot take the speaking portion of the assessment), as determined, on an individualized basis, by the student's IEP team, 504 team, or by the individual or team designated by the BIE-funded school to make these decisions under title II of the ADA, then the BIE must assess the student's English language proficiency based on the remaining domains in which it is possible to assess the student.

(g) The BIE must provide for an alternate English language proficiency assessment for English learners with the most significant cognitive disabilities who cannot participate in the assessment under this paragraph (g) even with appropriate accommodations.

(h) BIE will provide technical assistance, including training teachers on how to administer assessments, in regard to English language proficiency assessments and alternate English language proficiency assessments to BIE-funded schools as requested in writing.

###### § 30.111 How will the Secretary implement requirements for an accountability system?

(a) The Secretary will define accountability system for BIE-funded schools consistent with this section and subpart C of this part, including provisions for a single Bureau-wide accountability system and system of support and improvement activities, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of BIE-funded schools and the students served by BIE-funded schools.

(b) To improve student academic achievement and school success among all elementary and secondary schools within the BIE-funded school system, the Secretary will develop and implement a single, Bureau-wide accountability system that:

(1) Is based on the Bureau's challenging academic standards and academic assessments;

(2) Is informed by ambitious long-term goals and measurements of interim progress;

(3) Includes all the accountability indicators described paragraph (e) of this section;

(4) Takes into account the achievement of all elementary and secondary school students within the BIE-funded school system;

(6) Includes the process that the Bureau will use to ensure effective development and implementation of school support and improvement plans, including evidence-based interventions, to hold all schools within the BIE-funded school system accountable for student academic achievement and school success.

(c) The inclusion of science and tribal civics will be phased into the Secretary's requirements for accountability system starting as a school quality or student success indicator and their continued use in such manner will be revisited as the accountability system is implemented.

(d) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will establish long-term goals and measurements of interim progress that will include, at a minimum, improved academic achievement, as measured by proficiency on the Bureau's annual assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts under § 30.105(b)(5)(i), and high school graduation rates, including the four (4)-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, or at BIE's discretion one or more extended year graduation cohorts, and that will:

(1) Use the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system to meet the goals; and

(2) Take into account, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measurements of academic achievement and high school graduations rates, the improvement necessary to make significant progress in closing Bureau-wide proficiency and graduation rate gaps.

(e) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will include a long-term goal and measurements of interim progress for increases in the percentage of English learner students making progress in achieving English language proficiency as defined by the Secretary and measured by the assessments under § 30.110 within a timeline determined by the Bureau.

(f) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students the Bureau will establish and annually measure the following accountability indicators:

(1) For all schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section, academic achievement:

(i) As measured by proficiency on the annual assessments of mathematics and reading or language arts described in § 30.105(b)(5)(i); and

(ii) At the BIE's discretion, for each high school, growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

(2) For elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools:

(i) A measure of student growth, if determined to be appropriate by the BIE; or

(ii) Another valid and reliable Bureau-wide academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.

(3) For high schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section:

##### § 38.7 Appointment of educators.

(a)Local Bureau school employees shall be appointed only by the school supervisor. Before the local school employee is employed, the school board shall be consulted. An individual's appointment may be finalized only upon receipt of a formal written determination certified by the local school board under such uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board should be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The local school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. The school supervisor may appeal to the ASE, or, where appropriate, to the AEPA, any determination by the local school board concerning an individual's appointment. A written statement of appeal describing the action and the reasons the supervisor believes such action should be overturned must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the action from the local school board. A copy of such statement shall be submitted to the school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, not to exceed 10 calendar days, in writing, to the appeal. After reviewing such written appeal and response, the ASE or AEPA may, for cause, overturn the action of the local school board. The ASE or AEPA must transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the supervisor identifying the reasons for overturning the action within 10 calender days. Failure to act within the 10 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the local school board's determination.

(b)School supervisors may be appointed only by the ASE, except the AEPA shall appoint school supervisors for off-reservation boarding schools and those few other schools supervised by the AEPA. The school board shall be consulted before the school supervisor is employed. The appointment may be finalized upon receipt of a formal written determination certified by the school board under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The school board shall use the same procedure to disapprove an appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, may appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the local school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such an appeal. The Director may reverse the determination for cause set out in writing to the school board. Within 20 calendar days of the school board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE or AEPA identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure by the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the school board's determination.

(c)Appointments to Agency office education positions may be made only by the ASE. The Agency school board shall be consulted before the agency education employee is employed, and the appointment may be finalized upon receipt of a formal, written determination certified by the Agency school board under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The Agency school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE may appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Agency school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such appeal. After reviewing the written appeal and response, the Director may, for cause, overturn the determination of the Agency school board. Within 20 days of the board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure of the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the school's board's determination.

(d)The Bureau shall issue employment contracts each year for individuals employed in contract education positions at the Agency or school levels.

(e)Where a local school board has not been established in accordance with section 1139(7) Pub. L. 95&#x2013;561 with respect to a Bureau school, or where a school board is not operational, and the local school board is required to be given a notice or required to be consulted by statute or these regulations, the official involved shall notify or consult with the Agency school board serving the tribe(s) to which the parents of the Indian children atending that school belong, or, in that absence, the tribal organization(s) of the tribe(s) involved.

(f)Provisional certification or other limited certificates from the State are not considered full certification and only a provisional contract may be issued. There may be circumstances when no individual who has met the full certification or experience requirements is available for a professional position or when a status quo employee who does not meet full certification or experience requirements desires to convert to contract. When this situation exists, a provisional contract may be issued in accordance with the following:

(1) The contract will be made only:

(i) After it is determined that an individual already meeting certification or experience requirements is not available; or

(ii) For conversion of a status quo employee who does not yet meet all established position requirements.

(2) Consultation with the appropriate school board is required prior to the contract.

(3) The contract may be of 12-month or school-term duration.

(4) The employee will be required to make satisfactory progress toward meeting full qualification requirements.

(5) If the employee fails to meet the requirements established under § 38.7(f)(4), the contract will be terminated. Such termination cannot be grieved or appealed.

(g)As provided in section 1131(d)(4), Pub. L. 95&#x2013;561, if an individual who has applied at both the national and local levels is appointed from a local list of applicants, the appointment shall be conditional for 90 days. During that period, the individual's application and background shall be examined to determine if there is a more qualified individual for the position. Removal during this period is not subject to discharge, hearing or grievance procedures.

(h)(1) There may be circumstances where immediate action is necessary and it is impossible to consult with the local school board. When this situation exists short-term contracts may be made by the school supervisor in accordance with the following:

(i) The length of the contract will not exceed 60 days, or the next regularly scheduled school board meeting, whichever comes first.

(ii) If the board meets and does not take action on the individual in question, the short-term contract may be extended for the duration of the school year.

(iii) It shall be the responsibility of the school supervisor to fully inform the local school board of all such short-term contracts. Failure to do so may be cited as reason to discharge the school supervisor if so requested by the board.

(2) The local school board may authorize the school supervisor to make an emergency short-term contract to classroom, dormitory and other positions directly related to the health and safety of students. When this situation exists, short-term contracts may be made in accordance with the following:

(i) If local and agency lists of qualified applicants are exhausted, short-term contracts may be made without regard to qualifications for the position;

(ii) The pay level will be based on the qualifications of the individual employed rather than the requirements of the position, if the qualifications of the individual are lower than required;

(iii) The short-term contract may not exceed the school term and may not be renewed or extended;

(iv) Every 60 days the school supervisor will determine if qualified individuals have been placed on the local or agency lists. If a qualified individual on the list accepts employment, the school supervisor must terminate the emergency appointment at the time the qualified individual is appointed.

(i)There may be circumstances where a specific position is needed for a period of one year or less. Under these conditions a position may be advertised as a temporary position and be filled under a temporary contract. Such contract requires the same school board approval as a school year contract. If required for the completion of the activities specified in the original announcement, the position, may with school board approval be extended for up to one additional year. Temporary contracts may be terminated at any time and this action is not subject to approval or grievance procedures.

(j)Notwithstanding any provision of the Indian preference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any personnel action within the purview of this section respecting an application or employee not entitled to Indian preference if each tribal organization concerned grants, in writing, a waiver of the application of such laws with respect to such personnel action, where such a waiver is in writing deemed to be a necessity by the tribal organization, except that this shall in no way relieve the Bureau of its responsibility to issue timely and adequate announcements and advertisements concerning any such personnel action if it is intended to fill a vacancy (no matter how such vacancy is created). When a waiver is granted, it shall apply only to that particular position and as long as the employee remains in that position.

(k)An educator who voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the school term may not be appointed to another Bureau education position before the beginning of the following school term. An educator will not be deemed to have voluntarily terminated employment if transferred elsewhere with the consent of the local school or Agency boards.

(l)The appropriate school board shall be notified in writing by the school supervisor and/or ASE or AEPA not less than 90 days before the end of the school term whether or not an individual's contract is recommended for renewal.

(1) If the school board disagrees with the school supervisor's or ASE's or AEPA's recommendations, the board will submit a formal, written certification of its determinations to the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA within 25 days. If the board's determinations are not received within the 25 days, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA shall issue the 60 day notification of renewal or nonrenawal to the individual as required under § 38.8.

(2) When the school board submits its determination within the 25 days and determines that a contract will be renewed, or nonrenewed, the appropriate official shall issue the required renewal notice, or nonrenawal, or appeal the determination of the school board to the appropriate official who will make a determination in accordance with the appeal procedure is § 38.7(a) of this part. After the probationary period, if the determination is that the contract will not be renewed, the procedures specified in § 38.8 shall apply.

##### § 38.8 Nonrenewal of contract.

Where the determination is made that an employee's contract shall not be renewed for the following year, the following procedure will apply to those employees who have completed three full continuous school terms of service under consecutive contract appointments and satisfactory performance in the same or comparable education positions.

(a) The employee will be given a written notice of the action and the reasons thereof not less than 60 days before the end of the school term.

(b) The employee will be given 10 calendar days to request an informal hearing before the appropriate official or body. Upon request, the employee may be given official time, not to exceed eight hours, to prepare a written response to the reason(s).

(c) If so requested, an informal hearing shall be held within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request.

(d) The appropriate official or body will render a written determination within seven calendar days after the informal hearing.

(e) The employee has a right to request an administrative review by the ASE or AEPA of the determination within 10 calendar days of that determination. The ASE or AEPA then has 20 calendar days to render a final decision. Where the employee is the supervisor of the school or an agency education employee, any appeal of the ASE or AEPA would be addressed to the Director for a decision. If the Director or ASE's or AEPA's decision overturns the appropriate official or bodies determination, the appropriate official or body will be notified of the reasons in writing. Failure by the Director or ASE or AEPA to act within the 20 days will sustain the determination. This completes the administrative appeal process.

(f) Failure of any of the parties to meet the requirements of the above procedures will serve to negate the particular action sought by the negligent party.

(g) Those employees with less than three full continuous school terms of consecutive contract appointments are serving a probationary period. Nonrenewal of his/her contract will be considered a continuation of the examining process. This action cannot be appealed or grieved.

(h) Independent of the procedures outlined in this section, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA, for applicable positions, shall be required to submit to the ASE or AEPA or appropriate higher authority all nonrenewal actions. Within 60 days, the ASE or AEPA shall review the nonrenewal actions and may overturn the determination of nonrenewal. In the event that the ASE or AEPA makes a decision to overturn the school board determination, the ASE or AEPA shall notify the school board in writing of his/her reasons for doing so.

(i) No more than the substantial standard of evidence shall be required to sustain the nonrenewal.

(j) A procedural error shall not be grounds for overturning a determination of nonrenewal unless the employee shows harmful error in the application of the Agency's procedures in arriving at such a decision. For purposes of this section, “harmful error” means error by the Agency in the application of its procedures which, in the absence or cure of the error, might have caused the Agency to reach a conclusion different than the one reached. The burden is upon the appellant to show that based upon the record as a whole, the error was harmful. i.e., caused substantial harm or prejudice to his/her rights.

(k) Nonrenewal of a contract is not discharge and will not follow the discharge procedures.

##### § 38.9 Discharge of educators.

(a)Educators covered under the provision of this section are excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. 7511 and 4303. In order to provide due process for educators, the Director shall publish in 62 BIAM representative conditions that could result in the discharge of educators for cause and procedures to be followed in discharge cases.

(b)Action to remove educators for inadequate performance will be taken for failure to meet performance standards established under 5 U.S.C. 4302. Performance standards for all educators will include, among others, lack of student achievement. Willful failure to exercise properly assigned supervisory responsibilities by supervisors shall also be cause for discharge.

(c)The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM a description of the budgetary and programmatic conditions that may result in the discharge of educators for other than cause during the school term. The individual's personnel record will clearly reflect that the action taken is based upon budgetary or programmatic restraints and is not a reflection on the employee's performance.

(d)The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM the procedural steps to be followed by school supervisors, ASE's, and AEPA's in discharge for cause cases. These procedures shall provide (among other things) for the following:

(1) The educator to be discharged shall receive a written notice of the proposal, specifying the causes or complaints upon which the proposal is based, not less than 30 calendar days before the discharge. However, this shall not prohibit the exclusion of the individual from the education facility in cases where exclusion is required for the safety of the students or the orderly operation of the facility.

(2) A reasonable time, but not less than 10 calendar days, will be allotted for the individual to make written and/or oral responses to the charge.

(3) An opportunity will be afforded the individual to review the material relied upon to support the charge.

(4) Official time, not to exceed eight hours, will be provided to the individual to prepare a response to the charge.

(5) The educator may elect to have a representative and shall furnish the identity of any representative to the ASE or AEPA. The ASE or AEPA may disallow, as an employee representative, any individual whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or when priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official duties. The terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and 5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) shall govern representation of employees in an exclusive bargaining unit.

(6) The individual has a right to a final decision made by the appropriate level of supervision.

(7) The individual has a right to appeal the final decision and have the merits of the case reviewed by a Departmental official not previously involved in the case. This right includes entitlement to a hearing upon request under procedures in accordance with the requirements of due process under section 1131(e)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 95&#x2013;561.

(e)(1) The appropriate school board shall be notified as soon as possible, but in no case later than 10 calendar days from the date of issue of the notice of intent to discharge.

(2) The appropriate school board, under any uniform procedure as it may adopt, may issue a formal written certification to the school supervisor, ASE, or AEPA either approving or disapproving the discharge before the expiration of the notice period and before actual discharge. Failure to respond before the expiration of the notice period will have the effect of approving the discharge.

(3) The school supervisor initiating a discharge action may appeal the board's determination to the ASE or AEPA within 10 calendar days of receipt of the board's notice. The ASE or AEPA initiating a discharge may appeal the board's determination to the Director within 10 calendar days of receipt of the board's notice. Within 20 calendar days following the receipt of an appeal, the reviewing official may, for good cause, reverse the school board's determination by a notice in writing to the board. Failure to act within 20 calendar days shall have the effect of approving the board's determination.

(f)School boards may recommend in writing to school supervisors, ASE's, or AEPA's, and the Director that individuals in the education program be discharged. These written recommendations may follow any procedures formally established internally by the school board or tribal government. However, the written recommendations must contain specific causes or complaints that may be verified or established by investigation of factual situations. The official receiving a board recommendation for discharge of an individual shall acknowledge the recommendation in writing within 10 calendar days of receipt and proceed with a fact finding investigation. The official who finally disposes of the recommendation shall notify the school board of the disposition in writing within 60 calendar days of initiation of the fact finding investigation.

##### § 38.10 Conditions of employment of educators.

(a)School boards may not direct, control, or interrupt the day-to-day activities of BIA employees carrying out Bureau-operated education programs.

(b)Employee handbook and recruiting guides shall be developed by each local school or agency to provide specific information regarding:

(1) The working and hiring conditions for various tribal jurisdictions and Bureau locations;

(2) The need for all education personnel to adapt to local situations; and

(3) The requirement of all education personnel to comply with and support duly adopted school board policies, including those relating to tribal culture or language.

(c)Employees will be notified 60 calendar days before the end of the school term of the intent to renew or not renew their contract. If an individual's contract is to be renewed, the individual must agree in writing to serve for the next school term. This agreement must be received within 14 calendar days of the date of the notice in order to complete the contract renewal. If this agreement is not received by the fourteenth day, the employee has voluntarily forfeited his or her right to continuing employment. If an individual agrees to serve for the next school term and fails to report for duty at the beginning of the next school term, the contract will be terminated and the individual's future appointment will be subject to the restriction in § 38.7(k) of this part.

(d)An employee accepting a renewal of a school term contract may be appointed to another Federal position during the school recess period without regard to the dual compensation regulations in 5 U.S.C. 5533.

(e)Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) procedures established under 29 CFR part 1613 are applicable to contract employees under this part. It is the policy of the BIA that all employees and applicants for employment shall be treated equally when considered for employment or benefits of employment, regardless of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or mental or physical health (handicap), within the parameters of Indian preference.

(f)The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM procedures for the rapid and equitable resolution of grievances. In locations and for positions covered by an exclusive bargaining agreement, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive avenue of redress for all matters within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure.

(g)The minimum number of times a supervisor shall meet with an employee to discuss performance and suggest improvements shall be once every three months for the educator's first year at a school or Agency, and twice annually thereafter during the school term.

##### § 38.11 Length of the regular school term.

The length of the regular school term shall be at least 180 student instructional days, unless a waiver has been granted under the provisions of 25 CFR 36.61.

##### § 38.12 Leave system for education personnel.

(a)Employees on a full-time school-term contract are authorized the following types of leave:

(1)A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.

(i) The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the official work day.

(ii) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be taken only during the school term. No compensation for or carryover of unused leave is authorized.

(2)Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.

(i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of four hours each biweekly pay period in pay status during the term of the contract; and no precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized.

(ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of separation.

(3)School term employees may receive up to 136 hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. School vacations are scheduled on the annual school calendar during the instructional year and may not be scheduled before the first day of student instruction or after the last day of student instruction. School vacations are not a right of the employee and cannot be paid for or carried over if the employee is required to work during the school vacation time or if the program will not permit school term employees to take such vacation time.

(b)Employees who are on a full-time, year-long contract are authorized the following types of leave:

(1)Absence approved in advance by the supervisor for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of employment&#x2014;120 hours; years 3&#x2013;5 of employment&#x2014;160 hours; 6 or more years&#x2014;200 hours.

Such employees are entitled to receive any changes in compensation attached to the position. Although such employees occupy “education positions” as defined in this part, the terms and conditions of their appointment, status, and entitlements are determined by competitive service regulations and procedures. Under applicable procedures, these employees are eligible for consideration for movement to other positions that are defined as “contract education” positions. Such movement shall change the terms and conditions of their appointment to the terms and conditions of employment established under this part.

(b) If the tribe or school board waives the Indian preference law, the employee loses the early-out retirement eligibility under Pub.

##### § 38.14 Voluntary services.

(a)An ASE or AEPA may, subject to the approval of the local school board concerned, accept voluntary services on behalf of Bureau schools from the private sector, including individuals, groups, or students. Voluntary service shall be for all non-hazardous activities where public services, special projects, or school operations are improved and enhanced. Volunteer service is limited to personal services received without compensation (salary or wages) by the Bureau from individuals, groups, and students. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require Federal employees to work without compensation or to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace Federal employees.

(b)An agreement is a written document, jointly completed by the volunteer, the Bureau school supervisor, and the school board, that outlines the responsibilities of each. In the case of students receiving credit for their work (i.e., student teaching) from an education institution, the agreement will be jointly completed by the student, a representative of the institution, and the Bureau school supervisor. In the case of volunteer groups, the agreement shall be signed by an official of the volunteering organization, the Bureau school supervisor, and the school board and a list of signatures and emergency telephone numbers of all participants shall be attached.

(b)Subtract the average specific Federal share per student (title I part A and IDEA part B) of the total revenue for Bureau-funded elementary and secondary schools for the last school year for which data is available as reported by NCES (15%).

(c)Subtract the administrative cost grant/agency area technical services revenue per student as a percentage of the total revenue (current expenditures) of Bureau-funded schools from the last year data is available.

(d)Subtract the day transportation revenue per student as a percentage of the total revenue (current revenue) Bureau-funded schools for the last school year for which data is available.

(e)Add Johnson O'Malley funding. (See the table, in § 39.805)

###### § 39.805 What was the student unit for instruction value (SUIV) for the school year 1999-2000?

###### § 39.806 How is the SURV calculated?

(a) The SURV is the adjusted national average current expenditures for residential schools (ANACER) of public and private residential schools. This average is determined using data from the Association of Boarding Schools.

(b) Applying the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the SURV for school year 1999&#x2013;2000 was $11,000.

###### § 39.807 How will the Student Unit Value be adjusted annually?

(a) The student unit instructional value (SUIV) and the student unit residential value (SURV) will be adjusted annually to derive the current year Student Unit Value (SUV) by dividing the calculated SUIV and the SURV into two parts and adjusting each one as shown in this section.

(1) The first part consists of 85 percent of the calculated SUIV and the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the personnel cost of living increase of the Department of Defense schools for each year.

(2) The second part consists of 15 percent the calculated SUIV and the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the Consumer Price Index-Urban of the Department of Labor.

(b) If the student unit value amount is not fully funded, the schools will receive their pro rata share using the Indian School Equalization Formula.

###### § 39.808 What definitions apply to this subpart?

means the actual current expenditures for pupils in fall enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools for the last school year for which data is available. These expenditures are adjusted annually to reflect current year expenditures of federally financed schools' cost of day and residential programs.

###### § 81.6 How is a Secretarial election requested?

To request a Secretarial election:

(a) The tribe or petitioner must submit:

(1) A duly adopted tribal resolution, tribal ordinance, other appropriate tribal document requesting the Secretary to call a Secretarial election, or, in the absence of an existing governing document or if authorized or required by the existing governing documents, a petition that has been verified by the Bureau as having the minimum number of required signatures of tribal members; and

###### § 81.8 What happens if a governing Federal statute and this part disagree?

###### § 81.9 Will the Secretary give deference to the Tribe's interpretation of its own documents?

The Secretary will give deference to the tribe's reasonable interpretation of the amendment and adoption articles of the tribe's governing documents.

###### § 81.10 Who may cast a vote in a Secretarial election?

###### § 81.11 May a tribe establish a voting age different from 18 years of age for Secretarial elections?

###### § 81.12 What type of electioneering is allowed before and during Secretarial election?

###### § 81.14 May Secretarial elections be scheduled at the same time as tribal elections?

The Secretarial Election Board will, generally, avoid scheduling Secretarial elections at the same time as tribal elections to avoid confusion. If the Secretarial Election Board decides to schedule a Secretarial election at the same time as a tribal election, the Secretarial Election Board must clearly inform eligible voters of any differences between the tribal election and the Secretarial election and separate ballots must be used for each type of election.

###### § 81.15 How are conflicting proposals to amend a single document handled?

When conflicting proposals to amend a single provision of a tribal governing document or charter provision are submitted, the proposal first received by the Local Bureau Official, if properly submitted as a complete tribal request, must be voted on before any consideration is given other proposals. Other proposals must be considered in order of their receipt if they are resubmitted following final agency action on the first submission. This procedure applies regardless of whether the proposal is a new or revised tribal governing document.

###### § 81.16 Who pays for holding the Secretarial election?

(a) A Secretarial election is a Federal election; therefore, Federal funding will be used to cover costs. The Bureau will pay for the costs, unless the tribe has received funding for this function through contracts or self-governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450f,

(b) Once a tribe removes the requirement for Secretarial approval, all subsequent elections it holds to amend the governing document are tribal elections and the tribe is responsible for the costs of those elections.

###### § 81.17 May a tribe use its funds to pay non-Federal election officials?

A recognized tribal governing body may use tribal funds to compensate non-Federal personnel to respond to the needs of the tribal government in the conduct of the Secretarial election.

###### § 81.18 Who can withdraw a request for a Secretarial election?

The tribe may withdraw the request for Secretarial election in the same manner in which the Secretarial election was requested. The petitioners may withdraw the request for Secretarial election by submitting a new petition, with signatures of at least a majority of the signers of the original petition, seeking withdrawal of the original petition. However, the request for a Secretarial election cannot be withdrawn after the established deadline for voter registration.

##### Subpart D - The Secretarial Election Process under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA)

If the tribe or spokesperson for the petitioners declines or fails for any reason to make the appointment(s) by close of business on the 10th day after the date the notice letter is issued, the Chair of the Secretarial Election Board must appoint the representative(s), who are tribal members, if available, on the 11th day after the notice letter is issued.

###### § 81.29 Why does the Secretarial Election Board compile a Registered Voters List?

###### § 81.34 How are the official ballots prepared?

(a) The Secretarial Election Board must prepare the official ballot so that it is easy for the voters to indicate a choice between no more than two alternatives (adopting or rejecting the proposed language).

###### § 81.38 When are ballots counted?

The ballots will be counted under the supervision of the Secretarial Election Board, after the deadline established for receiving all ballots or closing of the polls, if polling sites are required by the tribe's governing document's amendment or adoption articles.

###### § 81.39 How does the Board determine whether the required percentage of registered voters have cast ballots?

The Secretarial Election Board must count the number of valid ballots and cast spoiled ballots to determine total voter participation. The Board must take the total voter participation and divide it by the total number of Registered Voters. This total is used to determine whether the percentage of Registered Voters who cast votes meets the requirements of the tribe's governing documents or Federal statute that requires at least 30 percent voter participation. For example:

(a) If there were 200 registered voters of which 75 cast valid ballots and 5 cast spoiled ballots for a total of 80 cast ballots (75 + 5 = 80). The percentage of voter participation would be determined as follows:

Total number of votes cast (80) divided by the total number registered voters (200) or 80 &#xF7; 200 = 0.40 or 40 percent voter participation.

(b) This example meets the Federal statutory requirement of at least 30 percent voter participation.

###### § 81.40 What happens if a ballot is spoiled before it is cast?

If a ballot is spoiled before it is cast, this section applies.

(a) The registered voter may return the spoiled ballot to the Secretarial Election Board by mail or in person at the local Bureau office with a request for a new ballot before the election date. The new ballot will be promptly provided to the registered voter. The Secretarial Election Board must retain all “spoiled uncast ballots” for recordkeeping purposes.

(b) If polling sites are required, the voter may return the spoiled ballot to the polling site worker and request a new ballot. Upon receiving the new ballot, the voter must then complete the voting process. The polling site worker will mark the spoiled ballot “spoiled uncast” and record that the ballot has been spoiled. The polling site worker must retain all “spoiled uncast ballots” for recordkeeping purposes.

###### § 81.41 Who certifies the results of the Election?

The Chair and all members of the Secretarial Election Board must be present during the counting of the ballots and must sign the Certificate of Results of Election.

###### § 81.42 Where are the results of the Election posted?

The Secretarial Election Board must post a copy of the Certificate of Results of Election at the local Bureau office, the tribal headquarters, and at other public places listed in the election notice.

###### § 81.43 How are the results of the Election challenged?

Any person who was listed on the Eligible Voters List and who submitted a voter registration form may challenge the results of the Secretarial election. The written challenge, with substantiating evidence, must be received by the Chairman of the Secretarial Election Board within 5 days after the Certificate of Results of Election is posted, not including the day the Certificate of Results of Election is posted. Challenges received after the deadline for filing challenges will not be considered. If the third day falls on a weekend or Federal holiday, the challenge must be received by close of business on the next business day.

The Authorizing Official will take the appropriate steps necessary to provide for a recount or a new Secretarial election.

(b) If all challenges are denied or dismissed, the Authorizing Official will review and make a decision based on the following:

(1) The percentage of total votes cast was at least 30 percent, or other percentages required according to the tribe's governing document's amendment or adoption articles.

(2) The voters rejected or accepted the proposed document or each proposed amendment; and

##### Subpart B - Criteria for Federal Acknowledgment

###### § 83.10 How will the Department evaluate each of the criteria?

(a) The Department will consider a criterion in § 83.11 to be met if the available evidence establishes a reasonable likelihood of the validity of the facts relating to that criterion.

(1) The Department will not require conclusive proof of the facts relating to a criterion in order to consider the criterion met.

(2) The Department will require existence of community and political influence or authority be demonstrated on a substantially continuous basis, but this demonstration does not require meeting these criteria at every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during various years will not in themselves be a cause for denial of acknowledgment under these criteria.

(3) The petitioner may use the same evidence to establish more than one criterion.

(4) Evidence or methodology that the Department found sufficient to satisfy any particular criterion in a previous decision will be sufficient to satisfy the criterion for a present petitioner.

(b) When evaluating a petition, the Department will:

(1) Allow criteria to be met by any suitable evidence, rather than requiring the specific forms of evidence stated in the criteria;

(2) Take into account historical situations and time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited or not available;

(3) Take into account the limitations inherent in demonstrating historical existence of community and political influence or authority;

(4) Require a demonstration that the criteria are met on a substantially continuous basis, meaning without substantial interruption; and

(5) Apply these criteria in context with the history, regional differences, culture, and social organization of the petitioner.

###### § 83.11 What are the criteria for acknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe?

The criteria for acknowledgment as a federally recognized Indian tribe are delineated in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

(a)The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. Evidence that the group's character as an Indian entity has from time to time been denied will not be considered to be conclusive evidence that this criterion has not been met. Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's Indian identity may include one or a combination of the following, as well as other evidence of identification.

(1) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal authorities.

(2) Relationships with State governments based on identification of the group as Indian.

(3) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local government in a relationship based on the group's Indian identity.

(4) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists, historians, and/or other scholars.

(5) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and books.

(6) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships with Indian tribes or with national, regional, or state Indian organizations.

(7) Identification as an Indian entity by the petitioner itself.

(b)The petitioner comprises a distinct community and demonstrates that it existed as a community from 1900 until the present. Distinct community means an entity with consistent interactions and significant social relationships within its membership and whose members are differentiated from and distinct from nonmembers. Distinct community must be understood flexibly in the context of the history, geography, culture, and social organization of the entity. The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion by providing evidence for known adult members or by providing evidence of relationships of a reliable, statistically significant sample of known adult members.

(1) The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion at a given point in time by some combination of two or more of the following forms of evidence or by other evidence to show that a significant and meaningful portion of the petitioner's members constituted a distinct community at a given point in time:

(i) Rates or patterns of known marriages within the entity, or, as may be culturally required, known patterned out-marriages;

(ii) Social relationships connecting individual members;

(iii) Rates or patterns of informal social interaction that exist broadly among the members of the entity;

(iv) Shared or cooperative labor or other economic activity among members;

(v) Strong patterns of discrimination or other social distinctions by non-members;

(vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity;

(vii) Cultural patterns shared among a portion of the entity that are different from those of the non-Indian populations with whom it interacts. These patterns must function as more than a symbolic identification of the group as Indian. They may include, but are not limited to, language, kinship organization or system, religious beliefs or practices, and ceremonies;

(viii) The persistence of a collective identity continuously over a period of more than 50 years, notwithstanding any absence of or changes in name;

(ix) Land set aside by a State for the petitioner, or collective ancestors of the petitioner, that was actively used by the community for that time period;

(x) Children of members from a geographic area were placed in Indian boarding schools or other Indian educational institutions, to the extent that supporting evidence documents the community claimed; or

(xi) A demonstration of political influence under the criterion in § 83.11(c)(1) will be evidence for demonstrating distinct community for that same time period.

(2) The petitioner will be considered to have provided more than sufficient evidence to demonstrate distinct community and political authority under § 83.11(c) at a given point in time if the evidence demonstrates any one of the following:

(i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a geographical area exclusively or almost exclusively composed of members of the entity, and the balance of the entity maintains consistent interaction with some members residing in that area;

(ii) At least 50 percent of the members of the entity were married to other members of the entity;

(iii) At least 50 percent of the entity members maintain distinct cultural patterns such as, but not limited to, language, kinship system, religious beliefs and practices, or ceremonies;

(iv) There are distinct community social institutions encompassing at least 50 percent of the members, such as kinship organizations, formal or informal economic cooperation, or religious organizations; or

(v) The petitioner has met the criterion in § 83.11(c) using evidence described in § 83.11(c)(2).

(c)The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from 1900 until the present. Political influence or authority means the entity uses a council, leadership, internal process, or other mechanism as a means of influencing or controlling the behavior of its members in significant respects, making decisions for the entity which substantially affect its members, and/or representing the entity in dealing with outsiders in matters of consequence. This process is to be understood flexibly in the context of the history, culture, and social organization of the entity.

(1) The petitioner may demonstrate that it meets this criterion by some combination of two or more of the following forms of evidence or by other evidence that the petitioner had political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity:

(i) The entity is able to mobilize significant numbers of members and significant resources from its members for entity purposes.

(ii) Many of the membership consider issues acted upon or actions taken by entity leaders or governing bodies to be of importance.

(iii) There is widespread knowledge, communication, or involvement in political processes by many of the entity's members.

(iv) The entity meets the criterion in § 83.11(b) at greater than or equal to the percentages set forth under § 83.11(b)(2).

(v) There are internal conflicts that show controversy over valued entity goals, properties, policies, processes, or decisions.

(vi) The government of a federally recognized Indian tribe has a significant relationship with the leaders or the governing body of the petitioner.

(vii) Land set aside by a State for petitioner, or collective ancestors of the petitioner, that is actively used for that time period.

(viii) There is a continuous line of entity leaders and a means of selection or acquiescence by a significant number of the entity's members.

(2) The petitioner will be considered to have provided sufficient evidence of political influence or authority at a given point in time if the evidence demonstrates any one of the following:

(i) Entity leaders or other internal mechanisms exist or existed that:

(A) Allocate entity resources such as land, residence rights, and the like on a consistent basis;

(B) Settle disputes between members or subgroups by mediation or other means on a regular basis;

(C) Exert strong influence on the behavior of individual members, such as the establishment or maintenance of norms or the enforcement of sanctions to direct or control behavior; or

(D) Organize or influence economic subsistence activities among the members, including shared or cooperative labor.

(ii) The petitioner has met the requirements in § 83.11(b)(2) at a given time.

(d)The petitioner must provide:

(1) A copy of the entity's present governing document, including its membership criteria; or

(2) In the absence of a governing document, a written statement describing in full its membership criteria and current governing procedures.

(e)The petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe (or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity).

(1) The petitioner satisfies this criterion by demonstrating that the petitioner's members descend from a tribal roll directed by Congress or prepared by the Secretary on a descendancy basis for purposes of distributing claims money, providing allotments, providing a tribal census, or other purposes, unless significant countervailing evidence establishes that the tribal roll is substantively inaccurate; or

(2) If no tribal roll was directed by Congress or prepared by the Secretary, the petitioner satisfies this criterion by demonstrating descent from a historical Indian tribe (or from historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity) with sufficient evidence including, but not limited to, one or a combination of the following identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being descendants of a historical Indian tribe (or of historical Indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity):

(i) Federal, State, or other official records or evidence;

(ii) Church, school, or other similar enrollment records;

(iii) Records created by historians and anthropologists in historical times;

(iv) Affidavits of recognition by tribal elders, leaders, or the tribal governing body with personal knowledge; and

(v) Other records or evidence.

(f)The petitioner's membership is composed principally of persons who are not members of any federally recognized Indian tribe. However, a petitioner may be acknowledged even if its membership is composed principally of persons whose names have appeared on rolls of, or who have been otherwise associated with, a federally recognized Indian tribe, if the petitioner demonstrates that:

(1) It has functioned as a separate politically autonomous community by satisfying criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; and

(2) Its members have provided written confirmation of their membership in the petitioner.

(g)Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of congressional legislation that has expressly terminated or forbidden the Federal relationship. The Department must determine whether the petitioner meets this criterion, and the petitioner is not required to submit evidence to meet it.

###### § 83.12 What are the criteria for a previously federally acknowledged petitioner?

(a) The petitioner may prove it was previously acknowledged as a federally recognized Indian tribe, or is a portion that evolved out of a previously federally recognized Indian tribe, by providing substantial evidence of unambiguous Federal acknowledgment, meaning that the United States Government recognized the petitioner as an Indian tribe eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians with which the United States carried on a relationship at some prior date including, but not limited to, evidence that the petitioner had:

(1) Treaty relations with the United States;

(2) Been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive Order;

(3) Been treated by the Federal Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds; or

(4) Land held for it or its collective ancestors by the United States.

(b) Once the petitioner establishes that it was previously acknowledged, it must demonstrate that it meets:

(1) At present, the Community Criterion; and

(2) Since the time of previous Federal acknowledgment or 1900, whichever is later, the Indian Entity Identification Criterion and Political Authority Criterion.

##### § 101.2 Kinds of loans.

Loans from the Indian Revolving Loan Fund shall be made for purposes which will improve and promote the economic development on Indian reservations.

(a) Loans may be made by the United States to eligible relending organizations for relending to members for economic enterprises and to eligible tribes for relending to members, eligible corporations, cooperative associations, partnerships and subordinate bands and for financing tribal economic enterprises, which will promote the economic development of a reservation and/or the group or members thereon. Loans made by tribes or relending organizations may be for the following purposes:

(1) To individual Indians or Natives, cooperative associations, corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises operated for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the improvement of the economy of a reservation and/or the members thereon.

(2) To individual Indians or Natives for purposes of purchasing, constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by the borrower.

(3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.

(4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds and/or training are not available from grant or scholarship sources, or federal or state training programs.

(b) Direct loans may be made by the United States to eligible tribes, tribal organizations or corporations and tribal cooperative associations without fund restrictions. Direct loans to individual Indians, partnerships, and other non-tribal organizations shall not exceed $350,000. Direct loans from the United States shall be made for the following purposes:

(1) To eligible tribes, individual Indians, Natives, or associations thereof, corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises operated for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the improvement of the economy of a reservation and/or the members thereon.

(2) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of purchasing, constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by the borrower.

(3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.

(4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds and/or training are not available from grants or scholarship sources or federal or state training programs.

(c) Before a United States direct loan is approved, the Commissioner may require the applicants to prepare a market and capacity report on existing or proposed economic enterprises for which financing is requested if the operation involves manufacturing, selling or providing services.

(d) Loans may be made to eligible tribes and Indian organizations for use in attracting industries and economic enterprises, the operation of which will contribute to the economy of a reservation. Tribes and Indian organizations may receive loans from the revolving loan fund for investment in or lending to other organizations regardless of whether they are organizations of Indians. However, not more than 50 percent of the loan made to an Indian organization may be used for the purpose of making a loan to or investing in other organizations. Applications for loans to provide funds for lending to or investing in other organizations already in operation will be accompanied by:

(1) Audited balance sheets and operating statements of the other organization for the immediate three preceding years;

(2) Pro forma operating statement and balance sheets for the succeeding three years reflecting the results of operations after injection of the additional funds;

(3) Names of owners or if a corporation and stock has been issued, names of major stockholders and shares of stock owned by each;

(4) A copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, if incorporated, or other organization papers if not incorporated;

(5) Names of members of the board of directors and officers with a resume of education and experience, and the number of shares of stock owned by each in the corporation;

(6) Purposes for which loan or investment will be used; and

(7) If for manufacturing, selling or providing services, a market and capacity report will be prepared. If a proposed operation is to be established, the information in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this section will be furnished. The Commissioner may require additional information on the other organization, if needed, to adequately evaluate the benefits which the Indian organization will receive and the economic benefits which will accrue to a reservation. If the loan is for relending to another organization, the application must show what security is being offered. If the loan is for investment in another organization, the equity to be obtained must be shown. Copies of all agreements, contracts or other documents to be executed by the Indian organization and the other organization in connection with a loan or investment shall be submitted with the application for a loan and will require Commissioner approval prior to disbursement of loan funds to the Indian organization.

##### § 101.3 Eligible borrowers under United States direct loan program.

(a) Loans may be made from the revolving loan fund to Indians, eligible tribes and relending organizations, and corporations, cooperative associations and partnerships having a form of organization satisfactory to the Commissioner. Loans may be made to applicants only when, in the judgment of the Commissioner, there is a reasonable prospect of repayment. Loans may be made only to an applicant who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions from other sources such as tribal relending programs, banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production Credit Associations, or Federal Land Banks, and is also unable to obtain a guaranteed or insured loan pursuant to title II of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77). In addition, the applicant will be required to have equity equal to 20 percent of the total cost of a new enterprise, or 20 percent of the total cost of expansion of an existing enterprise.

(b) The establishment of a United States direct revolving loan program on a reservation(s) for making direct loans will require the approval of the Commissioner. All requests for establishing a United States direct revolving loan program on a reservation will be accompanied by reasons for need, estimate of financing needs, and other sources of financing available to meet the needs. The Commissioner, in approving a United States direct loan program, may require the preparation and approval of a plan of operation for conducting the program.

(c) If local lending conditions and/or the information in an application for a loan indicate a probability that an applicant may be able to obtain the loan from other sources, the Commissioner, before approving a United States direct loan, will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area who are making loans for similar purposes, stating whether or not they are willing to make a loan to the applicant for the same purposes and amount. If a customary lender will make the loan on reasonable terms and conditions, the Commissioner will not approve a United States direct loan.

##### § 101.4 Applications.

An applicant for a United States direct loan or a loan from a relending organization conducting a relending program under this part will submit an application on a form approved by the Commissioner. Applications shall include the name, current address and telephone number of the applicant(s); current and prior Taxpayer Identification Number&#x2014;Employer Identification Number if a business entity, Social Security Number if an individual; and current employer's name, address, and telephone number; amount of the loan requested; purpose for which loan funds will be used; and security to be offered; period of the loan, assets, liabilities and repayment capacity of the applicant; budgets reflecting income and expenditures of the applicant; and any other information necessary to adequately evaluate the application. The borrower must sign a statement declaring no delinquency on Federal taxes or other Federal debt and borrower's good standing on dealings in procurement or non-procurement with the Federal Government. The Bureau will obtain a current credit bureau report and prescribe procedures to be used in handling loan proceeds. In addition, applications for loans to finance economic enterprises already in operation will be accompanied by:

(a) A copy of operating statements, balance sheets and budgets for the prior two operating years or applicable period thereof preceding submittal of the application;

(b) Current budget, balance sheet and operating statements; and

(c) Pro forma budgets operating statements and balance sheets showing the estimated results for operating the enterprise for two years after injection of the loan funds into the operation.

##### § 101.5 Approval of loans.

(a) Loan agreements, including those used by relending organizations in operating a relending program, must be executed on a form approved by the Commissioner. On direct United States loans, the Commissioner will approve the loan by issuing a commitment order covering the terms and conditions for making the loan.

(b) Applications for loans from relending organizations must be approved, if a tribe, by the governing body or designated committee, or other approving committee or body authorized to act on credit matters for a relending organization, before the Commissioner takes action on the application. This designated governing body of the tribe or committee must be authorized to act on behalf of the relending organization as evidenced in the organization's declaration of policy and plan of operation.

(c) Corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations organized for the purpose of establishing, acquiring, expanding, and operating an economic enterprise shall be organized pursuant to federal, state or tribal law. The form of organization shall be acceptable to the Commissioner. Economic enterprises which are or will be operated on a reservation(s) must comply with the requirements of applicable rules, resolutions and ordinances enacted by the governing body of the tribe.

##### § 101.6 Modification of loans.

(a)Any modification of the terms and provisions of a United States direct loan agreement must be requested in writing by the borrower and approved by the Commissioner. The borrower will submit the request for modification and will indicate the section(s) of the loan agreement to be modified together with a justification for the modification. Requests for modifications of loan agreements will include an agreement to abide by the provisions of the regulations in this part and future amendments and modifications thereof. In addition, a current credit bureau report, obtained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will be made a part of the modification request.

(b)Any modification of the terms and provisions of a loan agreement of a borrower from an organization conducting a relending program must be in writing, agreed to by the borrower, and must be approved by the body authorized to act on loans and modifications thereof as provided in an approved declaration of policy and plan of operation or other plan. If a request for modification of a loan has been disapproved by the body authorized to act on the request, the rejected borrower may request the Commissioner to make a direct loan from the revolving loan fund if the Commissioner determines that the rejection is unwarranted.

##### § 101.7 Management and technical assistance.

Prior to and concurrent with the approval of a United States direct loan to finance an economic enterprise, the Commissioner will assure under title V of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 that competent management and technical assistance is available to the loan applicant for preparation of the application and/or administration of funds loaned consistent with the nature of the enterprise proposed to be or in fact funded by the loan. Assistance may be provided by available Bureau of Indian Affairs staff, the tribe or other sources which the Commissioner considers competent to provide needed assistance. Contracting for management and technical assistance may be used only when adequate assistance is not available without additional cost. Contracts for providing borrowers with competent management and technical assistance shall be in accordance with applicable Federal Procurement Regulations and the Buy Indian Act of April 30, 1908, chapter 153 (35 Stat. 71), as amended June 25, 1910, chapter 431, section 25 (36 Stat. 861).

##### § 101.8 Environmental and Flood Disaster Acts.

Loans will not be approved until there is assurance of compliance with any applicable provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93&#x2013;234, 87 Stat. 975), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&#x2013;190), (42 U.S.C. 4321) and Executive Order 11514.

##### § 101.9 Preservation of historical and archeological data.

(a) On United States direct loans from the revolving loan fund and modifications thereof to provide additional loan funds which will involve excavations, road or street construction, land development or disturbance of land on known or reported historical or archeological sites, the Commissioner will take or require appropriate action to assure compliance with the applicable provisions of the Act of June 27, 1960 (74 Stat. 220; (16 U.S.C. 469)), as amended by the Act of May 24, 1974 (Pub. L. 93&#x2013;291, 88 Stat. 174).

(b) On loans made by relending organizations conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds, the body authorized to act on loan applications and modifications thereof will, at the time of taking action on a loan or request for modification, inform the applicant of the applicability of this Act to the loan and advise the Commissioner of compliance or the need to obtain compliance.

##### § 101.10 Federal Reserve Regulation Z and Fair Credit Reporting Act.

(a) United States direct loans and loans made by a relending organization are subject to the provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation Z (Truth In Lending, 12 CFR part 226; Pub. L. 91&#x2013;508, 84 Stat. 1127). Economic enterprises which extend credit and require payment of finance charges on unpaid balances will determine the applicability of Regulation Z and comply with the requirements thereof. The Commissioner will issue any necessary instructions to assure compliance with Regulation Z on United States direct loans.

(b) Relending organizations, through their committee or other body authorized to act on loan matters on its behalf, will assure compliance with the applicable provisions of this Act.

(c) The Commissioner will require adherence to the provisions and requirements of title VI of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in making United States direct loans. Relending organizations, through the body authorized to act on credit matters, will require compliance with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

##### § 101.11 Interest.

(a) The interest to be charged on loans by the United States shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with section 104, title I, of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-262, 88 Stat. 77). The interest rate shall be determined monthly and shall be effective on advances made on loans during the current calendar month. The interest rate shall be stated in the promissory note(s) executed by the borrower(s) evidencing the advance(s).

(b) Additional charges to cover loan administration costs, including credit reports, may be charged to borrowers.

(c) Education loans may provide for deferral of interest while the borrower is in school full time or in the military service.

(d) The interest rate on loans made by relending organizations which are conducting relending programs shall not be less than the rate the organization pays on its loan(s) from the United States. Relending organizations which adopt and follow the same procedure in calculating interest on educational loans as is followed on educational loans made by the United States, will not be charged interest on loans from the United States on the amount outstanding on educational loans during the period the organization is not charging its borrowers interest.

(e) Interest rates on loan advances made by the United States as shown on promissory notes dated before April 12, 1974, will remain in effect until the loan is paid in full, refinanced, or modified to extend the repayment terms. Unless otherwise specifically provided in a loan contract, the interest rate on advances made after April 12, 1974, will be at a rate determined pursuant to section 104 of title I of the Indian Financing Act of 1974. The interest rate on loans for expert assistance will be at a rate established in § 101.25 herein.

##### § 101.12 Records and reports.

Loan agreements between the United States and tribes, corporations, partnerships, cooperative associations and individual Indians for financing economic enterprises, and to relending organizations, will require that borrowers establish and maintain accounting and operating records that are satisfactory to the Commissioner and submit written reports as required by the Commissioner. The records, accounts, and loan files shall be available for examination and audit by the Commissioner at any reasonable time. Unless an exception is approved by the Commissioner, borrowers will be required to have an annual audit made of the records of relending programs and economic enterprises financed with revolving loan funds, by a certified public accountant or a firm of certified public accountants or other qualified public accountants satisfactory to the Commissioner.

##### § 101.13 Security.

(a) United States direct loans shall be secured by such security as the Commissioner may require. A lack of security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. Loans made by relending organizations conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds will require borrowers to give security for loans, if available, but the absence of security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. The declaration of policy and plan of operation of relending organizations conducting relending programs will include provisions covering the type and amount of security to be taken to secure loans made.

(b) Land purchased by an individual Indian with the proceeds of a loan and land already held in trust or restricted status by the individual Indian may be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance with 25 CFR 152.34 and the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; (25 U.S.C. 483a)). Mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land will include only an acreage of the borrower's land which the Commissioner determines is necessary to protect the loan in case of default. On proposed foreclosures which involve the sale of individually held trust or restricted land given as security for a loan, the tribe of the reservation on which the land is located will be notified in writing at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated date of sale. Land purchased by a tribe with the proceeds of a loan from the revolving loan fund with title taken in a trust or restricted status, and land already held in a trust or restricted status by a tribe may not be mortgaged as security for a loan.

(1) Title to any land purchased by a tribe or by an individual Indian with revolving loan funds may be taken in trust or restricted status unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a reservation or a tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary. Title to any land purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is outside the boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area may be taken in trust if the purchaser was the owner of trust or restricted interests in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title shall be taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on alienation, control, or use.

(c) Mortgages of leasehold interests in land held in trust or restricted status by an individual Indian, may be taken for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development and improvement of the leased premises when permitted in the lease or lease modification agreement. Such mortgages must be approved by the lessor and Commissioner. (70 Stat. 62, (25 U.S.C. 483a)).

(d) Individuals may give assignments of income from trust property as security for loans. Tribes may give assignments of trust income as security for loans provided that the assignment shall be specific as to the source(s) of income being assigned. All assignments of trust income require approval by the Commissioner before becoming effective.

(e) Chattels may be given as security for a loan. A mortgage on chattels, the title to which is known to be in trust, requires Commissioner approval. Non-trust chattels may be mortgaged without approval of any federal official.

(f) Crops grown on lands held in trust or restricted status for the benefit of an individual Indian may be given as security for a loan when approved by the Commissioner. Crops grown on leased, trust or restricted land may be given as security for a loan when permitted by the provisions of a lease or when the owner gives written consent. Approval of the lien document by the Commissioner is required. Crops grown on trust or restricted land held by a tribe which has been assigned to an individual for use may be given as security for a loan, provided the terms of the assignment permit the assignee to give the crops as security for a loan or the tribe's governing body specifically gives consent. The lien document requires Commissioner approval. Crops grown on non-trust or non-restricted land may be mortgaged without the approval of any federal official.

(g) Title to any personal property purchased with a loan shall be taken in the name of the purchaser and mortgaged to secure the loan unless the loan is otherwise adequately secured. Tribes must adhere to the provisions of their constitutions and bylaws, corporate charters, or other organizational documents when mortgaging tribal property and assigning trust income as security for loans.

(h) Relending organizations receiving a loan from the United States for relending shall be required to assign to the United States as security for the loan all securities acquired in connection with loans made to its members, sub-organizations, or associations from such funds, unless the Commissioner determines that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise reasonably assured. Funds advanced to finance a tribal economic enterprise shall be secured by an assignment of net income and net assets of the economic enterprise, unless the Commissioner determines that it is not feasible to require an assignment or that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise reasonably assured.

(i) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or recorded in accordance with applicable state or federal laws except for those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages on documented vessels will be filed at the customs house designated as the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

##### § 101.14 Maturity.

The maturity of any United States direct loan shall not exceed thirty years. Loans made will be scheduled for repayment at the earliest possible date consistent with the purpose of the loan and the repayment capacity of the borrower.

##### § 101.15 Penalties on default.

Unless otherwise provided in the loan agreement between the United States and a borrower, failure on the part of a borrower to conform to the terms of the loan agreement will be deemed grounds for the taking of any one or all of the following steps by the Commissioner:

(a) Discontinue any further advance of funds contemplated by the loan agreement.

(b) Take possession of any or all collateral given as security and in the case of individuals, corporation, partnerships or cooperative associations, the property purchased with the borrowed funds.

(c) Prosecute legal action against the borrower or against officers of corporations, tribes, bands, credit associations, cooperative associations, and other organizations.

(d) Declare the entire amount advanced immediately due and payable.

(e) Prevent further disbursement of credit funds under the control of the borrower.

(f) Withdraw any unobligated funds from the borrower.

(g) Require relending organizations conducting a relending program to apply all collections on loans to liquidate the debt to the United States.

(h) Take possession of the assets of a relending organization conducting a relending program and exercise or arrange to exercise its powers until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its repayment of the revolving loan and compliance with the provisions of the terms of the loan agreement.

(i) Liquidate, operate or arrange for the operation of economic enterprises financed with revolving loans made to individuals, tribes, corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations until the indebtedness is paid or until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its repayment and compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.

(j) Report the name and account information of a delinquent borrower to a credit bureau.

(k) Assess additional interest and penalty charges for the period of time that payment is not made.

(l) Assess charges to cover additional administrative costs incurred by the Government to service the account.

(m) Offset amounts owed the borrower under other Federal programs including other programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

(n) Refer the account to a private collection agency to collect the amount due.

(o) Refer the account to the U.S. Department of Justice for collection by litigation.

(p) If the borrower is a current or retired Federal employee, take action to offset the borrower's salary or civil service retirement benefits.

(q) Refer the debt to the Internal Revenue Service for offset against any amount owed the borrower as an income tax refund.

(r) Report any written-off debt to the Internal Revenue Service as taxable income to the borrower.

(s) Recommend suspension or debarment from conducting further business with the Federal Government.

##### § 101.16 Default on loans made by relending organizations.

Relending organizations conducting relending programs using revolving loan funds will follow prudent lending practices in making and servicing loans and take appropriate actions to protect their interests in the security given to secure repayment of loans. Declarations of policy and plans of operation shall include procedures which will be followed in acting to correct a default, such as modification of loan agreement or foreclosure and liquidation of security. Relending organizations employing a general counsel will refer legal questions on foreclosure procedures and sale of security to their counsel.

##### § 101.17 Uncollectable loans made by the United States.

If the Secretary determines that a United States direct loan is uncollectable in whole or in part or is collectable only at an unreasonable cost, or when such action would be in the best interest of the United States, the Secretary may cancel, adjust, compromise, or reduce the amount of any loan made from the revolving loan fund. The Commissioner may adjust, compromise, subordinate, or modify the terms of any mortgage, lease, assignment, contract, agreement, or other document taken as security for loans. The cancellation of all or part of a loan shall become effective when signed by the Secretary.

##### § 101.18 Uncollectible loans made by relending organizations.

(a) Relending organizations conducting relending programs using revolving loan funds may, when approved by the Commissioner, chargeoff as uncollectible all or part of the balance of principal and interest owing on loans which are considered to be uncollectible. Usually a chargeoff includes both principal and interest and provides for cessation of interest accruals on the principal balance owing as of the date of the chargeoff.

(b) Action to chargeoff a loan will be in the form of a resolution enacted by the committee or body authorized and responsible for actions on loan matters for the relending organization. Before action is taken to chargeoff a loan as uncollectible, the lender will make an effort, to the extent feasible, to liquidate the security given for a loan and apply the net proceeds as a repayment on the balance of principal and interest owed. The chargeoff of a loan by a relending organization as uncollectible will not reduce the principal balance owed to the United States. A chargeoff will not release the borrower of the obligation or the responsibility to make payments when his or her financial situation will permit. Chargeoff action will not release the lender of responsibility to continue its efforts to collect the loan.

##### § 101.19 Assignment of loans.

A borrower of a direct loan from the United States may not assign the loan agreement or any interest in it to a third party without the consent of the Commissioner. Relending organizations which are conducting relending programs may not assign the loan agreements of borrowers, or any interest therein, to third parties without the approval of the Commissioner and the borrower.

##### § 101.20 Relending by borrower.

(a) A relending organization may reloan funds loaned to it by the United States with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may authorize such lenders to approve applications for particular types of loans up to a specified amount.

(b) Loans shall be secured by such securities as the lender and the Commissioner may require. With the Commissioner's approval, mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land, leasehold interests, chattels, crops grown on trust or restricted land, and assignments of trust income may all be taken as security for loans.

(c) Title to personal property purchased with loans received from relending organizations using revolving loan funds in its relending program shall be taken in the name of the borrower.

(d) The term of a loan made by a relending organization conducting a relending program shall not extend beyond the maturity date of its loan from the United States, unless an exception is approved by the Commissioner and the organization has funds available from which to make scheduled repayment on its loan from the United States. Loans made will be scheduled for repayment at the earliest possible date consistent with the purpose for which a loan is made and the indicated repayment capacity of the borrower.

(e) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or recorded in accordance with federal or state law except those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages on documented vessels will be filed at the custom house designated as the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

##### § 101.21 Repayments on United States direct loans.

Repayments on United States direct loans shall be made to the authorized collection officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who shall issue an official receipt for the repayment and deposit the collection into the revolving loan fund. Collections will first be applied to pay interest to date of payment and the balance applied on the principal installment due. Collections on loans made by relending organizations which have been declared in default in which the Commissioner has taken control of the assets of the program (including loans made with balances owing) will be made to an authorized collection officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who shall issue a receipt to the payor and deposit the collection in the United States revolving loan fund. The relending organization's loan from the United States will be credited with the amounts collected from its borrowers, with the collections applied first on interest accrued and the balance applied to the principal. Payments on United States direct loans may be made in advance of due dates without penalty.

##### § 101.22 Repayments on loans made by relending organizations.

Repayments on loans made by a relending organization conducting a relending program will be made to the officers of the lending organization or individuals designated and authorized in a declaration of policy and plan of operation. Collections on loans and other income to a relending program will be deposited in the lender's revolving loan account as designated in a declaration of policy and plan of operation. Collections on loans will be first applied to pay interest to date of payment with the balance applied to the principal.

##### § 101.23 Approval of articles of association and bylaws.

Articles of association and bylaws of relending organizations and cooperative associations require approval of the Commissioner if they make application for a revolving credit loan.

##### § 101.24 Loans for expert assistance for preparation and trial of Indian claims.

(a) Loans may be made to Indian tribes, bands and other identifiable groups of Indians from funds authorized and appropriated under the provisions of section 1 of the Act of November 4, 1963 (Pub. L. 88&#x2013;168, 77 Stat. 301; 25 U.S.C. 70n&#x2013;1), as amended by the Act of September 19, 1966 (Pub. L. 89&#x2013;592, 80 Stat. 814) and section 2 of the Act of May 24, 1973 (Pub. L. 93&#x2013;37, 87 Stat. 73). Loan proceeds may only be used for the employment of expert assistance, other than the assistance of counsel, for the preparation and trial of claims pending before the Indian Claims Commission. Applications for loans will be submitted on forms approved by the Commissioner and shall include a justification of the need for a loan. The justification shall include a statement from the applicant's claims attorney regarding the need for a loan. The application will be accompanied by a statement signed by an authorized officer of the applicant certifying that the applicant does not have adequate funds available to obtain and pay for the expert assistance needed. The Superintendent and the Area Director will attest to the accuracy of the statement or point out any inaccuracies. Loans will be approved by issuance of a commitment order by the Commissioner.

(b) No loan shall be approved if the applicant has funds available on deposit in the United States Treasury or elsewhere in an amount adequate to obtain the expert assistance needed or if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the fees to be paid the experts are unreasonable on the basis of the services to be performed by them.

(c) Contracts for the employment of experts are subject to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 81 and require approval by the Commissioner.

(d) Vouchers or claims submitted by experts for payment for services rendered and reimbursement for expenses will be in accordance with the provisions of the expert assistance contract and shall be sufficiently detailed and itemized to permit an audit to determine that the amounts are in accordance with the contract. Vouchers or claims shall be reviewed by the borrower's claims attorney who will certify on the last page of the voucher or by attachment thereto, that the services have been rendered and payment is due the expert and that expenses and charges for work performed are in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

(e) Requests for advances under the loan agreement shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the borrower certifying that the borrower does not have adequate funds available from its own financial resources with which to pay the expert.

#### PART 103 - LOAN GUARANTY, INSURANCE, AND INTEREST SUBSIDY

##### Subpart A - General Provisions

###### § 103.1 What does this part do?

This part explains how to obtain and use a BIA loan guaranty or loan insurance agreement under the Program, and who may do so. It also describes how to obtain and use interest subsidy payments under the Program, and who may do so.

###### § 103.2 Who does the Program help?

The purpose of the Program is to encourage eligible borrowers to develop viable Indian businesses through conventional lender financing. The direct function of the Program is to help lenders reduce excessive risks on loans they make. That function in turn helps borrowers secure conventional financing that might otherwise be unavailable.

###### § 103.3 Who administers the Program?

Authority for administering the Program ultimately rests with the Secretary, who may exercise that authority directly at any time. Absent a direct exercise of authority, however, the Secretary delegates Program authority to BIA officials through the U.S. Department of Interior Departmental Manual. A lender should submit all applications and correspondence to the BIA office serving the borrower's location.

###### § 103.4 What kinds of loans will BIA guarantee or insure?

In general, BIA may guarantee or insure any loan made by an eligible lender to an eligible borrower to conduct a lawful business organized for profit. There are several important exceptions:

(a) The business must contribute to the economy of an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA;

(b) The borrower may not use the loan for relending purposes;

(c) If any portion of the loan is used to refinance an existing loan, the borrower must be current on the existing loan; and

(d) BIA may not guarantee or insure a loan if it believes the lender would be willing to extend the requested financing without a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage.

###### § 103.5 What size loan will BIA guarantee or insure?

BIA can guarantee or insure a loan or combination of loans of up to $500,000 for an individual Indian, or more for an acceptable Indian business entity, Tribe, or tribal enterprise involving two or more persons. No individual Indian may have an outstanding principal balance of more than $500,000 in guaranteed or insured loans at any time. BIA can limit the size of loans it will guarantee or insure, depending on the resources BIA has available.

###### § 103.6 To what extent will BIA guarantee or insure a loan?

(a) BIA can guarantee up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest due on a loan.

(b) BIA can insure up to the lesser of:

(1) 90 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest due on a loan; or

(2) 15 percent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all loans the lender has insured under the Program as of the date the lender makes a claim under its insurance coverage.

(c) BIA's guaranty certificate or loan insurance agreement should reflect the lowest guaranty or insurance percentage rate that satisfies the lender's risk management requirements.

(d) Absent exceptional circumstances, BIA will allow no more than:

(1) Two simultaneous guarantees under the Program covering outstanding loans from the same lender to the same borrower; or

(2) One loan guaranty under the Program when the lender simultaneously has one or more outstanding loans insured under the Program to the same borrower.

###### § 103.7 Must the borrower have equity in the business being financed?

The borrower must be projected to have at least 20 percent equity in the business being financed, immediately after the loan is funded. If a substantial portion of the loan is for construction or renovation, the borrower's equity may be calculated based upon the reasonable estimated value of the borrower's assets after completion of the construction or renovation.

###### § 103.8 Is there any cost for a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage?

BIA charges the lender a premium for a guaranty or insurance coverage.

(a) The premium is:

(1) Two percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA guarantees; or

(2) One percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA insures, without considering the 15 percent aggregate outstanding principal limitation on the lender's insured loans.

(b) Lenders may pass the cost of the premium on to the borrower, either by charging a one-time fee or by adding the cost to the principal amount of the borrower's loan. Adding the premium to the principal amount of the loan will not make any further premium due. BIA will guarantee or insure the additional principal to the same extent as the original approved principal amount.

##### Subpart B - How a Lender Obtains a Loan Guaranty or Insurance Coverage

###### § 103.9 Who applies to BIA under the Program?

The lender is responsible for determining whether it will require a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage, based upon the loan application it receives from an eligible borrower. If the lender requires a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender is responsible for completing and submitting a guaranty application or complying with a loan insurance agreement under the Program.

###### § 103.10 What lenders are eligible under the Program?

(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a lender is eligible under the Program, and may be considered for BIA approval, if the lender is:

(1) Regularly engaged in the business of making loans;

(2) Capable of evaluating and servicing loans in accordance with reasonable and prudent industry standards; and

(3) Otherwise reasonably acceptable to BIA.

(b) The following lenders are not qualified to issue loans under the Program:

(1) An agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;

(2) A lender that borrows money from any Federal Government source, other than the Federal Reserve Bank System, for purposes of relending;

(3) A lender that does not include the interest on loans it makes in gross income, for purposes of chapter 1, title 26 of the United States Code; and

(4) A lender that does not keep any ownership interest in loans it originates.

###### § 103.11 How does BIA approve lenders for the Program?

(a) BIA approves each lender by entering into a loan guaranty agreement and/or a loan insurance agreement with it. BIA may provide up to three different levels of approval for a lender making guaranteed loans, depending on factors such as:

(1) The number of loans the lender makes under the Program;

(2) The total principal balance of the lender's Program loans;

(3) The number of years the lender has been involved with the Program;

(4) The relative benefits and opportunities the lender has given to Indian business efforts through the Program; and

(5) The lender's historical compliance with Program requirements.

(b) BIA will consider a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement suspended as of:

(1) The effective date of a change in the lender's corporate structure;

(2) The effective date of a merger between the lender and any other entity, when the lender is not the surviving entity; or

(3) The start of any legal proceeding in which substantially all of the lender's assets may be subject to disposition through laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership.

(c) A change in a lender's name, without any other change specified under paragraph (b) of this section, will not cause a suspension of the lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement. The lender should notify BIA of its name change as soon as possible.

(d) If a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement is suspended under paragraph (b) of this section, the lender, or its successor in interest, must enter into a new loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement with BIA in order to secure any new BIA loan guarantees or insurance coverage.

(e) The suspension of a loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement does not affect the validity of any guaranty certificate or insurance coverage in effect before the date of the suspension. Any such certificate or insurance coverage will remain governed by applicable terms of the suspended loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement.

###### § 103.12 How does a lender apply for a loan guaranty?

To apply for a loan guaranty, a BIA-approved lender must submit to BIA a loan guaranty application request form, together with each of the following:

(a) A written explanation from the lender indicating why it needs a BIA guaranty for the loan, and the minimum loan guarantee percentage it will accept;

(b) A copy of the borrower's complete loan application;

(c) A description of the borrower's equity in the business being financed;

(d) A copy of the lender's independent credit analysis of the borrower's business, repayment ability, and loan collateral (including insurance);

(e) An original report from a nationally-recognized credit bureau, dated within 90 days of the date of the lender's loan guaranty application package, outlining the credit history of the borrower, and to the extent permitted by law, each co-maker or guarantor of the loan (if any);

(f) A copy of the lender's loan commitment letter to the borrower, showing at a minimum the proposed loan amount, purpose, interest rate, schedule of payments, and security (including insurance requirements), and the lender's terms and conditions for funding;

(g) The lender's good faith estimate of any loan-related fees and costs it will charge the borrower, as authorized under this part;

(h) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance construction, renovation, or demolition work, the lender's:

(1) Insurance and bonding requirements for the work;

(2) Proposed draw requirements; and

(3) Proposed work inspection procedures;

(i) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to refinance or otherwise retire existing indebtedness:

(1) A clear description of all loans being paid off, including the names of all makers, cosigners and guarantors, maturity dates, payment schedules, uncured delinquencies, collateral, and payoff amounts as of a specific date; and

(2) A comparison of the terms of the loan or loans being paid off and the terms of the new loan, identifying the advantages of the new loan over the loan being paid off.

###### § 103.13 How does a lender apply for loan insurance coverage?

BIA-approved lenders can make loans insured under the Program in two ways, depending on the size of the loan:

(a) For loans in an original principal amount of up to $100,000 per borrower, the lender can make each loan in accordance with the lender's loan insurance agreement, without specific prior approval from BIA.

(b) For loans in an original principal amount of over $100,000, the lender must seek BIA's specific prior approval in each case. The lender must submit a loan insurance coverage application request form, together with the same information required for a loan guaranty under § 103.12, except for the information required by § 103.12(a).

(c) The lender must submit a loan insurance application package even for a loan of less than $100,000 if:

(1) The total outstanding balance of all insured loans the lender is extending to the borrower under the Program exceeds $100,000; or

(2) the lender makes a request for interest subsidy, pursuant to § 103.21.

###### § 103.14 Can BIA request additional information?

BIA may require the lender to provide additional information, whenever BIA believes it needs the information to properly evaluate a new lender, guaranty application, or insurance application. After BIA issues a loan guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender must let BIA inspect the lender's records at any reasonable time for information concerning the Program.

###### § 103.15 Are there any prohibited loan terms?

A loan agreement guaranteed or insured under the Program may not contain:

(a) Charges by the lender styled as “points,” loan origination fees, or any similar fees (however named), except that if authorized in the loan agreement, the lender may charge the borrower a reasonable annual loan servicing fee that:

(1) Is not included as part of the loan principal; and

(2) Does not bear interest;

(b) Charges of any kind by the lender or by any third party except for the reasonable and customary cost of legal and architectural services, broker commissions, surveys, compliance inspections, title inspection and/or insurance, lien searches, appraisals, recording costs, premiums for required hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance, and such other charges as BIA may approve in writing;

(c) A loan repayment term of over 30 years;

(d) Payments scheduled less frequently than annually;

(e) A prepayment penalty, unless the terms of the penalty are clearly specified in BIA's loan guaranty or loan insurance conditions;

(f) An interest rate greater than what BIA considers reasonable, taking into account the range of rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans;

(g) A variable interest rate, unless the rate is tied to a specific prime rate published from time to time by a nationally recognized financial institution or news source;

(h) An increased rate of interest based on default;

(i) A fee imposed for the late repayment of any installment due, except for a late fee that:

(1) Is imposed only after the borrower is at least 30 days late with payment;

(2) Does not bear interest; and

(3) Equals no more than 5 percent of the late installment;

(j) An “insecurity” clause, or any similar provision permitting the lender to declare a loan default solely on the basis of its subjective view of the borrower's changed repayment prospects;

(k) A requirement that the borrower take title to any real or personal property purchased with loan proceeds by a title instrument containing restrictions on alienation, control or use of the property, unless otherwise required by applicable law; or

(l) A requirement that a borrower which is a tribe provide as security a general assignment of the tribe's trust income. If otherwise lawful, a tribe may provide as loan security an assignment of trust income from a specific source.

###### § 103.16 How does BIA approve or reject a loan guaranty or insurance application?

(a) BIA reviews each guaranty or insurance application, and may evaluate each loan application independently from the lender. BIA bases its loan guaranty or insurance decisions on many factors, including compliance with this part, and whether there is a reasonable prospect of loan repayment from business cash flow, or if necessary, from liquidating loan collateral. Lenders are expected to obtain a first lien security interest in enough collateral to reasonably secure repayment of each loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, to the extent that collateral is available.

(b) BIA approves applications by issuing an approval letter, followed by the procedures in § 103.18. If the guaranty or insurance application is incomplete, BIA may return the application to the lender, or hold the application while the lender submits the missing information. If BIA denies the application, it will provide the lender with a written explanation, with a copy to the borrower.

###### § 103.17 Must the lender follow any special procedures to close the loan?

(a) BIA officials or their representatives may attend the closing of any loan or loan modification that BIA agrees to guarantee or insure. For guaranteed loans, and insured loans that BIA must individually review under this part, the lender must give BIA notice of the date of closing at least 5 business days before closing occurs.

(b) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain appropriate, satisfactory title and/or lien searches for each asset to be used as loan collateral.

(c) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain recent appraisals for all real property and improvements to be used as collateral for the loan, to the extent required by law.

(d) At or prior to closing, the lender must document that the lender and borrower have complied with all applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws implicated by financing the borrower's business, for example by securing:

(1) Copies of all permits and licenses required to operate the borrower's business;

(2) Environmental studies required for construction and/or business operations under NEPA and other environmental laws;

(3) Archeological or historical studies required by law; and

(4) Certification by a registered surveyor or appropriate BIA official indicating that the proposed business will not be located in a special flood hazard area, as defined by applicable law.

(e) The lender must supply BIA with copies of all final, signed loan closing documents within 30 days following closing. To the extent applicable, loan closing documents must include the following:

(1) Promissory notes;

(2) Security agreements, including pledge and similar agreements, and related financing statements (together with BIA's written approval of any assignment of specific tribal trust assets under § 103.15(l), or of any security interest in an individual Indian money account);

(3) Mortgage instruments or deeds of trust (together with BIA's written approval, if required by 25 U.S.C. 483a, or if the mortgage is of a leasehold interest in tribal trust property);

(4) Guarantees (other than from BIA);

(5) Construction contracts, and plans and specifications;

(6) Leases related to the business (together with BIA's written approval, if required under 25 CFR part 162);

(7) Attorney opinion letters;

(8) Resolutions made by a Tribe or business entity;

(9) Waivers or partial waivers of sovereign immunity; and

(10) Similar instruments designed to document the loan, establish the basis for a security interest in loan collateral, and comply with applicable law.

(f) Unless BIA indicates otherwise in writing, the lender must close a guaranteed or insured loan within 90 days of any approval provided under § 103.16.

###### § 103.18 How does BIA issue a loan guaranty or confirm loan insurance?

(a) A loan is guaranteed under the Program when all of the following occur:

(1) BIA issues a signed loan guaranty certificate bearing a series number, an authorized signature, a guaranty percentage rate, the lender's name, the borrower's name, the original principal amount of the loan, and such other terms and conditions as BIA may require;

(2) The loan closes and funds;

(3) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan guaranty premium; and

(4) The lender meets all of the conditions listed in the loan guaranty certificate.

(b) A loan is insured under the Program when all of the following occur:

(1) The loan's purpose and terms meet the requirements of the Program and the lender's loan insurance agreement with BIA;

(2) The loan closes and funds;

(3) The lender notifies BIA of the borrower's identity and organizational structure, the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the payment schedule, and the date on which the loan closing and funding occurred;

(4) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan insurance premium;

(5) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, BIA approves the loan in writing; and

(6) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, the lender meets all of the conditions listed in BIA's written loan approval.

###### § 103.19 When must the lender pay BIA the loan guaranty or insurance premium?

The premium is due within 30 calendar days of the loan closing. If not paid on time, BIA will send the lender written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required), stating that the premium is due immediately. If the lender fails to make the premium payment within 30 calendar days of the date of BIA's notice, BIA's guaranty certificate or insurance coverage with respect to that particular loan is void, without further action.

##### Subpart C - Interest Subsidy

###### § 103.20 What is interest subsidy?

Interest subsidy is a payment BIA makes for the benefit of the borrower, to reimburse part of the interest payments the borrower has made on a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program. It is available to borrowers whose projected or historical earnings before interest and taxes, after adjustment for extraordinary items, is less than the industry norm.

###### § 103.21 Who applies for interest subsidy payments, and what is the application procedure?

(a) An eligible lender must request interest subsidy payments on behalf of an eligible borrower, after determining that the borrower qualifies. Typically, the lender should include a request for interest subsidy at the time it applies for a guaranty or insurance coverage under the Program. A request for interest subsidy must be supported by the information required in §§ 103.12 and 103.13 (relating to loan guaranty and insurance coverage applications). BIA approves, returns, or rejects interest subsidy requests in the same manner indicated in § 103.16, based on the factors in § 103.20 and BIA's available resources.

(b) BIA's approval of interest subsidy for an insured loan may provide for specific limitations on the manner in which the lender and borrower can modify the loan.

###### § 103.22 How does BIA determine the amount of interest subsidy?

Interest subsidy payments should equal the difference between the lender's rate of interest and the rate determined in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1464. BIA will fix the amount of interest subsidy as of the date it approves the interest subsidy request.

###### § 103.23 How does BIA make interest subsidy payments?

The lender must send BIA reports at least quarterly on the borrower's loan payment history, together with a calculation of the interest subsidy then due. The lender's reports and calculation do not have to be in any specific format, but in addition to the calculation the reports must contain at least the information required by § 103.33(a). Based on the lender's reports and calculation, BIA will send interest subsidy payments to the borrower in care of the lender. The payments belong to the borrower, but the borrower and lender may agree in advance on how the borrower will use interest subsidy payments. BIA may verify and correct interest subsidy calculations and payments at any time.

###### § 103.24 How long will BIA make interest subsidy payments?

(a) BIA will issue interest subsidy payments for the term of the loan, up to 3 years. If interest subsidy payments still are justified, the lender may apply for up to two 1-year extensions of this initial term. BIA will make interest subsidy payments on a single loan for no more than 5 years.

(b) BIA will choose the date from which it calculates interest subsidy years, usually the date the lender first extends the loan funds. Interest subsidy payments will apply to all loan payments made in the calendar years following that date.

(c) Interest subsidy payments will not be due for any loan payment made after the corresponding loan guaranty or insurance coverage stops under the Program, regardless of the circumstances.

##### Subpart D - Provisions Relating to Borrowers

###### § 103.25 What kind of borrower is eligible under the Program?

(a) A borrower is eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan if the borrower is:

(1) An Indian individual;

(2) An Indian-owned business entity organized under Federal, State, or tribal law, with an organizational structure reasonably acceptable to BIA;

(3) A tribe; or

(4) A business enterprise established and recognized by a tribe.

(b) To be eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan, a business entity or tribal enterprise must be at least 51 percent owned by Indians. If at any time a business entity or tribal enterprise becomes less than 51 percent Indian owned, the lender either may declare a default as of the date the borrower stopped being at least 51 percent Indian owned and exercise its remedies under this part, or else continue to extend the loan to the borrower and allow BIA's guaranty or insurance coverage to become invalid.

###### § 103.26 What must the borrower supply the lender in its loan application?

The lender may use any form of loan application it chooses. However, the borrower must supply the lender the information listed in this section in order for BIA to process a guaranty or insurance coverage application:

(a) The borrower's precise legal name, address, and tax identification number or social security number;

(b) Proof of the borrower's eligibility under the Program;

(c) A statement signed by the borrower, indicating that it is not delinquent on any Federal tax or other debt obligation;

(d) The borrower's business plan, including resumes of all principals and a detailed discussion of the product or service to be offered, market factors, the borrower's marketing strategy, and any technical assistance the borrower may require;

(e) A detailed description of the borrower's equity in the business being financed, including the method(s) of valuation;

(f) The borrower's balance sheets and operating statements for the preceding 3 years, or so much of that period that the borrower has been in business;

(g) The borrower's current financial statement, and the financial statements of all co-makers and guarantors of the loan (other than BIA);

(h) At least 3 years of financial projections for the borrower's business, consisting of pro-forma balance sheets, operating statements, and cash flow statements;

(i) A detailed list of all proposed collateral for the loan, including asset values and the method(s) of valuation;

(j) A detailed list of all proposed hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance the borrower will maintain on its business assets and operations;

(k) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance construction, renovation, or demolition work:

(1) Written quotes for the work from established and reputable contractors; and

(2) To the extent available, copies of all construction and architectural contracts for the work, plans and specifications, and applicable building permits;

(l) If the borrower is a tribe or a tribal enterprise, resolutions by the tribe and proof of authority under tribal law permitting the borrower to borrow the loan amount and offer the proposed loan collateral; and

(m) If the borrower is a business entity, resolutions by the appropriate governing officials and proof of authority under its organizing documents permitting the borrower to borrow the loan amount and offer the proposed loan collateral.

###### § 103.27 Can the borrower get help preparing its loan application or putting its loan funds to use?

A borrower may seek BIA's assistance when preparing a loan application or when planning business operations, including assistance identifying and complying with applicable laws as indicated by § 103.17(d). The borrower should contact the BIA field or agency office serving the area in which the borrower's business is to be located, or if there is no separate field or agency office serving the area, then the borrower should contact the BIA regional office serving the area.

##### Subpart E - Loan Transfers

###### § 103.28 What if the lender transfers part of the loan to another person?

(a) A lender may transfer one or more interests in a guaranteed loan to another person or persons, as long as the parties have in place an agreement that designates one person to perform all of the duties required of the lender under the Program and the loan guaranty certificate. Starting on the date of the transfer, only the person designated to perform the duties of the lender will be entitled to exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty certificate, and will from that point forward be considered the lender for purposes of the Program. A lender under the Program must both service the guaranteed loan and own at least a 10 percent interest in the guaranteed loan. BIA will not consider more than one person at any given time to be the lender with respect to any loan guaranty certificate. If the person designated to perform the duties of the lender in an agreement among loan participants is not the original lender, then the provisions of § 103.29(a) will apply (relating to sale or assignment of guaranteed loans), and the person designated to perform the duties of the lender must give BIA notice of its interest in the loan. Failure to provide notice in accordance with § 103.29(a) will void BIA's loan guaranty certificate, without further action.

(b) Transferring any interest in an insured loan to another person will void the insurance coverage for that loan, except where the transfer is effected by a merger.

###### § 103.29 What if the lender transfers the entire loan?

(a) A lender may transfer all of its rights in a guaranteed loan to any other person. The acquiring person must send BIA written notice of the transfer, describing the borrower, the loan, BIA's loan guaranty certificate number, and the acquiring person's name and address. Starting on the date of the transfer, only the acquiring person will be entitled to exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty certificate, and will from that point forward be considered the lender for purposes of the Program. The acquiring person must service the guaranteed loan and otherwise perform all of the duties required of the lender under the Program and the loan guaranty certificate. Except when a transfer is effected by a merger, any failure by the acquiring person to send BIA proper notice of the transfer within 30 calendar days of the transfer date will void BIA's loan guaranty certificate, without further action.

(b) Transferring an insured loan to another person will void the insurance coverage for that loan, except where the transfer is effected by a merger.

(c) If a lender is not the surviving entity after a merger, the lender's successor must notify BIA in writing of the change within 30 calendar days of the merger. The lender also must re-apply to become an approved lender under the Program, as indicated in § 103.11.

##### Subpart F - Loan Servicing Requirements

###### § 103.30 What standard of care must a lender meet?

Lenders must service all loans guaranteed or insured under the Program in a commercially reasonable manner, in accordance with standards and procedures adopted by prudent lenders in the BIA region in which the borrower's business is located, and in accordance with this part. If the lender fails to follow any of these standards, BIA may reduce or eliminate entirely the amount payable under its guaranty or insurance coverage to the extent BIA can reasonably attribute the loss to the lender's failure. BIA also may deny payment completely if the lender gets a loan guaranty or insurance coverage through fraud, or negligently allows a borrower's fraudulent loan application or use of loan funds to go undetected. In particular, and without limitation, lenders must:

(a) Check and verify information contained in the borrower's loan application, such as the borrower's eligibility, the authority of persons acting on behalf of the borrower, and the title status of any proposed collateral;

(b) Take reasonable precautions to assure that loan proceeds are used as specified in BIA's guaranty certificate or written insurance approval, or if not so specified, then in descending order of importance:

(1) BIA's written loan guaranty approval;

(2) The loan documents;

(3) The terms of the lender's final loan commitment to the borrower; or

(4) The borrower's loan application;

(c) When feasible, require the borrower to use automatic bank account debiting to make loan payments;

(d) Require the borrower to take title to real and personal property purchased with loan proceeds in the borrower's own name, except for real property to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a borrower that is a tribe;

(e) Promptly record all security interests and subsequently keep them in effect. Lenders must record all mortgages and other security interests in accordance with State and local law, including the laws of any tribe that may have jurisdiction. Lenders also must record any leasehold mortgages or assignments of income involving individual Indian or tribal trust land with the BIA office having responsibility for maintaining records on that trust land;

(f) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower and any guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) keep current on all taxes levied on real and personal property used in the borrower's business or as collateral for the loan, and on all applicable payroll taxes;

(g) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that all required insurance policies remain in effect, including hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance, in amounts reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the borrower, the borrower's business, and the lender;

(h) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower remains in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, local and tribal laws, including environmental laws and laws concerning the preservation of historical and archeological sites and data;

(i) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower causes any construction, renovation, or demolition work funded by the loan to proceed in accordance with approved construction contracts and plans and specifications, which must be sufficient in scope and detail to adequately govern the work;

(j) Reserve for itself and BIA the right to inspect the borrower's business records and all loan collateral at any reasonable time;

(k) Promptly notify the borrower in writing of any material breach by the borrower of the terms of its loan, with specific instructions on how to cure the breach and a deadline for doing so;

(l) Participate in any probate, receivership, bankruptcy, or similar proceeding involving the borrower and any guarantor or co-maker of the borrower's debt, to the extent necessary to maintain the greatest possible rights to repayment; and

(m) Otherwise seek to avoid and mitigate any potential loss arising from the loan, using at least that level of care the lender would use if it did not have a BIA loan guaranty or insurance coverage.

###### § 103.31 What loan servicing requirements apply to BIA?

Once a lender extends a loan that is guaranteed or insured under the Program, BIA has no responsibility for decisions concerning it, except for:

(a) Any approvals required under this part;

(b) Any decisions reserved to BIA under conditions of BIA's guaranty certificate or insurance coverage; and

(c) Decisions concerning a loan that the lender has assigned to BIA or to which BIA is subrogated by virtue of paying a claim based on a guaranty certificate or insurance coverage.

###### § 103.32 What sort of loan documentation does BIA expect the lender to maintain?

For every loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, the lender must maintain:

(a) BIA's original loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage approval letter, if applicable;

(b) Original signed and/or certified counterparts of all final loan documents, including those listed in § 103.17 (concerning documents required for loan closing), all renewals, modifications, and additions to those documents, and signed settlement statements;

(c) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all documents gathered by the lender under §§ 103.12, 103.13 and 103.26 (concerning information submitted by the borrower in its loan application, and information supplied to BIA in the lender's loan guaranty or insurance coverage application);

(d) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all applicable insurance binders or certificates, including without limitation hazard, liability, key man life, and title insurance;

(e) A complete and current history of all loan transactions, including dated disbursements, payments, adjustments, and notes describing all contacts with the borrower;

(f) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence with the borrower, including default notices and evidence of receipt;

(g) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence, notices, news items or other information concerning the borrower, whether gathered by the lender or furnished to it, containing material information about the borrower and its business operations;

(h) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all advertisements, notices, title instruments, accountings, and other documentation of efforts to liquidate loan collateral; and

(i) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all notices, pleadings, motions, orders, and other documents associated with any legal proceeding involving the lender and the borrower or its assets, including without limitation judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, suits to collect payment, bankruptcy proceedings, probate proceedings, and any settlement associated with threatened or actual litigation.

###### § 103.33 Are there reporting requirements?

(a) The lender must periodically report the borrower's loan payment history so that BIA can recalculate the government's contingent liability. Loan payment history reports must be quarterly unless BIA provides otherwise for a particular loan. These reports can be in any format the lender desires, as long as they contain:

(1) The lender's name;

(2) The borrower's name;

(3) A reference to BIA's Loan Guaranty Certificate or Loan Insurance Agreement number;

(4) The lender's internal loan number; and

(5) The date and amount of all loan balance activity for the reporting period.

(b) If applicable, the lender must supply a calculation of any interest subsidy payments that are due, as indicated in § 103.23.

(c) If there is a transfer of any or all of the lender's ownership interest in the loan, the party receiving the ownership interest may be required to notify BIA, as indicated in §§ 103.28 and 103.29.

(d) If there is a default on the loan, the lender must notify BIA, as indicated in §§ 103.35 and 103.36.

(e) If the borrower ceases to qualify for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan under § 103.25(b), the lender must promptly notify BIA even if the lender does not pursue default remedies under §§ 103.35 and 103.36. This notice allows BIA to eliminate the guaranty or insurance coverage from its active recordkeeping system.

(f) If the loan is prepaid in full, the lender must promptly notify BIA in writing so that BIA can eliminate the guaranty or insurance coverage from its active recordkeeping system.

(g) If a lender changes its name, it should notify BIA in accordance with § 103.11(c).

###### § 103.34 What if the lender and borrower decide to change the terms of the loan?

(a) The lender must obtain written BIA approval before modifying a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, if the change will:

(1) Increase the borrower's outstanding principal amount (if a term loan), or maximum available credit (if a revolving loan).

(i) BIA will approve or disapprove a loan increase based upon the lender's explanation of the borrower's need for additional funding, and updated information of the sort required under §§ 103.12, 103.13, and 103.26, as applicable.

(ii) Upon approval by BIA and payment of an additional guaranty or insurance premium in accordance with §§ 103.8 and 103.19 and this section, the entire outstanding loan amount, as modified, will be guaranteed or insured (as the case may be) to the extent BIA specifies. The lender must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the outstanding principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the increase in the credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving loan).

(iii) Lenders may not increase the outstanding principal amount of a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program if a significant purpose of doing so would be to allow the borrower to pay accrued loan interest it otherwise would have difficulty paying.

(2) Permanently adjust the loan repayment schedule.

(3) Increase a fixed interest rate, convert a fixed interest rate to an adjustable interest rate, or convert an adjustable interest rate to a fixed interest rate.

(4) Allow any changes in the identity or organizational structure of the borrower.

(5) Allow any material change in the use of loan proceeds or the nature of the borrower's business.

(6) Release any collateral taken as security for the loan, except items sold in the ordinary course of business and promptly replaced by similar items of collateral, such as inventory.

(7) Allow the borrower to move any significant portion of its business operations to a location that is not on or near an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA.

(8) Be likely to materially increase the risk of a claim on BIA's guaranty or insurance coverage, or materially reduce the aggregate value of the collateral securing the loan.

(9) Cure a default for which BIA is to receive notice under § 103.35(b).

(b) In the case of an insured loan, the amount of which will not exceed $100,000 when combined with all other insured loans from the lender to the borrower, the lender need not obtain BIA's prior approval to make any of the loan modifications indicated in § 103.34(a), except as provided in § 103.21(b). However, all loan modifications must remain consistent with the lender's loan insurance agreement with BIA, and in the event of an increase in the borrower's outstanding principal amount (if a term loan), or maximum available credit (if a revolving loan), the lender must send BIA an additional premium payment in accordance with §§ 103.8, 103.19 and this section. The lender must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the outstanding principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the increase in the credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving loan). To the extent a loan modification changes any of the information supplied to BIA under § 103.18(b)(3), the lender also must promptly notify BIA of the new information.

(c) Subject to any applicable BIA loan guaranty or insurance coverage conditions, a lender may extend additional loans to a borrower without BIA approval, if the additional loans are not to be guaranteed or insured under the Program.

##### Subpart G - Default and Payment by BIA

###### § 103.35 What must the lender do if the borrower defaults on the loan?

(a) The lender must send written notice of the default to the borrower, and otherwise meet the standard of care established for the lender in this part. The lender's notice to the borrower should be sent as soon as possible after the default, but in any event before the lender's notice to BIA under paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes of the Program, “default” will mean a default as defined in this part.

(b) The lender also must send written notice of the default to BIA by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 60 calendar days of the default, unless the default is fully cured before that deadline. This notice is required even if the lender grants the borrower a forbearance under § 103.36(a). One purpose of the notice is to give BIA the opportunity to intervene and seek assistance for the borrower, even though BIA has no duty, either to the lender or the borrower, to do so. Another purpose of the notice is to permit BIA to plan for a possible loss claim from the lender, under § 103.36(d). The lender's notice must clearly indicate:

(1) The identity of the borrower;

(2) The applicable Program guaranty certificate or insurance agreement number;

(3) The date and nature of all bases for default;

(4) If a monetary default, the amount of past due principal and interest, the date through which interest has been calculated, and the amount of any late fees, precautionary advances, or other amounts the lender claims;

(5) The nature and outcome of any correspondence or other contacts with the borrower concerning the default; and

(6) The precise nature of any action the borrower could take to cure the default.

###### § 103.36 What options and remedies does the lender have if the borrower defaults on the loan?

(a) The lender may grant the borrower a temporary forbearance, even beyond any default cure periods specified in the loan documents, if doing so is likely to result in the borrower curing the default. However, BIA must approve in writing any forbearance or other agreement that:

(1) Permanently modifies the terms of the loan in any manner indicated by § 103.34(a);

(2) Would allow the borrower's default to extend beyond the deadline established in § 103.36(d) for the lender to elect a remedy; or

(3) Is not likely to result in the borrower curing the default.

(b) The lender may make precautionary advances on the borrower's behalf during the default, if doing so is reasonably necessary to ensure that loan recovery prospects do not significantly deteriorate. Items for which the lender may make precautionary advances include, for example:

(1) Hazard, liability, or key man life insurance premiums;

(2) Security measures to safeguard abandoned business assets;

(3) Real or personal property taxes;

(4) Corrective actions required by court or administrative orders; or

(5) Essential maintenance.

(c) BIA will guaranty or insure the amount of precautionary advances from the date of each advance to the same extent as other amounts due under the loan, if:

(1) The borrower has demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to make the payment or perform the duty that jeopardizes loan recovery, including by undue delay in making the payment or performing the duty;

(2) The total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender does not at the time of the advance exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan;

(3) Where loan document provisions do not require the borrower to repay precautionary advances (however termed) when made by the lender, or where the total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender will exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan when made, the lender secures BIA's prior written approval; and

(4) The lender properly claims and documents all precautionary advances, if and when it submits a claim for loss under § 103.37.

(d) If the default remains uncured, the lender must send BIA a written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 90 calendar days of the default to select one of the following remedies:

(1) In the case of a guaranteed loan, the lender may submit a claim to BIA for its loss;

(2) In the case of either a guaranteed or insured loan, the lender may liquidate all collateral securing the loan, and upon completion, if it has a residual loss on the loan, it may submit a claim to BIA for that loss; or

(3) The lender may negotiate a loan modification agreement with the borrower to permanently change the terms of the loan in a manner that will cure the default. If the lender chooses this remedy, it may take no longer than 45 calendar days from the date BIA receives the notice of remedy selection to finalize a loan modification agreement and secure BIA's written approval of it, unless BIA specifically extends this deadline in writing. However, the lender may at any time before the expiration of the 45-day period (or any extension thereof) change its choice of remedy by sending BIA a notice otherwise complying with § 103.36(d)(1) or (2). If the lender fails to send BIA a notice changing its choice of remedy and does not finalize an approved loan modification agreement within the 45-day period (or any extension thereof), the lender's only permissible remedy under the Program will be to pursue the procedure specified in § 103.36(d)(2).

(e) Failure by the lender to provide BIA with notice of the lender's election of remedy within 90 calendar days of the default, as indicated in § 103.36(d), will invalidate BIA's loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage for that particular loan, absent an express waiver of this provision by BIA. BIA may preserve the validity of a loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage through waiver of this provision only when BIA determines, in its discretion, that:

(1) The lender consistently has acted in good faith, and

(2) The lender's failure to provide timely notice either:

(i) Has not caused any actual or potential prejudice to BIA; or

(ii) Was the result of the lender relying upon specific written advice from a BIA official.

###### § 103.37 What must the lender do to collect payment under its loan guaranty certificate or loan insurance coverage?

(a) For guaranteed loans, the lender must submit a claim for its loss on a form approved by BIA.

(1) If the lender makes an immediate claim under § 103.36(d)(1), it must send BIA the claim for loss within 90 calendar days of the default by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required). The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the date it submits the claim.

(2) If the lender elects first to liquidate the collateral securing the loan under § 103.36(d)(2), and has a residual loss after doing so, it must send BIA the claim for loss within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the earlier of:

(i) The date it submits the claim;

(ii) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or

(iii) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.

(b) For insured loans, after liquidating all loan collateral, the lender must submit a claim for its loss (if any) on a form approved by BIA. The lender must send BIA the claim for loss by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 30 calendar days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan through the earlier of:

(1) The date it submits the claim;

(2) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the loan; or

(3) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.

(c) Whenever the lender liquidates loan collateral under § 103.36(d)(2), it must vigorously pursue all reasonable methods of collection concerning the loan collateral before submitting a claim for its residual loss (if any) to BIA. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the lender must:

(1) Foreclose, either judicially or non-judicially, all rights of redemption the borrower or any co-maker or guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) may have in collateral under any mortgage securing the loan;

(2) Gather and dispose of all personal property pledged as collateral under the loan, in accordance with applicable law;

(3) Exercise all set-off rights the lender may have under contract or applicable law;

(4) Make demand for payment on the borrower, all co-makers, and all guarantors of the loan (other than BIA); and

(5) Participate fully in all bankruptcy proceedings that may arise involving the borrower and any co-maker or guarantor of the loan. Full participation might include, for example, filing a proof of claim in the case, attending creditors' meetings, and seeking a court order releasing the automatic stay of collection efforts so that the lender can liquidate affected loan collateral.

(d) BIA may require further information, including without limitation copies of any documents the lender is to maintain under § 103.32 and all documentation of liquidation efforts, to help BIA evaluate the lender's claim for loss.

(e) BIA will pay the lender the guaranteed or insured portion of the lender's claim for loss, to the extent the claim is based upon reasonably sufficient evidence of the loss and compliance with the requirements of this part. BIA will render a decision on a claim for loss within 90 days of receiving all information it requires to properly evaluate the loss.

###### § 103.38 Is there anything else for BIA or the lender to do after BIA makes payment?

When BIA pays the lender on its claim for loss, the lender must sign and deliver to BIA an assignment of rights to its loan agreement with the borrower, in a document acceptable to BIA. Immediately upon payment, BIA is subrogated to all rights of the lender under the loan agreement with the borrower, and must pursue collection efforts against the borrower and any co-maker and guarantor, as required by law.

###### § 103.39 When will BIA refuse to pay all or part of a lender's claim?

BIA may deny all or part of a lender's claim for loss when:

(a) The loan is not guaranteed or insured as indicated in § 103.18;

(b) The guarantee or insurance coverage has become invalid under §§ 103.28, 103.29, or 103.36(e);

(c) The lender has not met the standard of care indicated in § 103.30;

(d) The lender presents a claim for a residual loss after attempting to liquidate loan collateral, and:

(1) The lender has not made a reasonable effort to liquidate all security for the loan;

(2) The lender has taken an unreasonable amount of time to complete its liquidation efforts, the probable consequence of which has been to reduce overall prospects of loss recovery; or

(3) The lender's loss claim is inflated by unreasonable liquidation expenses or unjustifiable deductions from collateral liquidation proceeds applied to the loan balance; or

(e) The lender has otherwise failed in any material respect to follow the requirements of this part, and BIA can reasonably attribute some or all of the lender's loss to that failure.

###### § 103.40 Will BIA make exceptions to its criteria for denying payment?

(a) BIA will not reduce or deny payment solely on the basis of §§ 103.39(c) or (e) when the lender making the claim for loss:

(1) Is a person to whom a previous lender transferred the loan under §§ 103.28 or 103.29 before maturity for value;

(2) Notified BIA of its acquisition of the loan interest as required by §§ 103.28 or 103.29;

(3) Had no involvement in or knowledge of the actions or circumstances that would have allowed BIA to reduce or deny payment to a previous lender; and

(4) Has not itself violated the standards set forth in §§ 103.39(c) or (e).

(b) If BIA makes payment to a lender under this section, it may seek reimbursement from the previous lender or lenders who contributed to the loss by violating §§ 103.39(c) or (e).

###### § 103.41 What happens if a lender violates provisions of this part?

In addition to reducing or eliminating payment on a specific claim for loss, BIA may either temporarily suspend, or permanently bar, a lender from making or acquiring loans under the Program if the lender repeatedly fails to abide by the requirements of this part, or if the lender significantly violates the requirements of this part on any single occasion.

###### § 103.42 How long must a lender comply with Program requirements?

(a) A lender must comply in general with Program requirements during:

(1) The effective period of its loan guaranty agreement or loan insurance agreement; and

(2) Whatever additional period is necessary to resolve any outstanding loan guaranty or insurance claims or coverage the lender may have.

(b) Except as otherwise required by law, a lender must maintain records with respect to a particular loan for 6 years after either:

(1) The loan is repaid in full; or

(2) The lender accepts payment from BIA for a loss on the loan, pursuant to a guaranty certificate or an insurance agreement.

(c) At any time 2 years or more following one of the events specified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, a lender may convert its records for corresponding loans to any electronic format that is readily retrievable and that provides an accurate, detailed image of the original records. Upon converting its records in this manner, the lender may dispose of its original loan records.

(d) This section does not restrict any claims BIA may have against the lender or any other party arising from the lender's participation in the Program.

###### § 103.43 What must the lender do after repayment in full?

The lender must completely and promptly release of record all remaining collateral for a guaranteed or insured loan after the loan has been paid in full. The release must be at the lender's sole cost. In addition, if the loan is prepaid the lender must notify BIA in accordance with § 103.33(f).

#### PART 134 - PARTIAL PAYMENT CONSTRUCTION CHARGES ON INDIAN IRRIGATION PROJECTS

##### § 134.1 Partial reimbursement of irrigation charges; 5 percent per annum of cost of system, June 30, 1920.

In pursuance of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), regulations governing partial payment of construction charges on Indian irrigation projects, with the exception of certain ones mentioned therein, where approved by the Department June 21, 1920, and require that each owner of irrigable land under any irrigation system constructed for the benefit of Indians under provisions of law requiring reimbursement of the cost of such system and to which land, water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from such system, shall pay, on or before November 15, 1920, a sum equal to 5 percent of the per acre cost, as of June 30, 1920, of the construction of the system under which such land is situated. The per acre cost of a given system as of June 30, 1920, shall be determined by dividing the total amount expended for construction purposes on such system up to that day by the total area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered on that date; and on November 15 of each year following the year 1920, until further notice, the land owners, as therein prescribed, shall pay 5 percent of the per acre construction cost as of June 30, of the current year, such per acre cost to be determined by dividing the cost of the system to June 30 of that year by the total area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from the system on that date. Provision is contained that no payments shall be required under the regulations in behalf of lands still in process of allotment or prior to the issuance of the first or trust patent therefor, nor for lands reserved for school, agency, or other administrative purposes where the legal title still remains in the United States.

##### § 134.2 Landowners financially unable to pay.

Considerable difficulty has been encountered in collecting charges under the regulations in this part owing to the fact that Indians have been financially unable to pay the charges, the result being that the construction charges have accrued against the lands and in cases where the land is sold for the benefit of the allottee or his heirs under the regulations, the purchaser is to pay the accrued and future irrigation charges which make it difficult in some instances, to sell the land at as favorable terms as might otherwise be secured.

##### § 134.3 Period for payments extended.

Furthermore, in recent legislation dealing with specific projects in the Bureau and also all reclamation projects the policy has been to extend the payment of such charges over a longer period of years.

##### § 134.4 Annual payment reduced.

In view of these conditions the regulations governing this matter are hereby modified so as to distribute the unaccrued installments over a period of time so that 2percent of the total amount yet due shall be due and payable on November 15 of each year until further notice. You shall accordingly ascertain the per acre cost after deducting the amount of the accrued charges and take 2percent of that amount and a like sum each year so that the amount of the annual installments will be the same each year. Superintendents are obligated to submit all proposed lists of sales involving allotments containing irrigable allotments to the project or supervising engineer for checking, as to the irrigable acreage and amounts of unpaid construction, operation, and maintenance charges against such allotments. Each sale forwarded to the Bureau for action shall be accompanied by contract executed on Form 5&#x2013;462b where irrigable acreage is involved and after approval thereof a copy of contract on said form shall be sent to the project engineer for his records and the charges paid by the purchaser shall be turned over to the disbursing agent for credit and deposit as instructed in the next paragraph. The regulations in this part shall not apply to lands in the Wapato project, on the Yakima Indian Reservation, nor to the irrigation projects on the Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, and Crow Reservations, Montana, for which special regulations have been issued nor to the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho, or the San Carlos project, Arizona.

##### § 134.4a Assessment and collection of additional construction costs.

(a) Upon the completion of the construction of an Indian irrigation project, or unit thereof, subsequent to the determination of the partial per acre construction assessment rate which was fixed prior to July 1, 1957, pursuant to § 134.4 the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative shall determine such additional construction cost and distribute that cost on a per acre basis against all of the irrigable lands of the project, or unit thereof, andth of such per acre additional construction cost thus determined shall be assessed and collected annually from the non-Indian landowner of the project, or unit, thereof. The first installment shall be due and payable on November 15 of the year following the completion of such additional construction work or, if such additional construction work on the project, or unit thereof, has been completed prior to July 1, 1957, and the per acre annual rate determined, the first installment of the additional construction cost to be repaid by such non-Indian landowners shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958. This annual per acre rate shall be in addition to, and run concurrently with, the per acre construction rate assessed annually under § 134.4.

(b) Project lands in Indian ownership are not subject to assessment for their proportionate share of the per acre construction cost of the project, or unit thereof, until after the Indian title to the land has been extinguished. At that time the total annual per acre assessment rate against non-Indian lands of the project, or unit thereof, shall be assessed against the former Indian lands for each and every acre of irrigable land to which water can be delivered through the project works, beginning on November 15 of the year following the extinguishment of the Indian title to the land and on November 15 of each year thereafter over a forty year period. In cases where the Indian title to project land was extinguished prior to July 1, 1957, the assessment rate shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958.

##### § 134.5 Payments to disbursing officer.

Payments under this part shall be made to the disbursing officer for the supervising engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service having jurisdiction over the irrigation system under which the land for which payment is made may lie. The sum so collected will then, after proper credit has been made to the land for which collected, be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the respective funds used in constructing irrigation systems toward which reimbursement shall have been made.

##### § 134.6 “Owner” defined.

The word “owner” as used in this part shall be construed to include any person, Indian or white, or any firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization to whom title to the land capable of irrigation, as provided in the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), has passed, either by fee or trust patent, or otherwise.

##### § 134.7 Modifications.

The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a), cancelled all irrigation assessments for construction costs against lands in Indian ownership which were unpaid at that date and deferred all future assessments for construction costs until the Indian title to the land shall have been extinguished.

###### § 135.2 Annual rate of assessments.

Within the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District there are 3,196.8 acres for which the District is obligated by contract to pay its proper share of the total construction costs. Within the Upper Little Horn Irrigation District there are 1,554.7 acres for which the District is obligated by contract to pay its proper share of the total construction costs. There are 3,237.6 acres, more or less, covered by contracts with private landowners, obligating such owners to pay their proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre rate of $0.6595. For the purpose of this notice the annual per acre rate is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual per acre rate of assessment will continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of construction costs of $210,726 is to be repaid without interest. The amount of each annual installment chargeable against each of the Districts for the acreage covered by their respective contracts shall be determined by multiplying the total acreage, under each contract entitled to Willow Creek storage rights, either directly or by subsituation, by the per acre annual rate.

###### § 135.3 Annual assessments.

Notice is hereby given of an annual assessment of $2,108.05 to be repaid by the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District for the 3,196.8 acres of irrigable land of the District, and an annual assessment of $1,025.06 to be repaid by the Upper Little Horn Irrigation District for the 1,554.7 acres of irrigable land of the District. Against the amounts due annually by the Districts under this notice, there shall be allowed any credits due under section 6 of the act of June 28, 1946.

#### PART 136 - FORT HALL INDIAN IRRIGATION PROJECT, IDAHO

##### § 136.1 Repayment contracts.

A rehabilitation program was established on the Fort Hall Unit of the Fort Hall Project in 1936. Based upon the estimated construction costs, contracts were signed by all non-Indian landowners within the project, including such landowners within the Little Indian Unit, now a part of the Fort Hall Unit. Under the terms of their contracts, the landowners agreed to repay to the Government their pro rata share, on an acreage basis, of all expenditures for construction and other necessary improvements for carrying out the approved program, payments not to exceed $7.50 per acre, based upon an estimated expenditure of $450,000.00 for a project then considered as covering approximately 60,000 acres.

##### § 136.2 Construction costs.

The program of rehabilitation has now been completed at a cost of $419,186.52. This amount, chargeable on an equal per acre basis against 60,000 acres, amounts to a rate of $6.986 per acre, which rate is hereby determined to be the per acre cost to be repaid to the United States under the 1936 contracts.

##### § 136.3 Repayment of construction costs.

Under the terms of the contracts, the landowners agreed to repay the construction cost in forty (40) equal annual installments.

Of the 50,000 acres constituting the lands in private ownership within the said project only 46,107.49 acres have at this date (Dec. 1, 1932) actually been designated as coming within the project. Should this present designated area be not increased within a reasonable time herefrom and prior to the due date of the first installment of the charge fixed in this section, namely, on December 1, 1935, so as to bring the total designated area up to the 50,000 acres, the per acre charge fixed in this section shall be proportionately increased against the then designated area so as to assure reimbursement of the total indebtedness due the Government by the owners of the lands in private ownership from the lesser designated acreage.

#### PART 159 - SALE OF IRRIGABLE LANDS, SPECIAL WATER CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

##### § 159.1 Conditions of contract.

(a) The form of contract (Form 5&#x2013;462b)for sale of irrigable lands specifically provides that the purchaser will obligate and pay on a per acre basis all irrigation charges assessed or to be assessed against the land purchased including accrued assessment, which accrued assessment shall be paid prior to the approval of the sale, and for the payment of the construction and operation and maintenance assessments on the due dates of each year. The agreement is to be acknowledged and recorded in the county records in which county the land is situated. The charges incidental to the recording of the instrument shall be paid by the purchaser at the time of executing the agreement.

(b) A strict compliance with the terms of paragraph (a) of this section is absolutely necessary and required.

#### PART 160 - INCLUSION OF LIENS IN ALL PATENTS AND INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED

##### § 160.1 Liens.

The act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210; 25 U.S.C. 387) creates a first lien against irrigable lands under all Indian irrigation projects where the construction, operation and maintenance costs of such projects remain unpaid and are reimbursable, and directs that such lien shall be recited in any patent or instrument issued for such lands to cover such unpaid charges. Prior to the enactment of this legislation similar liens had been created by legislative authority against irrigable lands of the projects on the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and Gila River Reservations, in Arizona; Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, Fort Belknap, and Crow Reservations, Mont.; Wapato project, Yakima Reservation, Wash.; the irrigable lands on the Colville Reservation within the West Okanogan irrigation district, Washington, and the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho. This legislation, therefore, extends protection similar to that existing in the legislation applicable to the projects on the reservations above mentioned.

##### § 160.2 Instructions.

All superintendents and other officers are directed to familiarize themselves with this provision of law, and in all cases involving the issuance of patents or deeds direct to the Indian or purchaser of Indian allotments embracing irrigable lands, they will recite in the papers forwarded to the Department for action the fact that the lands involved are within an irrigation project (giving the name) and accordingly are subject to the provisions of this law. This requirement will be in addition to the existing regulations requiring the superintendents in case of sales of irrigable lands to obtain from the project engineer a written statement relative to the irrigability of the lands to be sold, and whether or not there are any unpaid irrigation charges, together with the estimated per acre construction cost assessable against the land involved in the sale. Each sale will also be accompanied by contract executed in accordance with regulations obligating the purchaser to pay the accrued charges, namely, construction, operation, and maintenance, prior to the approval of the sale and to assume and pay the unassessed irrigation charges in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.

##### § 160.3 Leases to include description of lands.

It is important, also, for superintendents in leasing irrigable lands to present to the project engineer lists containing descriptions of the lands involved for his approval of the irrigable acreage and for checking as to whether or not such lands are in fact irrigable under existing works. Strict compliance with this section is required for the purpose of avoiding error.

##### § 160.4 Prompt payment of irrigation charges by lessees.

Superintendents will also see that irrigation charges are promptly paid by lessees, and where such charges are not so paid take appropriate and prompt action for their collection. Such unpaid charges are a lien against the land, and accordingly any failure on the part of the superintendents to collect same increases the obligation against the land.

Yes. When the Navajo Nation and BIA approve a special land use, the grazing permit will be modified to reflect the change in available forage. If a special land use is inconsistent with grazing activities authorized in the permit, the special land use area will be withdrawn from the permit, and grazing cannot take place on that part of the range unit.

##### Subpart G - Permit Violations

###### § 161.600 What permit violations are addressed by this subpart?

This subpart addresses violations of permit provisions other than trespass. Trespass is addressed under subpart H.

###### § 161.601 How will BIA monitor permit compliance?

Unless the permit provides otherwise, BIA and/or Navajo Nation may enter the range unit at any reasonable time, without prior notice, to protect the interests of the Navajo Nation and ensure that the permittee is in compliance with the operating requirements of the permit.

###### § 161.602 Will my permit be canceled for non-use?

(a) If a grazing permit is not used by the permittee for a 2-year period, BIA may cancel the permit upon the recommendation of the Grazing Committee and with the concurrence of the Resources Committee under § 161.606(c). Non-use consists of, but is not limited to, absence of livestock on the range unit, and/or abandonment of a permittee's grazing permit.

(b) Unused grazing permits or portions of grazing permits that are set aside for range recovery will not be cancelled for non-use.

###### § 161.603 Can mediation be used in the event of a permit violation or dispute?

A permit may provide for permit disputes or violations to be resolved with the District Grazing Committee through mediation.

(a) The District Grazing Committee will conduct the mediation before the Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body, before BIA invokes any cancellation remedies.

(b) Conducting the mediation may substitute for permit cancellation. However, BIA retains the authority to cancel the permit under § 161.606.

(c) The Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body decision will be final, unless it is appealed to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court on a question of law. BIA will defer to any ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to BIA under § 161.606.

###### § 161.604 What happens if a permit violation occurs?

(a) If the Resources Committee notifies BIA that a specific permit violation has occurred, BIA will initiate an appropriate investigation within 5 business days of that notification.

(b) Unless otherwise provided under tribal law, when BIA has reason to believe that a permit violation has occurred, BIA or the authorized tribal representative will provide written notice to the permittee within 5 business days.

###### § 161.605 What will a written notice of a permit violation contain?

The written notice of a permit violation will provide the permittee with 10 days from the receipt of the written notice to:

(a) Cure the permit violation and notify BIA that the violation is cured;

(b) Explain why BIA should not cancel the permit;

(c) Request in writing additional time to complete corrective actions. If additional time is granted, BIA may require that certain actions be taken immediately; or

(d) Request mediation under § 161.603.

###### § 161.606 What will BIA do if the permittee doesn't cure a violation on time?

(a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required time period, or if the violation is not referred to District Grazing Committee for mediation, BIA will consult with the Navajo Nation, as appropriate, and determine whether:

(1) The permit may be canceled by BIA under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 161.607 through 161.608;

(2) BIA may invoke any other remedies available to BIA under the permit;

(3) The Navajo Nation may invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or

(4) The permittee may be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

(b) If BIA grants a permittee a time extension to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time from the date on which the extension is granted.

(c) If BIA cancels the permit, BIA will send the permittee and the District Grazing Committee a written notice of cancellation within 5 business days of the decision. BIA will also provide actual or constructive notice of the cancellation to the Navajo Nation, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:

(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

(2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid fees and other financial obligations due under the permit;

(3) Notify the permittee of his or her right to appeal under 25 CFR part 2 of this title, as modified by § 161.607, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

(4) Order the permittee to cease grazing livestock on the next anniversary date of the grazing permit or 180 days following the receipt of the written notice of cancellation, whichever is sooner.

###### § 161.607 What appeal bond provisions apply to permit cancellation decisions?

(a) The appeal bond provisions in § 2.5 of part 2 of this title will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decision. Instead, when BIA decides to cancel a permit, BIA may require the permittee to post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in part 2 of this title.

(b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect the Navajo Nation against financial losses that will likely result from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the permit cancellation decision.

###### § 161.608 When will a permit cancellation be effective?

A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation from BIA. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the permittee files an appeal under § 161.607 and part 2 of this title, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 161.607 and part 2 of this title, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of cancellation from BIA.

###### § 161.609 Can BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is threatened?

Yes, if a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Navajo Nation land during the term of a permit, BIA will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart H, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Navajo Nation, either before or after the emergency action is taken.

###### § 161.610 What will BIA do if livestock is not removed when a permit expires or is cancelled?

If the livestock is not removed after the expiration or cancellation of a permit, BIA will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. BIA may remove the livestock on behalf of the Navajo Nation, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, including the assessment of civil penalties and costs under subpart H.

##### Subpart H - Trespass

###### § 161.700 What is trespass?

Under this part, trespass is any unauthorized use of, or action on, Navajo partitioned grazing lands.

###### § 161.701 What is BIA's trespass policy?

BIA will:

(a) Investigate accidental, willful, and/or incidental trespass on Navajo Partitioned Lands;

(b) Respond to alleged trespass in a prompt, efficient manner;

(c) Assess trespass penalties for the value of products used or removed, cost of damage to the Navajo Partitioned Lands, and enforcement costs incurred as a consequence of the trespass; and

(d) Ensure, to the extent possible, that damage to Navajo Partitioned Lands resulting from trespass is rehabilitated and stabilized at the expense of the trespasser.

###### § 161.702 Who will enforce this subpart?

(a) BIA enforces the provisions of this subpart. If the Navajo Nation adopts the provisions of this subpart, the Navajo Nation will have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce this subpart. Additionally, if the Navajo Nation so requests, BIA will defer to tribal prosecution of trespass on Navajo Partitioned Lands.

(b) Nothing in this subpart will be construed to diminish the sovereign authority of the Navajo Nation with respect to trespass.

##### Subpart I - Concurrence/Appeals/Amendments

###### § 161.800 How does the Navajo Nation provide concurrence to BIA?

(a) Actions taken by BIA under this part require concurrence of the Navajo Nation under section 640d&#x2013;9(e)(1)(A) of the Settlement Act.

(b) For any action requiring the concurrence of the Resources Committee, the following procedures will apply:

(1) Unless a longer time is specified in a particular section, or unless BIA grants an extension of time, the Resources Committee will have 45 days to review and concur with the proposed action;

(2) If the Resources Committee concurs in writing with all or part of BIA proposed action, the action or a portion of it may be immediately implemented;

(3) If the Resources Committee does not concur with all or part of the proposed action within the time prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, BIA will submit to the Resources Committee a written declaration of non-concurrence. BIA will then notify the Resources Committee in writing of a formal hearing to be held not sooner than 30 days from the date of the non-concurrence declaration;

(4) The formal hearing on non-concurrence will permit the submission of written evidence and argument concerning the proposal. BIA will take minutes of the hearing. Following the hearing, BIA may amend, alter, or otherwise change the proposed action. If, following a hearing, BIA alters or amends portions of the proposed plan of action, BIA will submit the altered or amended portions of the plan to the Resources Committee for its concurrence; and

(5) If the Resources Committee fails or refuses to give its concurrence to the proposal, BIA may implement the proposal only after issuing a written order, based upon findings of fact, that the proposed action is necessary to protect the land under the Settlement Act and the Agricultural Act.

###### § 161.801 May decisions under this part be appealed?

(a) Appeals of BIA decisions issued under this part may be taken in accordance with procedures in part 2 of 25 CFR.

(b) All appeals of decisions by the Grazing Committee and Resources Committee will be forwarded to the Navajo Nation's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

###### § 161.802 How will the Navajo Nation recommend amendments to this part?

The Resources Committee will have final authority on behalf of the Navajo Nation to approve amendments to the Navajo Partitioned Lands grazing provisions, upon the recommendation of the Grazing Committee and the Navajo-Hopi Land Commission, and the concurrence of BIA.

(a) An agricultural lease negotiated by Indian landowners may cover more than one tract of Indian land, but the minimum consent requirements for leases granted by Indian landowners under subparts B through D of this part will apply to each tract separately. We may combine multiple tracts into a unit for leases negotiated or advertised by us, if we determine that unitization is in the Indian landowners' best interests and consistent with the efficient administration of the land.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in the agricultural lease, the rent or other consideration derived from a unitized agricultural lease will be distributed based on the size of each landowner's interest in proportion to the acreage within the entire unit.

###### § 162.106 What will BIA do if possession is taken without an approved agricultural lease or other proper authorization?

(a) If an agricultural lease is required, and possession is taken without an agricultural lease by a party other than an Indian landowner of the tract, we will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the party in possession is engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain an agricultural lease, we will take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law.

(b) Where a trespass involves Indian agricultural land, we will also assess civil penalties and costs under part 166, subpart I, of this chapter.

###### § 162.107 What are BIA's objectives in granting or approving agricultural leases?

We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land for agricultural purposes. For the purposes of §§ 162.102 through 162.256:

(a) We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land, either through negotiations or advertisement. In reviewing a negotiated lease for approval, we will defer to the landowners' determination that the lease is in their best interest, to the maximum extent possible. In granting a lease on the landowners' behalf, we will obtain a fair annual rental and attempt to ensure (through proper notice) that the use of the land is consistent with the landowners' wishes. We will also recognize the rights of Indian landowners to use their own land, so long as their Indian co-owners are in agreement and the value of the land is preserved.

(b) We will recognize the governing authority of the tribe having jurisdiction over the land to be leased, preparing and advertising leases in accordance with applicable tribal laws and policies. We will promote tribal control and self-determination over tribal land and other land under the tribe's jurisdiction, through contracts and self-governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. § 450f

###### § 162.108 What are BIA's responsibilities in administering and enforcing agricultural leases?

(a) We will ensure that tenants meet their payment obligations to Indian landowners, through the collection of rent on behalf of the landowners and the prompt initiation of appropriate collection and enforcement actions. We will also assist landowners in the enforcement of payment obligations that run directly to them, and in the exercise of any negotiated remedies that apply in addition to specific remedies made available to us under these or other regulations.

(b) We will ensure that tenants comply with the operating requirements in their agricultural leases, through appropriate inspections and enforcement actions as needed to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and respond to concerns expressed by them. We will take immediate action to recover possession from trespassers operating without an agricultural lease, and take other emergency action as needed to preserve the value of the land.

###### § 162.109 What laws, other than these regulations, will apply to agricultural leases granted or approved under this part?

(a) Agricultural leases granted or approved under this part will be subject to federal laws of general applicability and any specific federal statutory requirements that are not incorporated in these regulations.

(b) Tribal laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of the tribe enacting such laws, except to the extent that those tribal laws are inconsistent with these regulations or other applicable federal law. These regulations may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, however, so long as:

(1) The tribal laws are consistent with the enacting tribe's governing documents;

(2) The tribe has notified us of the superseding or modifying effect of the tribal laws;

(3) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate a federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law; and

(4) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to tribal land.

(c) State law may apply to agricultural lease disputes or define the remedies available to the Indian landowners in the event of an agricultural lease violation by the tenant, if the agricultural lease so provides and the Indian landowners have expressly agreed to the application of state law.

###### § 162.110 Can these regulations be administered by tribes, on the Secretary's or on BIA's behalf?

Except insofar as these regulations provide for the granting, approval, or enforcement of agricultural leases and permits, the provisions in these regulations that authorize or require us to take certain actions will extend to any tribe or tribal organization that is administering specific programs or providing specific services under a contract or self-governance compact entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. § 450f).

###### § 162.111 Who owns the records associated with this subpart?

(a) Records associated with this subpart are the property of the United States if they:

(1) Are made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the conduct of a federal trust function under 25 U.S.C. § 450fincluding the operation of a trust program; and

(2) Evidence the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities undertaken in the performance of a federal trust function under this part.

(b) Records associated with this subpart not covered by paragraph (a) of this section that are made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the conduct of business with the Department of the Interior under this subpart are the property of the tribe.

###### § 162.112 How must records associated with this part be preserved?

(a) Any organization, including tribes and tribal organizations, that have records identified in § 162.111(a) must preserve the records in accordance with approved Departmental records retention procedures under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapters 29, 31 and 33. These records and related records management practices and safeguards required under the Federal Records Act are subject to inspection by the Secretary and the Archivist of the United States.

(b) A tribe or tribal organization should preserve the records identified in § 162.111(b) for the period of time authorized by the Archivist of the United States for similar Department of the Interior records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33. If a tribe or tribal organization does not preserve records associated with its conduct of business with the Department of the Interior under this part, it may prevent the tribe or tribal organization from being able to adequately document essential transactions or furnish information necessary to protect its legal and financial rights or those of persons directly affected by its activities.

###### § 162.113 May decisions under this subpart be appealed?

Yes. Except where otherwise provided in this subpart, appeals from decisions by the BIA under this subpart may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR subpart 2.

##### Subpart C - Residential Leases

##### Subpart D - Business Leases

##### Subpart E - Wind and Solar Resource Leases

##### Subpart F - Special Requirements for Certain Reservations

###### § 162.600 Crow Reservation.

(a) Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part 162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80). However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a matter of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general regulations contained in this part 162 shall be applicable. Approval of the Secretary is required on leases signed by Crow Indians not classified as competent or made on inherited or devised trust lands owned by more than five competent devisees or heirs.

(b) The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years, except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years authorized by law.

(c) All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent, under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed. Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved. Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such instrument will be returned without recordation.

(d) Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon discovery of the condition:

(1) The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by all owners of the land described in the lease;

(2) There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of the same term;

(3) The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land utilization plans and conservation practices; or

(4) There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to, erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly endorsed by the lessor.

(e) Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust lands.

(f) Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute as to the amount of such damage, the matter will be referred to the Secretary whose determination will be final as to the amount of said damage.

###### § 162.601 Fort Belknap Reservation.

Not to exceed 20,000 acres of allotted and tribal lands (non-irrigable as well as irrigable) on the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana may be leased for the culture of sugar beets and other crops in rotation for terms not exceeding ten years.

###### § 162.602 Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Reservations, California.

(a) Upon a determination by the Secretary that the owner or owners are not making beneficial use thereof, restricted lands on the Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations which are or may be irrigated from distribution facilities administered by the Coachella Valley County Water District in Riverside County, California, may be leased by the Secretary in accordance with the regulations in this part for the benefit of the owner or owners.

(b) All leases granted or approved on restricted lands of the Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations shall be filed for record in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the land is located, the cost thereof to be paid by the lessee. A copy of each such lease shall be filed by the lessee with the Coachella Valley County Water District or such other irrigation or water district within which the leased lands are located. All such leases shall include a provision that the lessee, in addition to the rentals provided for in the lease, shall pay all irrigation charges properly assessed against the land which became payable during the term of the lease. Act of August 25, 1950 (64 Stat. 470); Act of August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 968).

###### § 162.603 San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations.

(a)The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Arizona, in addition to that contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25 U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in part 162 apply. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 Act does not apply to leases made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining leases on Indian lands.

(b)Leases made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing lease shall not exceed ten years; the term of a farming lease that does not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed ten years; and the term of a farming lease that requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option to renew which extends the total term beyond the maximum term permitted by this section.

(c)Every lease under the 1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property wherever such persons or property may be.

(d)If the Secretary determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of such terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to the authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be submitted.

(e)The regulations in part 162 of this title shall apply to leases made under the 1966 Act except where such regulations are inconsistent with this section.

(f)Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.

##### Subpart G - Records

###### § 162.701 Who owns the records associated with this part?

(a) Records are the property of the United States if they:

(1) Are made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the conduct of a Federal trust function under 25 U.S.C. 450fincluding the operation of a trust program; and

(f) Forest management deductions are to be utilized to perform forest land management activities in accordance with an approved expenditure plan. Expenditure plans shall describe the forest land management activities anticipated to be undertaken, establish a time period for their completion, summarize anticipated obligations and expenditures, and specify the method through which funds are to be transferred or credited to tribal accounts from special deposit accounts established to hold amounts withheld as forest management deductions. Any forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved expenditure plan by the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the deductions are withheld, shall be collected into the general funds of the United States Treasury pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 413.

(1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a written expenditure plan for the use of forest management deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary. The approval of the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes allocation of tribal funds for Indian forest land management activities. Approval of the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall constitute authority for crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected by the Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to the approved expenditure plan for the performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from which the forest management deduction is collected.

(2) Forest management deductions shall be handled in the same manner as described under § 163.25(f)(1) of this part if the expenditure plan approved by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides for the conduct of forest land management activities on Indian forest lands located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation.

(3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for Indians by the United States, forest management deductions may be utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in accordance with an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary.

(g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section shall not be available to cover the costs that are paid from funds appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset federal appropriations for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for management of Indian forest land.

(h) Within 120 days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, tribes shall submit to the Secretary a written report detailing the actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past fiscal year. The Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, books, or other tribal records supporting the report.

(i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available until expended.

(j) As provided in § 163.25(f) of this part, only forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved expenditure plan may be deposited to a U.S. Treasury miscellaneous receipt account. No amount collected as forest management deductions shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest management deductions or fees derived from Indian forest land shall be collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States Treasury.

###### § 163.26 Forest product harvesting permits.

(a) Except as provided in §§ 163.13 and 163.27 of this part, removal of forest products that are not under formal contract, pursuant to § 163.19, shall be under forest product harvesting permit forms approved by the Secretary. Permits will be issued only with the written consent of the beneficial Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest of forest products from Indian forest land, as authorized in § 163.20 of this part. To be valid, permits must be approved by the Secretary. Minimum stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold will be set at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment and bonding requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as appropriate.

(b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated that forest products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for other goods or services. The estimated value which may be harvested in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $5,000. For the purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.

(c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as provided in § 163.25 of this part, may be issued. Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $25,000. For the purpose of issuance of paid permits, individual shall mean an individual or any operating entity comprised of more than one individual.

(d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment to harvest and sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special permit shall include provision for payment by the Indian of forest management deductions pursuant to § 163.25 of this part. Unless waived by the Secretary, the permit shall also require the Indian to make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by § 163.21. Such bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the permit or will be used by the Secretary in his or her discretion for planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused by failure to comply with the provisions of the permit. As a condition to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the Indian shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary that he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the forest products, on terms that will protect the Indian's interests.

###### § 163.27 Free-use harvesting without permits.

With the consent of the beneficial Indian owners and the Secretary, Indians may harvest designated types of forest products from Indian forest land without a permit or contract, and without charge. Forest products harvested under this authority shall be for the Indian's personal use, and shall not be sold or exchanged for other goods or services.

###### § 163.28 Fire management measures.

(a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment, purchase tools and supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an adequate level of readiness to meet normal wildfire protection needs and extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for fighting a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred pursuant to an approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates of pay for fire fighters and for equipment rental shall be the rates for fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a fire occurs, unless there are in effect at the time different rates that have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into reciprocal agreements with any fire organization maintaining protection facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian land for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements for mutual aid in fire protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).

(b) The Secretary is authorized to conduct a wildfire prevention program to reduce the number of person-caused fires and prevent damage to natural resources on Indian land.

(c) The Secretary is authorized to expend funds for emergency rehabilitation measures needed to stabilize soil and watershed on Indian land damaged by wildfire.

(d) Upon consultation with the beneficial Indian owners, the Secretary may use fire as a management tool on Indian land to achieve land and/or resource management objectives.

###### § 163.29 Trespass.

(a) Trespassers will be liable for civil penalties and damages to the enforcement agency and the beneficial Indian owners, and will be subject to prosecution for acts of trespass.

(1)For trespass actions brought in tribal court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this § 163.29 of this part. All other aspects of a tribal trespass prosecution brought under these regulations will be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, unless otherwise prescribed under federal law. Absent applicable tribal or federal law, the measure of damages shall be that prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed.

(2)For trespass actions brought in Federal court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this § 163.29. In the absence of applicable federal law, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law, the law of the state in which it was committed.

(3) Civil penalties for trespass include, but are not limited to:

(i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority injures, severs, or carries off from a reservation any forest product as defined in § 163.1 of this part. Proof of Indian ownership of the premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser are prima facie evidence sufficient to support liability for treble damages, with no requirement to show willfulness or intent. Treble damages shall be based upon the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass.

(ii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land includes, but is not limited to, rehabilitation, reforestation, lost future revenue and lost profits, loss of productivity, and damage to other forest resources.

(iii) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with detection and including all processes through the prosecution and collection of damages, including but not limited to field examination and survey, damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness expenses, demand letters, court costs, and attorney fees.

(iv) Interest calculated at the statutory rate prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law in the amount prescribed by federal law. Where tribal law or federal law does not supply a statutory interest rate, the rate of interest shall be statutory rate upon judgments as prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed. Interest shall be based on treble the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass, and calculated from the date of the trespass until payment is rendered.

(b) Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment or other goods or from forest products damaged or taken in the trespass shall be applied to satisfy civil penalties and other damages identified under § 163.29(a) of this part. After disposition of real and personal property to pay civil penalties and damages resulting from trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the event that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the trespasser result in less than full recovery, civil penalties shall be distributed as follows:

(1) Collection of damages up to the highest stumpage value of the trespass products shall be distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners and any costs and expenses needed to restore the trespass land; or

(2) Collections exceeding the highest stumpage value of the trespass product, but less than full recovery, shall be proportionally distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners, the law enforcement agency, and the cost to restore the trespass land. Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where less than the highest stumpage value of the unprocessed forest products taken in trespass has been recovered.

(c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or who are involved in trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which such owners have a partial interest, shall not receive their beneficial share of any civil penalties and damages collected in consequence of the trespass. Any civil penalties and damages defaulted in consequence of this provision instead shall be distributed first toward restoration of the land subject of the trespass and second toward costs of the enforcement agency in consequence of the trespass, with any remainder to the forest management deduction account of the reservation in which the trespass took place.

(d) Civil penalties and other damages collected under these regulations, except for penalties and damages provided for in §§ 163.29(a)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this part, shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of forest products from the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred.

(e) When a federal official or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part has reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass, such individual may seize and take possession of the forest products involved in the trespass if the products are located on reservation. When forest products are seized, the person seizing the products must at the time of the seizure issue a Notice of Seizure to the possessor or claimant of the forest products. The Notice of Seizure shall indicate the date of the seizure, a description of the forest products seized, the estimated value of forest products seized, an indication of whether the forest products are perishable, and the name and authority of the person seizing the forest products. Where the official initiates seizure under these regulations only, the Notice of Seizure shall further include the statement that any challenge or objection to the seizure shall be exclusively through administrative appeal pursuant to part 2 of title 25, and shall provide the name and the address of the official with whom the appeal may be filed. Alternately, an official may exercise concurrent tribal seizure authority under these regulations using applicable tribal law. In such case, the Notice of Seizure shall identify the tribal law under which the seizure may be challenged, if any. A copy of a Notice of Seizure shall be given to the possessor or claimant at the time of the seizure. If the claimant or possessor is unknown or unavailable, Notice of Seizure shall be posted on the trespass property, and a copy of the Notice shall be kept with any incident report generated by the official seizing the forest products. If the property seized is perishable and will lose substantial value if not sold or otherwise disposed of, the representative of the Secretary, or authorized tribal representative where deferral has been requested, may cause the forest products to be sold. Such sale action shall not be stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal nor by a challenge of the seizure action through a tribal forum. All proceeds from the sale of the forest products shall be placed into an escrow account and held until adjudication or other resolution of the underlying trespass. If it is found that the forest products seized were involved in a trespass, the proceeds shall be applied to the amount of civil penalties and damages awarded. If it is found that a trespass has not occurred or the proceeds are in excess of the amount of the judgment awarded, the proceeds or excess proceeds shall be returned to the possessor or claimant.

(f) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass and that such products have been removed to land not under federal or tribal government supervision, the federal official or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(k) of this part responsible for the trespass shall immediately provide the following notice to the owner of the land or the party in possession of the trespass products:

(1) That such products could be Indian trust property involved in a trespass; and

(2) That removal or disposition of the forest products may result in criminal and/or civil action by the United States or tribe.

(g) A representative of the Secretary or authorized tribal representative pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part will promptly determine if a trespass has occurred. The appropriate representative will issue an official Notice of Trespass to the alleged trespasser and, if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. The Notice is intended to inform the trespasser, buyer, or the processor:

(1) That a determination has been made that a trespass has occurred;

(2) The basis for the determination;

(3) An assessment of the damages, penalties and costs;

(4) Of the seizure of forest products, if applicable; and

(5) That disposition or removal of Indian forest products taken in the trespass may result in civil and/or criminal action by the United States or the tribe.

(h) The Secretary may accept payment of damages in the settlement of civil trespass cases. In the absence of a court order, the Secretary will determine the procedure and approve acceptance of any settlements negotiated by a tribe exercising its concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to § 163.29(j) of this part.

(i) The Secretary may delegate by written agreement or contract, responsibility for detection and investigation of forest trespass.

(j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall have concurrent civil jurisdiction to enforce 25 U.S.C. 3106 and this section against any person.

(1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass, upon:

(i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's adoption of this section; and

(ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including a statement that the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act or a tribal civil rights law that contains provisions for due process and equal protection that are similar to or stronger than those contained in the Indian Civil Rights Act.

(2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass cases as set forth in § 163.29(j)(1) of this part, the Secretary and tribe's authorized representatives will be jointly responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions. The Secretary shall, upon timely request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest trespasses to the tribe. Where said deferral is not requested, the designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall coordinate with the authorized forest trespass official of each tribe the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction as to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in which forums to recommend bringing an action, and promptly provide their recommendation to the Federal officials responsible for initiating and prosecuting forest trespass cases. Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction, but does not request deferral of prosecution, the federal officials responsible for initiating and prosecuting such cases may file and prosecute the action in the tribal court or forum.

(3) The Secretary may rescind an Indian tribe's concurrent civil jurisdiction over trespass cases under this regulation if the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the tribal court has not adhered to the due process or equal protection requirements of the Indian Civil Rights Act. If it is determined that said rescission is justified, the Secretary shall provide written Notice of the rescission, including the findings justifying the rescission and the steps needed to remedy the violations causing the rescission, to the chief judge of the tribal judiciary or other authorized tribal official should there be no chief judge. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary's rescission of concurrent civil jurisdiction shall become final. The affected tribe(s) may appeal a Notice of Rescission under part 2 of title 25.

(4) Nothing shall be construed to prohibit or in any way diminish the authority of a tribe to prosecute individuals under its criminal or civil trespass laws where it has jurisdiction over those individuals.

###### § 163.30 Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products.

(a) In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 415 as amended, the Secretary may request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits designating the Secretary as agent for the landowner and empowering him or her to issue revocable road use and construction permits to users for the purpose of removing forest products.

(b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and con- struction permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual owners when:

(1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis, and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;

(2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or those with an interest therein are unknown so long as the majority of owner(s) of interests whose whereabouts are known, consent to the grant;

(3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest have not been determined, and the Secretary finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any land owner; or

(4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner(s), that cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages.

(b) If the BIA's approval is not required for a permit, these regulations will not apply.

(c) These regulations do not apply to any tribal land which is permitted under a corporate charter issued by us pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 477, or under a special act of Congress authorizing permits without our approval under certain conditions, except to the extent that the authorizing statutes require us to enforce such permits on behalf of the Indian landowners.

(d) To the extent that any provisions of this part conflict with Section 213 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, the provisions of that act will govern.

However, where all of the trust or restricted interests in a tract are subject to a life estate held in fee status, we will approve a permit of the remainder interests of the Indian landowners only if such action is necessary to preserve the value of the land or protect the interests of the Indian landowners. Where a life estate and remainder interest are both owned in trust or restricted status, the life estate and remainder interest must both be permitted under these regulations, unless the permit is for less than one year in duration. Unless otherwise provided by the document creating the life estate or by agreement, rent payable under the permit must be paid to the holder of the life estate under part 179 of this title.

###### § 166.301 How is Indian land for grazing purposes described?

Indian land for grazing purposes should be described by legal description (e.g., aliquot parts, metes and bounds) or other acceptable description. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee status, the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should be identified in the description of the permitted land.

###### § 166.302 How is a range unit created?

We create a range unit after we consult with the Indian landowners of rangeland, by designating units of compatible size, availability, and location.

###### § 166.303 Can more than one parcel of Indian land be combined into one permit?

Yes. A permit may include more than one parcel of Indian land. Permits may include tribal land, individually-owned Indian land, or government land, or any combination thereof.

###### § 166.304 Can there be more than one permit for each range unit?

Yes. There can be more than one permit for each range unit.

###### § 166.305 When is grazing capacity determined?

Before we grant, modify, or approve a permit, in consultation with the Indian landowners, we will establish the total grazing capacity for each range unit based on the summation of each parcel's productivity. We will also establish the season(s) of use on Indian lands.

###### § 166.306 Can the BIA adjust the grazing capacity?

Yes. In consultation with the Indian landowners or in the BIA's discretion based on good cause, we may adjust the grazing capacity using the best evaluation method(s) relevant to the ecological region.

###### § 166.307 Will the grazing capacity be increased if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit?

No. You will not receive an increase in grazing capacity in the permit if you graze trust or non-trust rangeland in common with the permitted land. Grazing capacity will be established only for Indian land covered by your permit.

###### § 166.308 Can the number of animals and/or season of use be modified on the permitted land if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands under an on-and-off grazing permit?

Yes. The number of animals and/or season of use may be modified on permitted Indian land with an on-and-off grazing permit only when a conservation plan includes the use of adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit and when that land is used in common with permitted land.

###### § 166.309 Who determines livestock class and livestock ownership requirements on permitted Indian land?

(a) Tribes determine the class of livestock and livestock ownership requirements for livestock that may be grazed on range units composed entirely of tribal land or which include government land, subject to the grazing capacity prescribed by us under § 166.305 of this part.

###### § 166.702 Can a permit provide for negotiated remedies in the event of a permit violation?

(a) A permit of tribal land may provide the tribe with certain negotiated remedies in the event of a permit violation, including the power to terminate the permit. A permit of individually-owned Indian land may provide the individual Indian landowners with similar remedies, so long as the permit also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners. Any notice of violation must be provided by written notice.

(b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to us under § 166.705(c) of this subpart. If the permit specifically authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for cancellation.

(c) A permit may provide for permit disputes to be resolved in tribal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or through arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to any ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us under § 166.705 of this subpart.

###### § 166.703 What happens if a permit violation occurs?

(a) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific permit violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation within five business days of that notification.

(b) If we determine that a permit violation has occurred based on facts known to us, we will provide written notice to the permittee and the sureties of the violation within five business days.

###### § 166.704 What will a written notice of a permit violation contain?

The written notice of a permit violation will provide the permittee with ten days from the receipt of the written notice to:

(a) Cure the permit violation and notify us that the violation is cured.

(b) Explain why we should not cancel the permit; or

(c) Request in writing additional time to complete corrective actions. If additional time is granted, we may require that certain corrective actions be taken immediately.

###### § 166.705 What will the BIA do if a permit violation is not cured within the required time period?

(a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether:

(1) The permit should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 166.706 through 166.707 of this subpart;

(2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the permit, including collecting on any available bond;

(3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or

(4) The permittee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

(b) If we decide to grant a permittee additional time in which to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time period from the date on which the extension is granted.

(c) If we decide to cancel the permit, we will send the permittee and its sureties a written notice of cancellation within five business days of that decision. We will also provide actual or constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:

(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

(2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest charges, or late payment penalties due under the permit;

(3) Notify the permittee of its right to appeal under Part 2 of this chapter, as modified by § 166.706 of this subpart, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

(4) Order the permittee to vacate the property within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written notice of cancellation, if an appeal is not filed by that time.

###### § 166.706 Will the BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds apply to cancellation decisions involving permits?

(a) The appeal bond provisions in § 2.5 of part 2 of this chapter will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decisions made under § 166.705 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to cancel a permit, we may require the permittee to post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in part 2 of this chapter.

(b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the permit cancellation decision.

###### § 166.707 When will a cancellation of a permit be effective?

A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the permittee files an appeal under § 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of cancellation from us.

###### § 166.708 Can the BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is threatened with immediate, significant, and irreparable harm?

Yes. If a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Indian land during the term of a permit, we will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart I of this part, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Indian landowners, either before or after the emergency action is taken.

###### § 166.709 What will the BIA do if a permittee holds over after the expiration or cancellation of a permit?

If a permittee remains in possession of Indian land after the expiration or cancellation of a permit, we will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the permittee is engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new permit, we will take action to recover possession of the Indian land on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, including the assessment of civil penalties and costs under subpart I of this part.

##### Subpart I - Trespass

(a) The preservation of the forage, the land, and the water resources on the Navajo Reservation, and the building up of those resources where they have deteriorated.

(b) The protection of the interests of the Navajo Indians from the encroachment of unduly aggressive and anti-social individuals who may or may not be members of the Navajo Tribe.

(c) The adjustment of livestock numbers to the carrying capacity of the range in such a manner that the livestock economy of the Navajo Tribe will be preserved.

(d) To secure increasing responsibility and participation of the Navajo people, including tribal participation in all basic policy decisions, in the sound management of one of the Tribe's greatest assets, its grazing lands, and to foster a better relationship and a clearer understanding between the Navajo people and the Federal Government in carrying out the grazing regulations.

(e) The improvement of livestock through proper breeding practices and the maintenance of a sound culling policy. Buck and bull pastures may be established and maintained either on or off the reservation through District Grazing Committee and Central Grazing Committee action.

##### § 167.4 Regulations; scope; exceptions.

The grazing regulations in this part apply to all lands within the boundaries of the Navajo Reservation held in trust by the United States for the Navajo Tribe and all the trust lands hereafter added to the Navajo Reservation.

(c) Upon the request of the District Grazing Committee, Central Grazing Committee and Navajo Tribal Council to the Superintendent; recommendations for future adjustments to the established carrying capacities shall be made by Range Technicians based on the best information available through annual utilization studies and range condition studies analyzed along with numbers of livestock and precipitation data. The recommendations of the Range Technicians shall be submitted to the Superintendent, the Area Director and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

(d) Carrying capacities shall be stated in terms of sheep units yearlong, in the ratio of horses, mules, and burros 1 to 5; cattle 1 to 4; goats 1 to 1. The latter figure in each case denotes sheep units. Sheep, goats, cattle, horses, mules, and burros one year of age or older shall be counted against the carrying capacity.

##### § 167.7 Records.

The District Grazing Committee, the Superintendent, and his authorized representatives shall keep accurate records of all grazing permits and ownership of all livestock. Master files shall be maintained by the Superintendent or his authorized representatives.

(a) The District Grazing Committee shall be responsible for and assist in organizing the sheep and goat dipping and horse and cattle branding program and obtaining the annual live- stock count.

(b) In order to obtain true records of ownership the permittee shall personally appear at the dipping vat or tallying point designated by the Grazing Committee with his or her sheep and goats and at branding and tallying points for cattle and horses. Should the permittee be unable to appear personally he or she shall designate a representative to act for and in his or her behalf. The sheep and goats will be dipped and the cattle and horses will be branded and recorded in the name of the permittee.

(c) The Superintendent shall prepare and keep current a register containing the names of all permittees using the range, the number of each class of stock by age classes grazed annually and the periods during which grazing shall be permitted in each part thereof.

All classes of livestock twelve months of age or over will be counted against range use and permitted number, except that yearling colts will not be counted against permitted numbers on all permits with less than six horses. (Cross Reference § 167.9.)

##### § 167.8 Grazing rights.

(a) The Superintendent shall determine grazing rights of bona fide live-stock owners based on recommendations of District Grazing Committees. Grazing rights shall be recognized for those permittees having ownership records as established in accordance with § 167.7 or who have acquired grazing rights by marriage, inheritance, purchase or division of permits. Whenever the permitted number of sheep units within a district is less than the carrying capacity, new permits to the carrying capacity limit may be granted as provided in § 167.9.

(b) All enrolled members of the Navajo Tribe over 18 years of age are eligible to acquire and hold grazing permits. Minors under 18 years of age can get possession of grazing permits only through inheritance or gift, and in each case Trustees must be appointed by the Tribal Courts to manage the permits and livestock of such minors until they become 18 years of age and can hold grazing permits in their own right.

(c) No person can hold a grazing permit in more than one district on the Navajo Reservation.

(d) Determination of rights to grazing permits involved in cases of divorce, separation, threatened family disruption, and permits of deceased permittees shall be the responsibility of the Navajo Court of Indian Offenses under existing laws, rules, and regulations.

##### § 167.9 Grazing permits.

(a) All livestock grazed on the Navajo Reservation must be covered by an authorized grazing permit issued by the Superintendent based upon the recommendations of the District Grazing Committee. All such grazing permits will be automatically renewed annually until terminated. District Grazing Committees shall act on all grazing permit changes resulting from negotiability within their respective Districts. The number of livestock that may be grazed under each permit shall be the number originally permitted plus or minus any changes as indicated by Transfer Agreements and Court Judgment Orders.

(b) Any permittee who has five or more horses on his current permit will be required to apply any acquired sheep units in classes of stock other than horses. If the purchaser wishes more than his present number of horses, he must have his needs evaluated by the District Grazing Committee. Yearling colts will be counted against permitted number on all permits with six or more horses. Yearling colts will not be counted against permitted number on all permits with less than six horses. In hardship cases the District Grazing Committee may reissue horses removed from grazing permits through negotiability to permit holders who are without sufficient horses on their present permits to meet minimum needs.

(c) No permittee shall be authorized to graze more than ten head of horses or to accumulate a total of over 350 sheep units.

(d) Upon recommendation of the District Grazing Committee and with the approval of the Superintendent, grazing permits may be transferred from one permittee to another in accordance with instructions provided by the Advisory Committee of the Navajo Tribal Council, or may be inherited; provided that the permitted holdings of any individual permittee shall not exceed 350 sheep units or the equivalent thereof. Should inheritance or other acquisition of permits increase the holdings of any permittee to more than 350 sheep units, said permittee shall dispose of all livestock in excess of 350 sheep units not later than November 15 following date of inheritance or other acquisition, and that portion of his or her permit in excess of 350 sheep units within one year from date of inheritance.

(e) By request of a permittee to sublet all or a part of his or her regular grazing permit to a member of his family or to any person who would receive such permit by inheritance, such subletting of permits may be authorized by the District Grazing Committee and the Superintendent or his authorized representative.

##### § 167.10 Special grazing permits.

##### § 167.11 Tenure of grazing permits.

(a) All active regular grazing permits shall be for one year and shall be automatically renewed annually until terminated. Any Navajo eligible to hold a grazing permit as defined in § 167.8 may become a livestock operator by obtaining an active grazing permit through negotiability or inheritance or both.

(b) In many Districts, and portions of all districts, unused grazing permits or portions of grazing permits are beneficial in aiding range recovery. Each District Grazing Committee will handle each matter of unused grazing permit or portions of grazing permits on individual merits. Where ample forage is available operators will be encouraged to fill their permits with livestock or dispose of their unused permits through negotiability. In those areas where forage is in need of rehabilitation permittees will not be encouraged to stock to their permitted numbers until the range has sufficiently recovered to justify the grazing of additional livestock.

##### § 167.12 Grazing fees.

Grazing fees shall not be charged at this time.

##### § 167.13 Trespass.

Failure to comply with this section and with annual lamb buying regulations will be considered as trespass.

##### § 167.15 Control of livestock disease and introduction of livestock.

(a) The District Grazing Committees with the approval of the Superintendent shall require livestock to be dipped, vaccinated, inspected and be restricted in movement when necessary to prevent the introduction and spread of contagious or infectious disease in the economic interest of the Navajo stock owners. Upon the recommendation of the District Grazing Committee livestock shall be dipped annually when such dipping is necessary to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These annual dippings shall be completed on or before September 1st each year. Livestock, however, may be dipped at other times when necessary.

(a) This part is intended to streamline the procedures and conditions under which BIA will consider a request to approve (grant) rights-of-way over and across tribal lands, individually owned Indian lands, and BIA lands, by providing for the use of the broad authority under 25 U.S.C. 323&#x2013;328, rather than the limited authorities under other statutes. This part is also intended to support tribal self-determination and self-governance by acknowledging and incorporating tribal law and policies in processing a request for a right-of-way across tribal lands and defer to the maximum extent possible to Indian landowner decisions regarding their Indian land.

(b) This part specifies:

(1) Conditions and authorities under which we will consider a request to approve rights-of-way over or across Indian land;

(2) How to obtain a right-of-way;

(4) How we administer and enforce rights-of-ways;

(5) How to renew, amend, assign, and mortgage rights-of-way; and

(6) Whether rights-of-way are required for service line agreements.

(c) This part does not cover rights-of-way over or across tribal lands within a reservation for the purpose of Federal Power Act projects, such as constructing, operating, or maintaining dams, water conduits, reservoirs, powerhouses, transmission lines, or other works which must constitute a part of any project for which a license is required by the Federal Power Act.

(1) The Federal Power Act provides that any license that must be issued to use tribal lands within a reservation must be subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such lands (16 U.S.C. 797(e)).

(2) In the case of tribal lands belonging to a tribe organized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. 476), the Federal Power Act requires that annual charges for the use of such tribal lands under any license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must be subject to the approval of the tribe (16 U.S.C. 803(e)).

##### Subpart B - Service Line Agreements

###### § 169.51 Is a right-of-way required for service lines?

Service lines generally branch off from facilities for which a right-of-way must be obtained. A service line is a utility line running from a main line, transmission line, or distribution line that is used only for supplying telephone, water, electricity, gas, internet service, or other utility service to a house, business, or other structure. In the case of a power line, a service line is limited to a voltage of 14.5 kv or less, or a voltage of 34.5 kv or less if serving irrigation pumps and commercial and industrial uses. To obtain access to Indian land for service lines, the right-of-way grantee must file a service line agreement meeting the requirements of this subpart with BIA.

###### § 169.52 What is a service line agreement?

Service line agreements are agreements signed by a utility provider and landowners for the purpose of providing limited access to supply the owners (or authorized occupants or users) of one tract of tribal or individually owned Indian land with utilities for use by such owners (or occupants or users) on the premises.

###### § 169.53 What should a service line agreement address?

A service line agreement should address what utility services the provider will supply, to whom, and other appropriate details. The service line agreement should also address the mitigation of any damages incurred during construction and the restoration (or reclamation, if agreed to by the owners or authorized occupants or users) of the premises at the termination of the agreement.

###### § 169.54 What are the consent requirements for service line agreements?

(a) Before the utility provider may begin any work to construct service lines across tribal land, the utility provider and the tribe (or the legally authorized occupants or users of the tribal land and upon request, the tribe) must execute a service line agreement.

(b) Before the utility provider may begin any work to construct service lines across individually owned land, the utility provider and the owners (or the legally authorized occupants or users) must execute a service line agreement.

###### § 169.55 Is a valuation required for service line agreements?

We do not require a valuation for service line agreements.

###### § 169.56 Must I file service line agreements with the BIA?

The parties must file an executed copy of service line agreements, together with a plat or diagram, with us within 30 days after the date of execution for recording in the LTRO. The plat or diagram must show the boundary of the ownership parcel and point of connection of the service line with the distribution line. When the plat or diagram is placed on a separate sheet it must include the signatures of the parties.

(b) The tribe must record right-of-way documents for the following types of rights-of-way in the LTRO with jurisdiction over the affected Indian lands, even though BIA approval is not required:

(1) Grants on tribal land for a tribal utility under § 169.4;

(2) Grants on tribal land under a special act of Congress authorizing grants without our approval under certain conditions.

###### § 169.303 What happens if BIA denies a right-of-way document?

If we deny the right-of-way grant, renewal, amendment, assignment, or mortgage, we will notify the parties immediately and advise the landowners and the applicant of their right to appeal the decision under part 2 of this chapter.

###### § 169.304 What happens if BIA does not meet a deadline for issuing a decision on a right-of-way document?

(g) The provisions of 25 CFR 2.8 do not apply to the inaction of BIA officials with respect to a granting or denying a right-of-way, renewal, amendment, assignment, or mortgage under this subpart.

###### § 169.305 Will BIA require an appeal bond for an appeal of a decision on a right-of-way document?

(a) If a party appeals our decision on a right-of-way document, then the official to whom the appeal is made may require the appellant to post an appeal bond in accordance with part 2 of this chapter. We will not require an appeal bond if the tribe is a party to the appeal and requests a waiver of the appeal bond.

(b) The appellant may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The appellant may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

(b) The tribe with jurisdiction may investigate compliance consistent with tribal law.

###### § 169.403 May a right-of-way provide for negotiated remedies?

(a) The tribe and the grantee on tribal land may negotiate remedies for a violation, abandonment, or non-use. The negotiated remedies must be stated in the tribe's consent to the right-of-way grant, which BIA will then incorporate into the grant itself. The negotiated remedies may include, but are not limited to, the power to terminate the right-of-way grant. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:

(1) BIA approval of the termination is not required;

(2) The termination is effective without BIA cancellation; and

(3) The tribe must provide us with written notice of the termination so that we may record it in the LTRO.

(b) The Indian landowners and the grantee to a right-of-way grant on individually owned Indian land may negotiate remedies, so long as the consent also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners of the majority interest under § 169.107. If the negotiated remedies provide one or both parties with the power to terminate the grant:

(1) BIA concurrence with the termination is required to ensure that the Indian landowners of the applicable percentage of interests have consented; and

(2) BIA will record the termination in the LTRO.

(c) The parties must notify any surety of any violation that may result in termination and the termination of a right-of-way.

(d) Negotiated remedies may apply in addition to, or instead of, the cancellation remedy available to us, as specified in the right-of-way grant. The landowners may request our assistance in enforcing negotiated remedies.

(e) A right-of-way grant may provide that violations will be addressed by a tribe, and that disputes will be resolved by a tribal court, any other court of competent jurisdiction, or by a tribal governing body in the absence of a tribal court, or through an alternative dispute resolution method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to ongoing actions or proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to us.

###### § 169.404 What will BIA do about a violation of a right-of-way grant?

(a) In the absence of actions or proceedings described in § 169.403 (negotiated remedies), or if it is not appropriate for us to defer to the actions or proceedings, we will follow the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. We will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communicate with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether a violation has occurred.

(b) If we determine there has been a violation of the conditions of a grant, other than a violation of payment provisions covered by paragraph (c) of this section, we will promptly send the grantee a written notice of violation.

(1) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

(2) The notice of violation will advise the grantee that, within 10 business days of the receipt of a notice of violation, the grantee must:

(i) Cure the violation and notify us, and the tribe for tribal land, in writing that the violation has been cured;

(ii) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred; or

(iii) Request additional time to cure the violation.

(3) The notice of violation may order the grantee to cease operations under the right-of-way grant.

(c) A grantee's failure to pay compensation in the time and manner required by a right-of-way grant is a violation, and we will issue a notice of violation in accordance with this paragraph.

(1) We will send the grantees a written notice of violation promptly following the date on which the payment was due.

(2) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to the Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

(3) The notice of violation will require the grantee to provide adequate proof of payment.

(d) The grantee will continue to be responsible for the obligations in the grant until the grant expires, or is terminated or cancelled, as well as any reclamation or other obligations that survive the end of the grant.

###### § 169.405 What will BIA do if the grantee does not cure a violation of a right-of-way grant on time?

(a) If the grantee does not cure a violation of a right-of-way grant within the required time period, or provide adequate proof of payment as required in the notice of violation, we will consult with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communicate with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, and determine whether:

(1) We should cancel the grant;

(2) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the grant;

(3) We should invoke other remedies available under the grant or applicable law, including collection on any available bond or, for failure to pay compensation, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or

(4) The grantee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

(b) Following consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, communication with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land, we may take action to recover unpaid compensation and any associated late payment charges.

(2) We may take action to recover any unpaid compensation even though we cancel the grant.

(c) If we decide to cancel the grant, we will send the grantee a cancellation letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 5 business days of our decision. We will send a copy of the cancellation letter to the tribe for tribal land, and will provide Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land with actual notice of the cancellation. The cancellation letter will:

(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

(2) If applicable, notify the grantee of the amount of any unpaid compensation or late payment charges due under the grant;

(3) Notify the grantee of the grantee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, including the possibility that the official to whom the appeal is made may require the grantee to post an appeal bond;

(4) Order the grantee to vacate the property within the timeframe reflected in the termination terms of the grant, or within 31 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, or within such longer period of time in extraordinary circumstances considering the protection of trust resources and the best interest of the Indian landowners, if an appeal is not filed by that time; and

(5) Order the grantee to take any other action BIA deems necessary to protect the Indian land.

(d) We may invoke any other remedies available to us under the grant, including collecting on any available bond, and the Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under tribal law.

###### § 169.408 What is the process for cancelling a right-of-way for non-use or abandonment?

(a) We may cancel, in whole or in part, any rights-of-way granted under this part 30 days after mailing written notice to the grantee at its latest address, for a nonuse of the right-of-way for a consecutive 2-year period for the purpose for which it was granted. If the grantee fails to correct the basis for cancellation by the 30th day after we mailed the notice, we will issue an appropriate instrument cancelling the right-of-way and transmit it to the LTRO pursuant to part 150 of this chapter for recording and filing.

(b) We may cancel, in whole or in part, any rights-of-way granted under this part immediately upon abandonment of the right-of-way by the grantee. We will issue an appropriate instrument cancelling the right-of-way and transmit it to the LTRO pursuant to part 150 of this chapter for recording and filing.

(c) The cancellation notice will notify the grantee of the grantee's right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, including the possibility of that the official to whom the appeal is made will require the grantee to post an appeal bond.

###### § 169.409 When will a cancellation of a right-of-way grant be effective?

When a cancellation decision is not immediately effective, the grantee must continue to pay compensation and comply with the other terms of the grant.

###### § 169.410 What will BIA do if a grantee remains in possession after a right-of-way expires or is terminated or cancelled?

If a grantee remains in possession after the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a right-of-way, and is not accessing the land to perform reclamation or other remaining grant obligations, we may treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass under applicable law and will communicate with the Indian landowners in making the determination whether to treat the unauthorized possession as a trespass. Unless the parties have notified us in writing that they are engaged in good faith negotiations to renew or obtain a new right-of-way, we may take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law, such as a forcible entry and detainer action. The holdover time will be charged against the new term.

###### § 169.411 Will BIA appeal bond regulations apply to cancellation decisions involving right-of-way grants?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appeal bond provisions in part 2 of this chapter will govern appeals from right-of-way cancellation decisions.

(b) The grantee may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The grantee may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the appeal bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.

###### § 169.412 When will BIA issue a decision on an appeal from a right-of-way decision?

BIA will issue a decision on an appeal from a right-of-way decision within 60 days of receipt of all pleadings.

If an individual or entity takes possession of, or uses, Indian land or BIA land without a right-of-way and a right-of-way is required, the unauthorized possession or use is a trespass. An unauthorized use within an existing right-of-way is also a trespass. We may take action to recover possession, including eviction, on behalf of the Indian landowners and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law. The Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under applicable law, including applicable tribal law.

###### § 169.414 May BIA take emergency action if Indian land is threatened?

(a) We may take appropriate emergency action if there is a natural disaster or if an individual or entity causes or threatens to cause immediate and significant harm to Indian land or BIA land.

(b) We will make reasonable efforts to notify the individual Indian landowners before and after taking emergency action on Indian land. In all cases, we will notify the Indian landowners after taking emergency action on Indian land. We will provide written notification of our action to the Indian tribe exercising jurisdiction over the Indian land before and after taking emergency action on Indian land.

###### § 169.415 How will BIA conduct compliance and enforcement when there is a life estate on the tract?

(a) We may monitor the use of the land, as appropriate, and will enforce the terms of the right-of-way on behalf of the owners of the remainder interests, but will not be responsible for enforcing the right-of-way on behalf of the life tenant.

(b) The life tenant may not cause or allow permanent injury to the land.

#### PART 170 - TRIBAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

##### Subpart A - Policies, Applicability, and Definitions

###### § 170.1 What does this part do?

This part provides rules and references to the statutory funding formula for the Department of the Interior (DOI), in cooperation with the Department of Transportation (DOT), to implement the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP). Included in this part are references to other title 23 and title 25 transportation programs administered by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) and the Secretary of Transportation (together, the “Secretaries”) and implemented by Tribes and Consortiums in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, FHWA program agreements, and other appropriate agreements.

###### § 170.2 What policies govern the TTP?

(a) The Secretaries' policy for the TTP is to:

(1) Provide a uniform and consistent set of rules;

(2) Foster knowledge of the programs by providing information about them and the opportunities that they create;

(3) Facilitate Tribal planning, conduct, and administration of the programs;

(4) Encourage inclusion of these programs under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements;

(5) Make available all contractible non-inherently Federal administrative functions under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements; and

(6) Carry out policies, procedures, and practices in consultation with Indian Tribes to ensure the letter, spirit, and goals of Federal transportation programs are fully implemented.

(b) Where this part differs from provisions in the ISDEAA, this part should advance the policy of increasing Tribal autonomy and discretion in program operation.

(c) This part is designed to enable Indian Tribes to participate in all contractible activities of the TTP. The Secretaries will afford Indian Tribes the flexibility, information, and discretion to design transportation programs under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements to meet the needs of their communities consistent with this part.

(d) Programs, functions, services, and activities, regardless of how they are administered, are an exercise of Indian Tribes' self-determination and self-governance.

(1) The Tribe is responsible for managing the day-to-day operation of its contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities.

(2) The Tribe accepts responsibility and accountability to the beneficiaries under self-determination contracts, self-governance agreements, program agreements, and other appropriate agreements for:

(i) Use of the funds; and

(ii) Satisfactory performance of all activities funded under the contract or agreement.

(3) The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of Tribes and the trust resources of individual Indians.

(e) The Secretary should interpret Federal laws and regulations to facilitate including programs covered by this part in the government-to-government agreements authorized under ISDEAA.

(f) The administrative functions referenced in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are contractible without regard to the organizational level within the DOI that carries out these functions. Including TTP administrative functions under self-determination contracts, self- governance agreements, program agreements or other appropriate agreements, does not limit or reduce the funding for any program or service serving any other Tribe.

(g) The Secretaries are not required to reduce funding for a Tribe under these programs to make funds available to another Tribe.

(h) This part must be liberally construed for the benefit of Tribes and to implement the Federal policy of self-determination and self-governance.

(i) Any ambiguities in this part must be construed in favor of the Tribes to facilitate and enable the transfer of programs authorized by 23 U.S.C. 201 and 202 and title 25 of the U.S.C.

###### § 170.3 When do other requirements apply to the TTP?

TTP policies, guidance, and directives apply, to the extent permitted by law, only if they are consistent with this part and 25 CFR parts 900 and 1000. See 25 CFR 900.5 for when a Tribe must comply with other unpublished requirements.

###### § 170.4 How does this part affect existing Tribal rights?

This part does not:

(a) Affect Tribes' sovereign immunity from suit;

(b) Terminate or reduce the trust responsibility of the United States to Tribes or individual Indians;

##### Subpart B - Tribal Transportation Program Policy and Eligibility

##### Subpart C - Tribal Transportation Program Funding

###### § 170.200 How do BIA and FHWA determine the TTP funding amount?

23 U.S.C. 202(b)(3)(A) provides the basis for the funding formula and its transition into use. The annual TTP funding amount available for distribution is determined as follows:

(a) The following set-asides are applied to the Tribal transportation program before the determination of final Tribal shares:

(1) Tribal transportation planning (23 U.S.C. 202(c));

(2) Tribal transportation facility bridges (23 U.S.C. 202(d));

(3) Tribal safety (23 U.S.C 202(e));

(4) Administrative expenses (23 U.S.C 202(a)(6)); and

(5) Tribal supplemental program (23 U.S.C. 202(b)(3)(C)).

(b) After deducting the set asides identified in paragraph (a) of this section, on October 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretaries will distribute the remainder authorized to be appropriated for the TTP among Indian Tribes as follows:

(1) For fiscal year 2016 and thereafter:

(i) For each Indian Tribe, 20 percent of the total relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor as determined by the Tribal Transportation Allocation Methodology (see 25 CFR 170 dated July 19, 2004)) for the fiscal year 2011 funding amount made available to that Indian Tribe; and

(ii) The remainder using Tribal shares as described in § 170.201 and Tribal supplemental funding as described in § 170.202.

(2) [Reserved]

###### § 170.201 What is the statutory distribution formula for Tribal shares?

(a) Tribal shares are determined by using the NTTFI as calculated for fiscal year 2012, and the most recent data on American Indian and Alaska Native population within each Indian Tribe's American Indian/Alaska Native Reservation or Statistical Area, as computed under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101), in the following manner:

(1) 27 percent in the ratio that the total eligible road mileage in each Tribe bears to the total eligible road mileage of all American Indians and Alaskan Natives. For the purposes of this calculation, eligible road mileage will be computed using only facilities included in the inventory described below:

(i) Were included in the BIA System Inventory prior to October 1, 2004;

(ii) Are owned by an Indian Tribal government;

(iii) Are owned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

(2) 39 percent in the ratio that the total population in each Tribe bears to the total population of all American Indians and Alaskan Natives; and

(3) 34 percent will be initially divided equally among each BIA Region.

(b) The share of funds will be distributed to each Indian Tribe within the BIA Region in the ratio that the average total relative need distribution factors and population adjustment factors from fiscal years 2005 through 2011 for a Tribe bears to the average total of relative need distribution factors and population adjustment factors for fiscal years 2005 through 2011 in that region.

###### § 170.202 How do BIA and FHWA determine and distribute the Tribal supplemental program funds?

(a) The total amount of funding made available for the Tribal supplemental program is determined as follows:

(1) If the amount made available for the TTP is less than or equal to $275,000,000, the Tribal supplemental funding amount will equal 30 percent of such amount.

(2) If the amount made available for the TTP exceeds $275,000,000, the Tribal supplemental funding will equal:

(i) $82,500,000; plus

(ii) 12.5 percent of the amount made available for the Tribal transportation program in excess of $275,000,000.

(b) The Tribal supplemental program funds will be distributed as follows:

(1) Initially, the Tribal supplemental program funding determined in paragraph (a) of this section will be designated among the BIA Regions in proportion to the regional total of Tribal shares based on the cumulative Tribal shares of all Indian Tribes within the region under § 170.201.

(2) After paragraph (b)(1) of this section is completed, the Tribal supplemental program funding designated for each region will be distributed among the Tribes within the region as follows:

(i) The Secretaries will determine which Tribes would be entitled under § 170.200 to receive in a fiscal year less funding than they would receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C (in effect as of July 5, 2012); and

(ii) The combined amount that such Indian Tribes would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to such relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor in excess of the amount that they would be entitled to receive in the fiscal year under § 170.200.

(c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretaries will distribute a combined amount to each Tribe that meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section a share of funding in proportion to the share of the combined amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section attributable to such Indian Tribe.

(d) A Tribe may not receive under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and based on its Tribal share under § 170.200 a combined amount that exceeds the amount that such Indian Tribe would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C.

(e) If the amount made available for a region under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds the amount distributed among Indian Tribes within that region under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, The Secretaries will distribute the remainder of such region's funding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section among all Tribes in that region in proportion to the combined amount that each such Tribe received under § 170.200 and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

###### § 170.203 How are Tribal transportation planning funds provided to Tribes?

##### Subpart B - How To Acquire Leases

###### § 211.20 Leasing procedures.

(a) Indian mineral owners may, with the approval of the superintendent or area director, lease their land for mining purposes. No oil and gas lease shall be approved unless it has first been offered for bidding at an advertised lease sale in accordance with this section. Leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section unless the Secretary grants the Indian mineral owners written permission to negotiate for lease. Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over the lands.

(b) Indian mineral owners may request that the Secretary prepare and advertise or negotiate (if the requirements of this section have been met) mineral leases on their behalf. If requested by an applicant interested in acquiring rights to Indian-owned minerals, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Indian mineral owner, and advise the owner in writing of the alternatives available, including the right to decline to lease. If the Indian mineral owner decides to have the leases advertised, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner concerning the appropriate royalty rate and rental. The Secretary may then undertake the responsibility to advertise and lease in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements of lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate superintendent or area director for future reference.

(2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to the responsible bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary, after consultation with the Indian mineral owner, shall establish the rental and royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and shall not be subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that acceptance of the lease bid by the Indian mineral owner is required.

(3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that bid is not accepted.

(4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.

(5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall also file the lease in completed form at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.

(6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete all requirements necessary for the approval of the lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-advertise the lease for sale, or, subject to the consent of the Indian mineral owner, the lease may be let through private negotiations.

(c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained.

(d) The Indian mineral owner may also submit negotiated leases to the Secretary for review and approval.

###### § 211.21 [Reserved]

###### § 211.22 Leases for subsurface storage of oil or gas.

(a) The Secretary, with the consent of the Indian mineral owners, may approve storage leases, or modifications, amendments, or extensions of existing leases, on Indian lands to provide for the subsurface storage of oil or gas, irrespective of the lands from which production is initially obtained. The storage lease, or modification, amendment, or extension to an existing lease, shall provide for the payment of such storage fee or rental on such oil or gas as may be determined adequate in each case, or, in lieu thereof, for a royalty other than that prescribed in the oil and gas lease when such stored oil and gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced.

(b) The Secretary, with consent of the Indian mineral owners, may approve a provision in an oil and gas lease under which storage of oil and gas is authorized, for continuance of the lease at least for the period of such storage use and so long thereafter as oil or gas not previously produced is produced in paying quantities.

(c) Applications for subsurface storage of oil or gas shall be filed in triplicate with the authorized officer and shall disclose the ownership of the lands involved, the parties in interest, the storage fee, rental, or royalty offered to be paid for such storage, and all essential information showing the necessity for such project. Enough copies of the final agreement signed by the Indian mineral owners and other parties in interest shall be submitted for the approval of the Secretary to permit retention of five copies by the Department after approval.

###### § 211.23 Corporate qualifications and requests for information.

(a) The signing in a representative capacity and delivery of bids, geological and geophysical permits, mineral leases, or assignments, bonds, or other instruments required by the regulations in this part constitutes certification that the individual signing (except a surety agent) is authorized to act in such capacity. An agent for a surety shall furnish a power of attorney.

(b) A corporate applicant proposing to acquire an interest in a permit or lease shall have on file with the superintendent or area director a statement showing:

(1) The State(s) in which the corporation is incorporated, and that the corporation is authorized to hold such interests in the State where the land described in the instrument is situated; and

(2) A notarized statement that the corporation has power to conduct all business and operations as described in the lease or permit.

(c) The Secretary may, either before or after the approval of a permit, mineral lease, assignment, or bond, call for any reasonable additional information necessary to carry out the regulations in this part, or other applicable laws and regulations.

###### § 211.24 Bonds.

(a) The lessee, permittee or prospective lessee acquiring a lease, or any interest therein, by assignment shall furnish with each lease, permit or assignment a surety bond or personal bond in an amount sufficient to ensure compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the lease(s), permit(s), or assignment(s) and the statutes and regulations applicable to the lease, permit, or assignment. Surety bonds shall be issued by a qualified company approved by the Department of the Treasury (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570).

(b) An operator may file a $75,000 bond for all geothermal, mining, or oil and gas leases, permits, or assignments in any one State, which may also include areas on that part of an Indian reservation extending into any contiguous State. Statewide bonds are subject to approval in the discretion of the Secretary.

(c) An operator may file a $150,000 bond for full nationwide coverage to cover all geothermal or oil and gas leases, permits, or assignments without geographic or acreage limitation to which the operator is or may become a party. Nationwide bonds are subject to approval in the discretion of the Secretary.

(d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by:

(1) Certificate of deposit issued by a financial institution, the deposits of which are federally insured, explicitly granting the Secretary full authority to demand immediate payment in case of default in the performance of the provisions and conditions of the lease or permit. The certificate shall explicitly indicate on its face that Secretarial approval is required prior to redemption of the certificate of deposit by any party;

(2) Cashier's check;

(3) Certified check;

(4) Negotiable Treasury securities of the United States of a value equal to the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury securities shall be accompanied by a proper conveyance to the Secretary of full authority to sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the provisions and conditions of a lease or permit; or

(5) Letter of credit issued by a financial institution authorized to do business in the United States and whose deposits are federally insured, and identifying the Secretary as sole payee with full authority to demand immediate payment in the case of default in the performance of the provisions and conditions of a lease or permit.

(i) The letter of credit shall be irrevocable during its term.

(ii) The letter of credit shall be payable to the Bureau of Indian Affairs upon demand, in part or in full, upon receipt from the Secretary of a notice of attachment stating the basis thereof (e.g., default in compliance with the lease or permit provisions and conditions or failure to file a replacement in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section).

(iii) The initial expiration date of the letter of credit shall be at least one (1) year following the date it is filed in the proper Bureau of Indian Affairs office.

(iv) The letter of credit shall contain a provision for automatic renewal for periods of not less than one (1) year in the absence of notice to the proper Bureau of Indian Affairs office at least ninety (90) days prior to the originally stated or any extended expiration date.

(v) A letter of credit used as security for any lease or permit upon which operations have taken place and final approval for abandonment has not been given, or as security for a statewide or nationwide bond, shall be forfeited and shall be collected by the Secretary if not replaced by other suitable bond or letter of credit at least thirty (30) days before its expiration date.

(e) The required amount of bonds may be increased in any particular case at the discretion of the Secretary.

###### § 211.25 Acreage limitation.

A lessee may acquire more than one lease but no single lease shall be granted for mineral leasing purposes on Indian tribal or restricted lands in excess of the following acreage except where the rule of approximation applies:

(a) Leases for oil and gas and all other minerals except coal are to be contained within one United States Governmental survey section of land and shall be described by legal subdivisions including lots or tract equivalents not to exceed 640 acres; in instances of irregular surveys, including lands not surveyed under the United States Governmental survey, lands shall be considered in multiples of 40 acres or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof;

(b) Leases for coal shall ordinarily be limited to 2,560 acres in a reasonably compact form and shall be described by legal subdivisions including lots or tract equivalents. In instances of irregular surveys, including lands not surveyed under the United States Governmental survey, lands shall be considered in multiples of 40 acres or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof. The Secretary may, upon application and with the consent of the Indian mineral owner, approve the issuance of a single lease for more than 2,560 acres, in a reasonably compact form, upon a finding that the issuance is in the best interest of the lessor.

###### § 211.26 [Reserved]

###### § 211.27 Duration of leases.

(a) All leases shall be for a term not to exceed a primary term of lease duration of ten (10) years and, absent specific lease provisions to the contrary, shall continue as long thereafter as the minerals specified in the lease are produced in paying quantities. Absent specific lease provisions to the contrary, all provisions in leases governing their duration shall be measured from the date of approval by the Secretary.

(b) An oil and gas or geothermal resource lease which stipulates that it shall continue in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of lease duration (“commencement clause”) if drilling operations have commenced during the primary term, shall be valid and shall hold the lease beyond the primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee has commenced actual drilling by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease with a drilling rig designed to reach the total proposed depth, and drilling is continued with reasonable diligence until the well is completed to production or abandoned. However, in no case shall such drilling hold the lease longer than 120 days past the primary term of lease duration without actual production of oil, gas, or geothermal resources.that this extension does not allow a lease to continue past the 10-year statutory limitation. Drilling which meets the requirements of this section and occurs within a unit or communitization agreement to which the lease is committed shall be considered as if it occurs on the leasehold itself. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will control.

(c) A solid minerals lease which stipulates that it shall continue in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of lease duration if mining operations have commenced during the primary term (commencement clause), shall be valid and hold the lease beyond the primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee has by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease commenced actual removal of mineral materials intended for sale and upon which royalties will be paid. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will control.

###### § 211.28 Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

(a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of agreements that allocate costs and benefits.

(b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is specifically required in the lease. However, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner prior to making a determination concerning a cooperative agreement or well spacing plan.

(c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be filed with the superintendent or area director.

(d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice requirement.

(e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.

(f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved before the lease expiration date.

(g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be effective on the date the agreement is effective.

(h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program approved by the authorized officer.

###### § 211.29 Exemption of leases and permits made by organized tribes.

The regulations in this part may be superseded by the provisions of any tribal constitution, bylaw or charter issued pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461&#x2013;479), the Alaska Act of May 1, 1936 (49 Stat. 1250; 48 U.S.C. 362,258a), or the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967; 25 U.S.C., and Sup., 501&#x2013;509), or by ordinance, resolution, or other action authorized under such constitution, bylaw or charter; Provided, that such tribal law may not supersede the requirements of Federal statutes applicable to Indian mineral leases. The regulations in this part, in so far as they are not so superseded, shall apply to leases and permits made by organized tribes if the validity of the lease or permit depends upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

##### Subpart C - Rents, Royalties, Cancellations and Appeals

###### § 211.40 Manner of payments.

Unless otherwise specifically provided for in a lease, once production has been established, all payments shall be made to the MMS or such other party as may be designated, and shall be made at such time as provided in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. Prior to production, all bonus and rental payments, shall be made to the superintendent or area director.

###### § 211.41 Rentals and production royalty on oil and gas leases.

(a) A lessee shall pay, in advance, beginning with the effective date of the lease, an annual rental of $2.00 per acre or fraction of an acre or such other greater amount as prescribed in the lease. This rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.

(b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less than 16&#x2013;percent of the amount or value of production produced and sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area director if the approving official is the superintendent and by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the area director.

(c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.

(d) If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's risk at all times.

###### § 211.42 Annual rentals and expenditures for development on leases other than oil and gas, and geothermal resources.

(a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, a lease for minerals other than oil, gas and geothermal resources shall provide for a yearly development expenditure of not less than $20 per acre. All such leases shall provide for a rental payment of not less than $2.00 for each acre or fraction of an acre payable on or before the first day of each lease year.

(b) Within twenty (20) days after the lease year, an itemized statement, in duplicate, of the expenditure for development under a lease for minerals other than oil and gas shall be filed with the superintendent or area director. The lessee must certify the statement under oath.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the minimum rates for leases of minerals other than oil and gas shall be as follows:

(1) For substances other than coal, the royalty rate shall be 10 percent of the value of production produced and sold from the lease at the nearest shipping point.

(2) For coal to be strip or open pit mined the royalty rate shall be 12percent of the value of production produced and sold from the lease, and for coal removed from an underground mine, the royalty rate shall be 8 percent of the value of production produced and sold from the lease.

(3) For geothermal resources, the royalty rate shall be 10 percent of the amount or value of steam, or any other form of heat or energy derived from production of geothermal resources under the lease and sold or utilized by the lessee. In addition, the royalty rate shall be 5 percent of the value of any byproduct derived from production of geothermal resources under the lease and sold or utilized or reasonably susceptible of sale or utilization by the lessee, except that the royalty for any mineral byproduct shall be governed by the appropriate paragraph of this section.

(b) A lower royalty rate shall be allowed if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Approval of a lower rate may only be granted by the area director if the approving official is the superintendent or by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, if the approving official is the area director.

###### § 211.44 Suspension of operations.

(a) After the expiration of the primary term of the lease the Secretary may approve suspension of operations for remedial purposes which are necessary for continued production, to protect the resource, the environment, or for other good reasons.that such remedial operations are conducted in accordance with 43 CFR part 3160, subpart 3165 and under such stipulations and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary and are conducted with reasonable diligence. Any suspension shall not relieve the lessee from liability for the payment of rental and other payments as required by lease provisions.

(b) An application for permission to suspend operations or production for economic or marketing reasons on a lease capable of production after the expiration of the primary term of lease duration must be accompanied by the written consent of the Indian mineral owner, an economic analysis, and an executed amendment by the parties to the lease setting forth the provisions pertaining to the suspension of operations and production. Such application shall be treated as a negotiated change to lease provisions, and as such, shall be subject to review and approval by the Secretary.

###### § 211.45 [Reserved]

###### § 211.46 Inspection of premises, books and accounts.

Lessees shall allow the Indian mineral owner, the Indian mineral owner's representatives, or any authorized representative of the Secretary to enter all parts of the leased premises for the purpose of inspection and audit. Lessees shall keep a full and correct account of all operations and submit all related reports required by the lease and applicable regulations. Books and records shall be available for inspection during regular business hours.

(d) If a lessee requests to surrender an entire lease or an entire undivided portion of a lease document, the lessee must deliver to the superintendent or area director the original lease documents;that where the request is made by an assignee to whom no copy of the lease was delivered, the assignee must deliver to the superintendent or area director only its copy of the assignment;

(e) If the lease (or a portion thereof being surrendered) is owned in undivided interests, all lessees owning undivided interests in the lease must join in the request for surrender;

(f) No part of any advance rental shall be refunded to the lessee, nor shall any subsequent surrender or termination of a lease relieve the lessee of the obligation to pay advance rental if advance rental became due prior to the date the request for surrender was received by the superintendent or area director;

(g) If oil, gas, or geothermal resources are being drained from the leased premises by a well or wells located on lands not included in the lease, the Secretary reserves the right, prior to acceptance of the surrender, to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to protect the interests of the Indian mineral owners of the lands surrendered. Such terms and conditions may include payment of compensatory royalty for any drainage; and

(h) Upon expiration or surrender of a solid mineral lease the lessee shall deliver the leased premises in a condition conforming to the approved reclamation plan. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, the machinery necessary to operate the mine is the property of the lessee. However, the machinery may not be removed from the leased premises without the written permission of the Secretary.

###### § 211.52 Fees.

Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each permit, lease, sublease, or other contract, or assignment, thereof shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $75.00 at the time of filing.

###### § 211.53 Assignments, overriding royalties, and operating agreements.

(a) Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Secretary. The Indian mineral owner must also consent if approval of the Indian mineral owner is required in the lease. If consent is not required, then the Secretary shall notify the Indian mineral owner of the proposed assignment. To obtain the approval of the Secretary the assignee must be qualified to hold the lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease.

(b) No lease or interest therein or the use of such lease shall be assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary.

(c) Assignments of leases, and stipulations modifying the provisions of existing leases, which stipulations are also subject to the approval of the Secretary, shall be filed with the superintendent within five (5) working days after the date of execution. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds by the assignee the Secretary may permit the release of any bonds executed by the assignor. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds the assignee accepts all the assignor's responsibilities and prior obligations and liabilities of the assignor (including but not limited to any underpaid royalties and rentals) under the lease.

(d) Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production shall not be considered as interests in the leases as such provision is used in this section. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating operators are hereby authorized and the approval of the Secretary shall not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be subject to the condition that nothing in such agreements shall be construed as modifying any of the obligations of the lessee, including, but not limited to, obligations imposed by requirements of the MMS for reporting, accounting, and auditing; obligations for diligent development and operation, protection against drainage and mining in trespass, compliance with oil and gas, geothermal, and mining regulations (25 CFR part 216; 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, and 3590; and those applicable rules found in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C) and the requirements for Secretarial approval before abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. All such obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free of any such overriding royalties or payments. The existence of agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered as justification for the approval of abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. Nothing in this paragraph revokes the requirement for approval of assignments and other instruments which is required in this section, but any overriding royalties or payments out of production created by the provisions of such assignments or instruments shall be subject to the condition stated in this section. Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating operators shall be filed with the superintendent unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant to this section.

###### § 211.54 Lease or permit cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.

(a) If the Secretary determines that a permittee or lessee has failed to comply with the terms of the permit or lease; the regulations in this part; or other applicable laws or regulations; the Secretary may:

(1) Serve a notice of noncompliance specifying in what respect the permittee or lessee has failed to comply with the requirements referenced in this paragraph, and specifying what actions, if any, must be taken to correct the noncompliance; or

(2) Serve a notice of proposed cancellation of the lease or permit. The notice of proposed cancellation shall set forth the reasons why lease or permit cancellation is proposed and shall specify what actions, if any, must be taken to avoid cancellation.

(c) The notice shall be served upon the permittee or lessee by delivery in person or by certified mail to the permittee or lessee at the permittee's or lessee's last known address. When certified mail is used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when the notice is received or five (5) working days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.

(d) The lessee or permittee shall have thirty (30) days (or such longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is served to respond, in writing, to the official or the Bureau of Indian Affairs office that issued the notice.

(e) If a permittee or lessee fails to take any action that is prescribed in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a timely written response to the notice, or files a written response that does not, in the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the permittee's or lessee's actions, then the Secretary may cancel the lease or permit, specifying the basis for the cancellation.

(f) If a permittee or lessee fails to take corrective action or to file a timely written response adequately justifying the permittee's or lessee's actions pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary may issue an order of cessation of operations. If the permittee or lessee fails to comply with the order of cessation, or fails to timely file an appeal of the order of cessation pursuant to paragraph (h), the Secretary may issue an order of lease or permit cancellation.

(g) Cancellation of a lease or permit shall not relieve the lessee or permittee of any continuing obligations under the lease or permit.

(h) Orders of cessation or of lease or permit cancellation issued pursuant to this section may be appealed under 25 CFR part 2.

(i) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian mineral owner as set forth in the lease or permit.

(b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the lessee or permittee either personally or by certified mail to the lessee or permittee at the lessee's or permittee's last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date when received or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.

(c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the lessee or permittee of the lessee's or permittee's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be held before the superintendent and/or area director whose findings shall be conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.

(d) If the lessee or permittee served with a notice of proposed penalty requests a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a written suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a suspension will not be detrimental to the lessor and upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.

(e) Payment in full of penalties more than ten (10) days after a final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the lessee or permittee to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific lease provision prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments shall be a rate applicable under § 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is late.

(f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:

(1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the authorized officer, the director's representative or the MMS official to impose penalties for violations of applicable regulations pursuant to 43 CFR part 3160, and 43 CFR Groups 3400 and 3500, 30 CFR part 750, or 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C;

(2) Replacing or superseding any penalty provision in the terms and conditions of a lease or permit approved by the Secretary pursuant to this part; or

(3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of lease or permit terms for which the authorized officer, director's representative or MMS official, have either statutory or regulatory authority to assess a penalty.

##### Subpart B - How To Acquire Leases

###### § 212.20 Leasing procedures.

(a) Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over the lands.

(b) Indian mineral owners may request the Secretary to prepare, advertise and negotiate mineral leases on their behalf. Leases for minerals shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section unless one or more of the Indian mineral owners of a tract sought for lease request the Secretary to negotiate for a lease on their behalf without advertising. Unless the Secretary decides that negotiation of a mineral lease is in the best interests of the Indian mineral owners, he shall use the following procedure for leasing:

(1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements on lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate agency or area office for future reference.

(2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to a responsible bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary shall establish the rental and royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and will not be subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that acceptance of the lease bid by or on behalf of the Indian mineral owner is required. The requirements under § 212.21 are applicable to the acceptance of a lease bid.

(3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that bid is not accepted.

(4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.

(5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall also file the lease in completed form, signed by the Indian mineral owner(s), at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.

(6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder fails to complete all requirements necessary for approval of the lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-advertise the tract for sale, or subject to the consent of the Indian mineral owner, a lease may be let through private negotiations.

(c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained. The requirements under § 212.21 are applicable to the approval of a mineral lease.

###### § 212.21 Execution of leases.

(a) The Secretary shall not execute a mineral lease on behalf of an Indian mineral owner, except when such owner is deceased and the heirs to or devisee of the estate have not been determined, or if determined, some or all of them cannot be located. Leases involving such interests may be executed by the Secretary, provided that the mineral interest shall have been offered for sale under the provisions of section 212.20(b) (1) through (6).

(b) The Secretary may execute leases on behalf of minors and persons who are incompetent by reason of mental incapacity;that there is no parent, guardian, conservator, or other person who has lawful authority to execute a lease on behalf of the minor or person with mental incapacity.

(c) If an owner is a life tenant, the procedures set forth in 25 CFR part 179 (Life Estates and Future Interests), shall apply.

###### § 212.28 Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

(a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of agreements that allocate costs and benefits.

(b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is specifically required in the lease.

(c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be filed with the superintendent or area director.

(d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice requirement.

(e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.

(f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved before the lease expiration date.

(g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be effective on the date the agreement is effective.

(h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program approved by the authorized officer.

###### § 212.29 [Reserved]

###### § 212.30 Removal of restrictions.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any mineral lease to the contrary, the removal of all restrictions against alienation shall operate to divest the Secretary of all supervisory authority and responsibility with respect to the lease. Thereafter, all payments required to be made under the lease shall be made directly to the owner(s).

(b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land included in any lease approved by the Secretary, the entire lease shall continue to be subject to the supervision of the Secretary until such times as the holder of the lease and the unrestricted Indian owner submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that adequate arrangements have been made to account for the mineral resources of the restricted land separately from those of the unrestricted. Thereafter, the unrestricted portion shall be relieved from the supervision of the Secretary, the lease, the regulations of this part, and all other applicable laws and regulations.

###### §§ 212.31-212.32 [Reserved]

###### § 212.33 Terms applying after relinquishment.

All leases for individual Indian lands approved by the Secretary under this part shall contain provisions for the relinquishment of supervision and provide for operations of the lease after such relinquishment. These leases shall contain provisions that address the following issues:

(a)If the Secretary relinquishes supervision at any time during the life of the lease instrument as to all or part of the acreage subject to the lease, the Secretary shall give the Indian mineral owner and the lessee thirty (30) days written notice prior to the termination of supervision. After notice of relinquishment has been given to the lessee, the lease shall be subject to the following conditions:

(1) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid directly to the lessor or the lessor's successors in title, or to a trustee appointed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary, the lessee has made all payments then due and has fully performed all obligations on the lessee's part to be performed up to the time of such relinquishment, the bond given to secure the performance of the lease, on file in the appropriate agency or area office, shall be of no further force or effect.

(3) Should relinquishment affect only part of the lease, then the lessee may continue to conduct operations on the land covered by the lease as an entirety;that the lessee shall pay, in the manner prescribed by the lease and regulations for the benefit of lessor, the same proportion of all rentals and royalties due under the provisions of this part as the acreage retained under the supervision of the Secretary bears to the entire acreage of the lessee, and shall pay the remainder of the rentals and royalties directly to the remaining lessors or successors in title or said trustee as the case may be, as provided in paragraph (a) (1) of this section.

(b)If, after the execution of the lease and after the Secretary relinquishes supervision thereof, the fee of the leased land is divided into separate parcels held by different owners, or if the rental or royalty interest is divided in ownership, the obligations of the lessee shall not be modified in any manner except as specifically provided by the provisions of the lease. Notwithstanding such separate ownership, the lessee may continue to conduct operations on said premises as an entirety. Each separate owner shall receive such proportion of all rental and royalties accruing after the vesting of its title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty interest, bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the entire rental or royalty interest as the case may be. If at any time after departmental supervision of the lease is relinquished, in whole or in part, to rentals and royalties, whether said parties are so entitled by virtue of undivided interest or by virtue of ownership of separate parcels of the land covered, the lessee may elect to withhold the payment of further rentals or royalties (except as the portion due the Indian lessor while under restriction), until all of said parties shall agree upon and designate a trustee in writing and in a recordable instrument to receive all payments due thereunder on behalf of said parties and their respective successors in title. Payments to said trustee shall constitute lawful payments, and the sole risk of an improper or unlawful distribution of said funds by said trustee shall rest upon the parties naming said trustee and their said respective successors in title.

###### § 212.34 Individual tribal assignments excluded.

The reference in this part to Indian mineral owners does not include assignments of tribal lands made pursuant to tribal constitutions or ordinances for the use of individual Indians and assignees of such lands.

(a) A lessee shall pay, in advance, beginning with the effective date of the lease, an annual rental of $2.00 per acre or fraction of an acre or such other greater amount as prescribed in the lease. This rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.

(b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less than 16&#x2013;percent of the amount or value of production produced and sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area director if the approving official is the superintendent and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the area director.

(c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.

##### § 215.9 Execution of leases.

Before any lease is entered into by the Indian owners or is approved by the Secretary of the Interior, all the adult and competent owners or co-owners of the tract of land which it is proposed to lease, shall be furnished by the Bureau such geological reports as may be available or that can be secured from the representative of the Geological Survey showing the estimated mineral reserves on said property, the estimated reasonable value of such property for mining purposes, and such other data as might reasonably be necessary to fully advise the owners of said property of the then present status and mining value of their lands. If the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor, or is otherwise an incompetent as defined in the regulations in this part, the lease contract shall be executed by the superintendent for and on behalf of such minor or such incompetent. The leases executed, either by the Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent in his behalf, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall be effective only upon such approval.

##### § 215.10 Renewal of leases on developed lands.

(a) In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased, and lead and zinc ores have been discovered hereon, and it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior to be advisable and to the best interests of the Indian owners of the lands that the terms of the existing lease or leases be extended or that a new lease or leases for an additional period of time, or that a new lease or leases to take effect upon the expiration of present valid leases, should, upon application therefor, be granted to either the present lessees or to parties holding under assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, from such present lessees, or to parties who have expended capital in lead and zinc mining operation and development of the land under such leases, assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, a new lease or leases or contract of extension or existing lease or leases as may be authorized by the Secretary of the Interior may be entered into with the proper party or parties as may be determined by said Secretary of the Interior, and such new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases shall be executed subject to the regulations in this part by and between the Indian owner of the land, if an adult and not incompetent as defined in § 215.0 (c), and said proper party or parties. If the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor or an otherwise incompetent as defined in § 215.0 (c), the superintendent shall execute the new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases for and on behalf of said Indian minor or incompetent. Said new leases or contracts of extension of old leases, whether executed by the Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent for and in his behalf, shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall become effective only upon such approval. No offering for sale at public auction or advertisement of sale will be necessary in reference to contracts of extension of leases, or to leases entered into under this section, as above provided, but such lease or contract shall be upon such terms as to bonus and royalty as may be determined and fixed in each case by the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of § 215.5. The approval by the Secretary of the Interior of new leases or of the contracts of extension of old leases shall be conclusive as to the validity of said leases, or contracts of extension of leases, the manner and method of negotiating the same, and the execution thereof. If, however, in any case where lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been discovered thereon, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior that the extension of the existing lease or leases or the granting of new leases to the present lessees, or to the persons or parties holding under said lessees by assignment, sublease, or mining contract, would not be to the best interests of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior may, at the expiration, cancellation, or forfeiture of the existing lease, cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure shall be followed as provided in §§ 215.7 through 215.9.

(b) Applications under the provision of this section for a lease or extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of lease will not be received or considered prior to the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land covered by such application.

(c) Applications under the provisions of this section for a lease or extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of lease shall be filed with the superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at any time within the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land covered by such application, and if the records of or papers in the office of said superintendent or the records of the county court of Ottawa County, Okla., indicate that there are any prior existing leases, subleases, assignments of leases or mining contracts covering any of the land applied for, the superintendent shall notify all persons having or claiming any rights or interest in or under said prior existing leases, subleases, assignments of leases, or mining contract concerning said application for lease or extension of lease, and that they will be allowed 10 days in which to file with the superintendent any objection they may have to the allowance of the application or to the approval of the new lease or extension of existing lease. If objection or protest is made by any owner of the land or by any person claiming rights or interests in or under existing lease, sublease, assignment of lease, or mining contract, a reasonable time, not exceeding 20 days, shall be allowed them in which to file their statement or brief in support of their protest or objection, and a reasonable further time not exceeding 10 days shall be allowed the applicant for new lease or for extension of existing lease to reply in support of the application. In case of contest, hearings may be had if deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior or his representative. The application and papers in each case shall be forwarded by the superintendent of the Quapaw Indian Agency to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation in regard thereto.

##### § 215.11 New leases where prior leases have been forfeited or abandoned.

In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been discovered but the mines and mining operations have been abandoned and the leases have been canceled or forfeited or have expired, special arrangements in the matter of the leasing and mining of said lands may be made provided the consent thereto of the Secretary of the Interior be first obtained. Applications containing special offers as to the terms and conditions may be considered by the Secretary of the Interior and the leasing of said lands may be made upon such special terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may in each case deem to be for the best interests of the Indian owners of the land. If, however, in any case, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior that the granting of such lease would not be to the best interest of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior may cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder.

#### PART 225 - OIL AND GAS, GEOTHERMAL, AND SOLID MINERALS AGREEMENTS

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 225.1 Purpose and scope.

(a) The regulations in this part, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, govern minerals agreements for the development of Indian-owned minerals entered into pursuant to the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 U.S.C. 2101&#x2013;2108 (IMDA). These regulations are applicable to the lands or interests in lands of any Indian tribe, individual Indian or Alaska native the title to which is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. These regulations are intended to ensure that Indian mineral owners are permitted to enter into minerals agreements that will allow the Indian mineral owners to have more responsibility in overseeing and greater flexibility in disposing of their mineral resources, and to allow development in the manner which the Indian mineral owners believe will maximize their best economic interest and minimize any adverse environmental or cultural impact resulting from such development. Pursuant to section 4 of the IMDA (25 U.S.C. 2103(e)), as part of this greater flexibility, where the Secretary has approved a minerals agreement in compliance with the provisions of 25 U.S.C. chap. 23 and any other applicable provision of law, the United States shall not be liable for losses sustained by a tribe or individual Indian under such minerals agreement. However, as further stated in the IMDA, the Secretary continues to have a trust obligation to ensure that the rights of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a violation of the terms of any minerals agreement, and to uphold the duties of the United States as derived from the trust relationship and from any treaties, executive orders, or agreements between the United States and any Indian tribe.

(b) The regulations in this part shall become effective and in full force on April 29, 1994, and shall be subject to amendment at any time by the Secretary;that no such regulation that becomes effective after the date of approval of any minerals agreement shall operate to affect the duration of the minerals agreement, the rate of royalty or financial consideration, rental, or acreage unless agreed to by all parties to the minerals agreement.

(c) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management Service that are referenced in §§ 225.4, 225.5, and 225.6 are supplemental to these regulations, and apply to minerals agreements for development of Indian mineral resources unless specifically stated otherwise in this part or in other Federal regulations. To the extent the parties to a minerals agreement are able to provide reasonable provisions satisfactorily addressing the issues of valuation, method of payment, accounting, and auditing, governed by the Minerals Management Service regulations, the Secretary may approve alternate provisions in a minerals agreement.

(d) Nothing in these regulations is intended to prevent Indian tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to regulate the conduct of persons, businesses, or minerals operations within their territorial jurisdiction.

###### § 225.2 Information collection.

(b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the operator either personally or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date received or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.

(c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the operator of the operator's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty.

The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.

(e) Payment of penalties in full more than ten (10) days after a final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the operator to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific minerals agreement provision prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments shall be a rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is late.

(f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:

(1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official to impose penalties under applicable statutory or regulatory authorities;

(2) Replacing, superseding, or replicating any penalty provision in the terms and conditions of a minerals agreement approved by the Secretary pursuant to this part; or

(a) The purposes of these regulations (part 249) are:

(1) To assist in protecting the off-reservation nonexclusive fishing rights which are secured to certain Indian tribes by their treaties with the United States;

(2) To promote the proper management, conservation and protection of fisheries resources which are subject to such treaties of the United States;

(3) To provide for determination of restrictions on the manner of exercising nonexclusive fishing privileges under rights secured to Indian tribes by such treaties of the United States necessary for conservation of the fisheries resources;

(4) To assist in the orderly administration of Indian Affairs;

(5) To encourage consultation and cooperation between the states and Indian tribes in the management and improvement of fisheries resources affected by such treaties;

(6) To assist the states in enforcing their laws and regulations for the management and conservation of fisheries resources in a manner compatible with the treaties of the United States which are applicable to such resources.

(b) The conservation regulations of this part 249 are found to be necessary to assure that the nonexclusive rights secured to certain Indian tribes by treaties of the United States to fish at usual and accustomed places outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation shall be protected and preserved for the benefit of present and future members of such tribes in a manner consistent with the nonexclusive character of such rights. Any exercise of an Indian off-reservation treaty fishing right shall be in accordance with this part and any applicable area regulations issued hereunder.

###### § 249.2 Area regulations.

(a) The Secretary of the Interior may upon request of an Indian tribe, request of a State Governor, or upon his own motion, and upon finding that Federal regulation of Indian fishing in any waters in which Indians have a treaty-secured nonexclusive fishing right is necessary to assure the conservation and wise utilization of the fishery resources for the present and future use and enjoyment of the Indians and other persons entitled thereto, promulgate regulations to govern the exercise of such treaty-secured fishing right in such waters for the purpose of preventing, in conjunction with appropriate State conservation laws and regulations governing fishing by persons not fishing under treaty rights, the deterioration of the fishery resources.

(b) In formulating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior may incorporate such State laws or regulations, or such tribal regulations as have been approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, as he finds to be consistent with the Indians' rights under the Treaty and the conservation of the fishery resources.

(c) Before promulgating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior will seek the views of the affected Indian tribes, of the fish or game management agency or agencies of any affected State, and of other interested persons. Except in emergencies where the Secretary finds that the exigencies require the promulgation of regulations to be effective immediately, a notice of proposed rule making will be published in thein accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 to afford an opportunity to submit comments and information, at such times and in such manner as may be specified in the notice. In the event of the emergency promulgation of regulations, interested persons will be afforded, as soon as possible, an opportunity to request amendment or revocation thereof.

(d) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section shall contain provisions for invoking emergency closures or restrictions or the relaxation thereof at the field level when necessary or appropriate to meet conditions not foreseeable at the time the regulations were issued.

(e) Regulations issued pursuant to this § 249.2 may include such requirements for recording and reporting catch statistics as the appropriate state fish and game agencies or the Secretary of the Interior deem necessary for effective fishery management.

###### § 249.3 Identification cards.

(a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall arrange for the issuance of an appropriate identification card to any Indian entitled thereto as prima facie evidence that the authorized holder thereof is entitled to exercise the fishing rights secured by the treaty designated thereon. The Commissioner may cause a federal card to be issued for this purpose or may authorize the issuance of cards by proper tribal authorities:That any such tribal cards shall be countersigned by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs certifying that the person named on the card is a member of the tribe issuing such card and that said tribe is recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as having fishing rights under the treaty specified on such card. Copies of the form of any identification card authorized pursuant to this section and a list of the authorized Bureau of Indian Affairs issuing or countersigning officials shall be furnished to the fisheries management and enforcement agencies of any State in which such fishing rights may be exercised.

(b) No such card shall be issued to any Indian who is not on the official membership roll of the tribe which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior.That until further notice, a temporary card may be issued to any member of a tribe not having an approved current membership roll who submits evidence of his/her entitlement thereto satisfactory to the issuing officer and, in the case of a tribally issued card, to the countersigning officer. Any Indian claiming to have been wrongfully denied a card may appeal the decision in accordance with part 2 of this chapter.

(c) No person shall be issued an identification card on the basis of membership in more than one tribe at any one time.

(d) Each card shall state the name, address, tribal affiliation and enrollment number (if any) of the holder, identify the treaty under which the holder is entitled to fishing rights, contain such additional personal identification data as is required on fishing licenses issued under the law of the State or States within which it is used, and be signed by the issuing officer and by the holder.

(e) No charge or fee of any kind shall be imposed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the issuance of an identification card hereunder:That this shall not prevent any Indian tribe from imposing any fee or tax which it may otherwise be authorized to impose upon the exercise of any tribal fishing right.

(f) All cards issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to this part 249 shall be and remain the property of the United States and may be retaken by any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer from any unauthorized holder. Any card so retaken shall be immediately forwarded to the officer who issued it.

(g) The failure of any person who claims to be entitled to the benefits of a treaty fishing right to have such a card in his immediate personal possession while fishing or engaging in other activity in the claimed exercise of such right to display it upon request to any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer shall be prima facie evidence that the person is not entitled to exercise an Indian fishing right under a treaty of the United States.

(h) No person shall allow any use of his identification card by any other person.

###### § 256.19 How are work plans prepared?

(a) First, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing housing office will visit your house to identify what renovation and or replacement will be done under the HIP. The representative will ensure that flood, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and earthquake requirements are met, including the determination that the renovation or replacement is appropriately treated as a categorical exclusion.

(b) Second, based on the list of renovations or replacement to be done, your servicing housing office will estimate the total cost of renovation to your house. Cost estimates will be based on locally available services and product costs, or other regional-based, industry-recognized cost data, such as that provided by the MEANs or Marshall Swift. If the house is located in Alaska, documented, reasonable, substantiated freight costs, in accordance with Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR 101&#x2013;40), not to exceed 100 percent of the cost of materials, can be added to the cost of the project.

If the estimated cost to renovate your house is more than $60,000, your servicing housing office will recommend your house for replacement or refer you to another source for housing. The other source does not have to be for a replacement house; it may be for government-subsidized rental units or other sources for standard housing.

(d) Fourth, your servicing housing office will develop a detailed, written report, called a scope of work, that identifies what renovation or construction work on your house will be accomplished and how. The scope of work is used to inform potential bidders of what work is to be done.

(1) Meet the occupancy and square footage criteria in § 256.10 (d); and

(2) Provide complete and detailed instructions to the builder.

###### § 256.20 How will I find out what work is to be done?

The servicing housing office will notify you in writing what work is being scheduled under the HIP. You will be requested to approve the scheduled work by signing a copy of the notice and returning it to the servicing housing office. Work will start after you return the signed copy to the servicing housing office.

###### § 256.21 Who does the work?

Your house will be renovated or replaced by either:

(a) A licensed and bonded independent contractor or construction company; or

(b) A tribe that operates the HIP under an Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act agreement.

###### § 256.22 How are construction contractors or companies selected and paid?

The servicing housing office must follow Federal procurement or other Bureau-approved tribal procurement policy. Generally, your servicing housing office develops a “bid specification” or statement of work, which identifies the work to be performed. The appropriate contracting office uses the “bid specification” to provide information and invite bids on the project to interested parties. The contracting office selects the winning bidder after technical review of the bids by and written recommendation from the servicing housing office, and after determination that the bidder is qualified and capable of completing the project as advertised.

(a) Partial payments to independent contractors will not exceed 80 percent of the value of the completed and acceptable work.

(b) Recommendation for final payment will be made after final inspection and after all provisions of the contract have been met and all work has been completed.

###### § 256.23 Do I have to move out while work is done?

(a) You will be notified by your servicing housing office that you must vacate your house only if:

(1) It is scheduled for major renovations requiring that all occupants vacate the house for safety reasons; or

(2) It is scheduled for replacement, which requires demolition of your current house.

(b) If you are required to vacate the premises during construction, you are responsible for:

(1) Locating other lodging;

(2) Paying all costs associated with vacating and living away from the house; and

(3) Removing all your belongings and furnishings before the scheduled beginning work date.

###### § 256.24 How can I be sure that construction work meets minimum standards?

(a) At various stages of construction, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing housing office or a building inspector will review the work to ensure that it meets construction standards and building codes. Upon completion of each stage, further construction can begin only after the inspection occurs and approval is granted.

(b) Inspections of construction and renovation will occur, at a minimum, at the following stages:

(1) Upon completion of inspection footings and foundations;

(2) Upon completion of inspection rough-in, roughwiring, and plumbing; and

(3) At final completion.

###### § 256.25 How will I find out that the work is done?

Your servicing housing office will advise you, in writing, that the work has been completed in compliance with the project contract. Also, you will have a final walk-through of the house with a representative of your servicing housing office. You will be requested to verify that you received the notice of completion of the work by signing a copy of the notice and returning it to your servicing housing office.

###### § 256.26 Will I need flood insurance?

You will need flood insurance if your house is located in an area identified as having special flood hazards under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93&#x2013;234, 87 Stat. 975). Your servicing housing office will advise you.

###### § 256.27 Is my Federal government-assisted house eligible for services?

No. The intention of this program is to assist the neediest of the needy, who have never received services from any other Federal entity.

###### § 256.28 I have a mobile home; am I eligible for help?

Yes. If you meet the eligibility criteria in § 256.6 and funding is available, you can receive any of the HIP services identified in § 256.7. If you request Category B services and your mobile home has exterior walls less than three inches thick, you must be considered for Category C services.

###### § 256.29 Can HIP resources be combined with other available resources?

Yes. HIP resources may be supplemented with other available resources (, in-kind assistance; tribal or housing authority; and any other leveraging mechanism identified in § 256.3(d)) to increase the number of HIP recipients.

###### § 256.30 Can I appeal actions taken under this part?

You may appeal action or inaction by a BIA official, in accordance with 25 CFR part 2.

(3) Consultants, advisors, and others serving by contractual agreement as agents for Indian tribes may use the provisions in § 262.5(f) of this part to expedite the process of obtaining a permit.

(4) Persons serving as agents for Indian tribes as employees or by contractual agreement may abbreviate the consultation required in § 262.3(b) of this part by disregarding the requirement to consult first with the tribe and, provided the communication is documented, by consulting with the Area Director orally. In these cases, the Area Director need only respond when a permit is deemed necessary and may do so either orally or in writing. If a response is not received within 3 working days after an oral description of the proposed work is made or within 7 working days after a written description is mailed to the Area Director, the work may proceed.

##### § 262.5 Application for permits.

(a) Permits from the BIA shall be issued when an applicant meets the requirements set out in 43 CFR 7.8, and may be conditioned, modified, suspended, or revoked by the Area Director. Area Directors may delegate this authority to Agency Superintendents, but only on a permit-by-permit basis and only to those who have adequate professional support available.

(b) Prospective applicants may obtain details on how to apply for a permit by contacting the Area Director, at BIA Area Offices in: Aberdeen, SD; Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; Arlington, VA; Billings, MT; Gallup, NM; Juneau, AK; Minneapolis, MN; Muskogee, OK; Phoenix, AZ; Portland, OR; or Sacramento, CA; or by writing to the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.

(c) Permit applications proposing the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands shall include the following consent documents:

(1) Written permission from the Indian landowner and from the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over those lands. This must contain such terms and conditions as the landowner or tribe may request be included in the permit. Where the permission is from a tribe, it should either state that no religious or cultural site will be harmed or destroyed by the proposed work or specify terms and conditions that the permit must include in order to safeguard against such harm or destruction.

(i) For lands of Indian tribes, permission must be granted by the tribe.

(ii) For lands of Indian individuals not under tribal jurisdiction, permission must be granted by the owner(s), except as provided in § 262.6.

(iii) For lands of Indian individuals under tribal jurisdiction, permission must be granted by both the owner(s), except as provided in § 262.6, and the tribe having such jurisdiction. Where an applicant is the owner, consent must still be obtained from the tribe.

(iv) Where the ownership of lands of Indian individuals is multiple, permission must be granted by the owners of a majority of interests, except as provided in § 262.6. The same shall apply where the applicant is one of the owners.

(v) Where the terms and conditions a tribe or landowner requests be included in a permit are in conflict with the provisions of this or any other Act, with Federal regulations, or with each other, the Area Director may negotiate with the requestor to eliminate the conflict. If the conflict remains, the permit may not be issued.

(2) Copies of any permits required by tribal law for archaeological work on lands under tribal jurisdiction. This may serve as written consent from the tribe for the purposes of § 262.5(c)(1).

(3) Written agreement by the Indian landowner(s) to release archaeological resources for curation or study, as specified in § 262.8(b).

(d) Permits issued by the BIA shall include the following or similar condition: “Human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony may not be excavated or removed unless the permittee has obtained the written consent of the Area Director. In order to obtain consent, the permittee shall present to the Area Director written evidence of prior consultation with the appropriate Indian tribe. If the lands containing the remains or objects are tribal lands, the permittee shall first obtain the written consent of the tribe having jurisdiction over the lands.” Determination as to which tribe is the appropriate tribe shall be made in accordance with § 262.8(a). Area Director consent shall be based on the scientific appropriateness of the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis and may, if documented, be oral. This condition may be omitted from the permit when such excavation or removal is proposed, and the requirements of the condition are met, in the permit application.

(e) Information and assistance in contacting Indian tribes and individual Indian landowners for the purpose of requesting the consent documents listed under paragraph (c) of this section or of seeking the consultation and consent required under paragraph (d) of this section may be obtained from the BIA office to which the permit application is submitted.

(f) Contractual agreements with the BIA or Indian tribes and permits issued by Indian tribes may be accepted as support documents for permit applications. They may also double as permit documents, if they demonstrate that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at 43 CFR part 7 have been met and they are attached to a Department of the Interior permit form. This form must be signed by the Area Director, but need only contain the following or similar statement: “This permit is issued to the person(s) named, and in accordance with the terms and conditions in the attached (contractual agreement/tribal permit).”

(g) Area Directors shall respond to permit applications within 15 working days of receipt.

##### § 262.6 Landowner consent by the Secretary.

The Secretary of the Interior, or delegate thereof, may, on behalf of the owner(s) of lands of Indian individuals, grant consent for the purposes in § 262.5(c)(1) and (3) when the Secretary or his or her delegate finds that such consent will not result in any injury to the land or owner(s) and when one or more of the following conditions exist:

(a) The owner is a minor or a person

(b) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner have not been determined;

(c) The whereabouts of the owner are unknown;

(d) Multiple owners are so numerous that the Secretary or his or her delegate finds, after documenting his or her efforts to do so, that it would be impractical to obtain their consent, as prescribed in § 262.5(c)(1)(iv) and provided the Secretary or his or her delegate also notifies, in writing, the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over the land and allows 15 working days from the date of mailing date for response; or

(e) The owner has given the Secretary or his or her delegate written authority to grant such consent on his or her behalf.

##### § 262.7 Notice to Indian tribes of possible harm to cultural or religious sites.

When consent by an Indian tribe to proposed excavation or removal of archaeological resources from Indian lands it owns or over which it has jurisdiction contains all of the information written as prescribed and advised in § 262.5(c)(1), it may be taken to mean that subject to such terms and conditions as the tribe might specify, issuance of a permit for the proposed work will not result in harm to, or destruction of, any site of religious or cultural importance. No further notification is necessary, unless the Area Director has reason to believe that the proposed work might harm or destroy a site of religious or cultural importance to another tribe or Native American group. He or she shall then follow the notification procedures at 43 CFR 7.7. Those procedures must also be followed when proposed work might affect lands of Indian individuals over which there is no tribal jurisdiction or public lands owned or administered by the BIA.

##### § 262.8 Custody of archaeological resources.

(a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands, except for human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony, remain the property of the Indian tribe or individual(s) having rights of ownership over such lands. Ownership and right of control over the disposition of the excepted items shall be in accordance with the order of priority provided in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Pub. L. 101&#x2013;601), adapted for the purpose of this rule as follows:

(1) In the case of human remains of Indians and funerary objects, in the lineal descendants of the Indian; or

(2) In any case in which such lineal descendants cannot be ascertained, and in the case of sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony:

(i) In the Indian tribe on whose tribal lands, or on the individual Indian lands of whose members, such remains or objects are discovered;

(ii) In the Indian tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the public lands owned or administered by the BIA on which such remains or objects are discovered, if upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those remains or objects; or

(iii) Where it can be so demonstrated by a preponderance of evidence, in the tribe other than that in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section having the strongest cultural relationship with such remains or objects, if, upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those remains or objects.

(iv) The Area Director shall provide the required notice to any Indian tribe identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, in writing, within 5 working days after such identification has been documented and confirmed, and shall at the same time submit a copy of the notice for publication in theThis notice shall include a description of the remains or objects; of where, how, and why they were excavated or removed; and of the evidence used to identify the tribe being notified. The remains or objects in question shall be considered the property of the pertinent tribe under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section or, in the case of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, held and administered by the BIA until or unless a claim is stated.

(b) No permit for the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands may be issued without the written consent of the Indian landowner(s) either to grant custody of the resources recovered (other than human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony) to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79 or to allow the permittee a reasonable period of time to hold or have ready access to them at an appropriate location for study. The excepted remains and objects are covered under § 262.5(d) of this part which, in general, permits their excavation or removal only when the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis are scientifically appropriate. Written consent to custody by a curatorial facility may include terms and conditions regarding curation (e.g., cleaning, viewing, loaning, studying, etc.), provided these are consistent with 36 CFR part 79.

(1) On lands of Indian tribes, consent must be obtained from the tribe.

(2) On lands of Indian individuals, consent must be obtained from the owner of the land or the owners of a majority of interests therein, except as provided in § 262.6.

(3) Where consent is by the owners of a majority of interests, it must, if the archaeological resources are to be retained by or returned after study to the interest holders, designate a representative to receive those resources. Whether and how these are subsequently distributed among themselves is a matter for the interest holders to decide.

(c) The Area Director may, after notifying the tribe (if any) having jurisdiction over such lands and allowing 15 working days for response, decline to issue a permit for lands of Indian individuals if he or she has any verifiable reason to believe that archaeological resources retained by the landowner(s) after being studied will be sold or exchanged other than to the tribe having jurisdiction or to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. The basis for decline shall be that excavation or removal of resources under such circumstances would not be in the public interest and would thus be contrary to the purposes of the Act.

(d) The landowner(s) alone may grant custody of archaeological resources (except for human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony, which are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section) excavated or removed from lands of Indian individuals that are under tribal jurisdiction to a curatorial facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. When, however, such consignment constitutes the ultimate disposition of these resources, the tribe having jurisdiction must also grant its consent. Any subsequent exchange or disposition by the facility must have the consent of both the landowner(s) and the tribe.

#### PART 265 - ESTABLISHMENT OF ROADLESS AND WILD AREAS ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS

##### § 265.1 Definition of roadless area.

A roadless area has been defined as one which contains no provision for the passage of motorized transportation and which is at least 100,000 acres in extent. Under this definition the Secretary of the Interior ordered (3 FR 609, Mar. 22, 1938) certain roadless areas established on Indian reservations. The following is the only presently existing roadless area:

(a) The boundaries of the Wind River Reserve roadless area are as follows:

##### § 265.3 Roads prohibited.

(a) Within the boundaries of this officially designated roadless area it will be the policy of the Interior Department to refuse consent to the construction or establishment of any routes passable to motor transportation, including in this restriction highways, roads, truck trails, work roads, and all other types of ways constructed to make possible the passage of motor vehicles either for transportation of people or for the hauling of supplies and equipment, unless the requirements of fire protection, commercial use for the Indians' benefit or actual needs of the Indians clearly demand otherwise.

(b) Foot trails and horse trails are not barred. The Superintendent of the Wind River Reservation on which this roadless area has been established will be held strictly accountable for seeing that the area is maintained in a roadless condition. Elimination of this area or any part thereof from the restriction of this order will be made only upon a written showing of an actual and controlling need.

The purpose of this part is to set forth the process by which the Secretary will enter into contracts for the education of Indian students under the Johnson-O'Malley Act. Such contracts are for the purpose of financially assisting those efforts designed to meet the specialized and unique educational needs of eligible Indian students, including supplemental programs and school operational support, where such support is necessary to maintain established State educational standards.

###### § 273.102 How will revision or amendments be made to this part?

Prior to making any substantive revisions or amendments to this part, the Secretary will consult with Indian Tribes and national and regional Indian organizations to the extent practicable about the need for revision or amendment and will consider their views in preparing the proposed revision or amendment.

###### § 273.103 What is the Secretary's policy of maximum Indian participation?

The meaningful participation in all aspects of educational program development and implementation by those affected by such programs is an essential requisite for success.

The Secretary will, to the extent practicable, and subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure full geographic coverage and the full participation of all federally recognized Tribes and school districts, regardless of whether the school districts or Tribal organizations had entered into a contract under the Johnson-O'Malley Act before fiscal year 1995. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary will consult with Indian Tribes and contact State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and Alaska Native organizations that have not previously entered into a contract in the implementation of this section.

###### § 273.105 How do these regulations affect existing Tribal rights?

Nothing in these regulations may be construed as:

(3) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the grantee shall return all real property furnished or purchased wholly with Bureau grant funds to the control of the Bureau. In the case of property purchased in part with Bureau grant funds, the grantee may be permitted to take title to the Federal interest therein upon compensating the Federal Government for its fair share of the property.

(A) Other grants from the Bureau needing the property.

(B) Grants of other Federal agencies needing the property.

(ii) When the grantee no longer has need for the property in any of its Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the grantor, the property may be used for its own official activities in accordance with the following standards:

(A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of less than $500 and used four years or more. The grantee may use the property for its own official activities without reimbursement to the Federal government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.

(B) All other nonexpendable property. The grantee may retain the property for its own use if a fair compensation is made to the Bureau for the latter's share of the property. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of the property.

(iii) If the grantee has no need for the property, disposition of the property shall be made as follows:

(A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or less. Except for that property which meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau an amount which is computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.

(B) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of over $1,000. The grantee shall request disposition instructions from the Bureau.

() If the grantee is instructed to otherwise dispose of the property, he shall be reimbursed by the Bureau of such costs incurred in its disposition.

() If disposition instructions are not issued within 120 days after reporting, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau and amount which is computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. Further, the grantee shall be permitted to retain $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.

(iv) Where the Bureau determines that property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more and financed solely with Bureau funds is unique, different, or costly to replace, it may reserve title to such property, subject to the following provisions:

(A) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant agreement or otherwise made known to the grantee.

(B) The Bureau shall issue disposition instructions within 120 days after the completion of the need for the property under the grant for which it was acquired. If the Bureau fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 days, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(B), and (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.

(2) Federally owned nonexpendable personal property. Unless statutory authority to transfer title has been granted to an agency, title to Federally owned property (property to which the Federal Government retains title including excess property made available by the Bureau to grantees) remains vested by law in the Federal Government. Upon termination of the grant or need for the property, such property shall be reported to the Bureau for further Bureau use or, if appropriate, for reporting to the General Services Administration for other Federal agency use. Appropriate disposition instructions will be issued to the grantee after completion of Bureau review.

(e) The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall also include the following procedural requirements:

(1) Property records shall be maintained accurately and provide for a description of the property; manufacturer's serial number or other identification number; acquisition date and cost; source of the property; percentage of Federal funds used in the purchase of property; location, use, and condition of the property; and ultimate disposition data including sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value if the grantee reimburses the bureau for its share.

(2) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to verify the existence, current use, and continued need for the property.

(3) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented.

(4) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.

(5) Proper sales procedures shall be established for unneeded property which would provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(f) When the total inventory value of any unused expendable personal property exceeds $500 at the expiration of need for any grant purposes, the grantee may retain the property or sell the property as long as he compensates the Bureau for its share in the cost. The amount of compensation shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

(g) Specific standards for control of intangible property are provided as follows:

(1) If any program produces patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions, in the course of work aided by a Bureau grant, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Bureau. Unless there is prior agreement between the grantee and Bureau on disposition of such items, the Bureau shall determine whether protection on such invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the invention or discovery&#x2014;including rights under any patent issued on it&#x2014;shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest consistent with “Government Patent Policy” (President's memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies), dated August 23, 1971, and Statement of Government Patent Policy as printed in 36 FR 16889.

(2) Where the grant results in a book or other copyrightable material, the author or grantee is eligible to copyright the work if it is found that (i) the retention of the copyright is not precluded by statute and (ii) equity or the public interest is best served by doing so, by reason of special circumstances. If it is found that the public interest is best served by limiting the term of any copyright to be obtained, such limits shall be set forth in the grant agreement. “Developmental” copyrights may be requested during the development, testing, or evaluation of copyrightable materials in order to prevent them from prematurely falling into the public domain. The copyright will be in accordance with copyright laws. However, the Government shall receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use the work for Government purposes. A copy of any copyright obtained by a grantee shall be provided to the Bureau. Program income received as royalties from copyrights on materials produced under grants is retained by the grantee during the grant period and is to be used according to the provisions of § 276.6(c). Specific agreements between the Bureau and the grantee shall be entered into before the grant is awarded to determine the uses of the royalty income after the grant is completed or terminated.

(h) The use of Bureau-owned facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner by a grantee for purposes of carrying out a grant may be authorized when the facilities are not needed for Bureau purposes.

##### § 276.12 Procurement standards.

(a) The standards contained in this section do not relieve the grantee of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contracts. The grantee is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Bureau regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into, in support of a grant. This includes but is not limited to: disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to the tribal, Federal or other authority which has proper jurisdiction.

(b) Grantees may use their own procurement regulations provided that procurements made with Bureau grant funds adhere to the standards set forth as follows:

(1) The grantee shall maintain a code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents in contracting with and expending Bureau grant funds. Grantee's officers, employees or agents, shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or potential contractors. To the extent permissible by law, rules or regulations, such standards shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by either the grantee officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents.

(2) All procurement transactions regardless of whether negotiated or advertised and without regard to dollar value shall be conducted in a manner so as to provide maximum open and free competition. The grantee should be alert to organizational conflicts of interest or non-competitive practices among contractors which may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

(3) The grantee shall establish procurement procedures which provide for, as a minimum, the following procedural requirements:

(i) Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by grantee official to avoid purchasing unnecessary or duplicative items. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical, practical procurement.

(ii) Invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall be based upon a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition. “Brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. When so used, the specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors should be clearly specified.

(iii) Positive efforts shall be made by the grantees to use small business and minority-owned business sources of supplies and services. Such efforts should allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete for contracts to be performed using Bureau grant funds. However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

(iv) The type of procuring instruments used (i.e., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, etc.) shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the grant program involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” method of contracting shall not be used.

(v) Formal advertising, with adequate purchase description, sealed bids, and public openings shall be the required method of procurement unless negotiation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section is necessary to accomplish sound procurement. However, procurement of $10,000 or less need not be so advertised. Where such advertised bids are obtained the awards shall be made to the responsible bidder whose bid is responsive to the invitation and is most advantageous to the grantee, price and other factors considered. (Factors such as discounts, transportation costs, taxes may be considered in determining the lowest bid.) Invitations for bids shall clearly set forth all requirements which the bidder must fulfill in order for his bid to be evaluated by the grantee. Any or all bids may be rejected when it is in the grantee's interest to do so.

(vi) Procurements may be negotiated if it is impractical and unfeasible to use formal advertising. Generally, procurements may be negotiated by the grantee if:

(A) The public exigency will not permit the delay incident to advertising;

(B) The material or service to be procured is available from only one person or firm; (all contemplated sole source procurements where the aggregate expenditure is expected to exceed $5,000 shall be referred to the Bureau for prior approval).

(C) The total amount involved does not exceed $10,000;

(D) The contract is for personal or professional services, or for any service to be rendered by a university, college, or other educational institutions;

(E) No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;

(F) The purchases are for highly perishable materials or medical supplies; for material or services where the prices are established by law; for technical items or equipment requiring standardization and interchangeability of parts with existing equipment; for experimental, developmental or research work; for supplies purchased for authorized resale; and for technical or specialized supplies requiring substantial initial investment for manufacture;

(G) Otherwise authorized by law, rules or regulations. Notwithstanding the existence of circumstances justifying negotiation, competition shall be obtained to the maximum extent practicable.

(vii) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, or accessibility to other necessary resources.

(viii) Procurement records or files for purchases in amounts over $10,000 shall provide at least the following pertinent information: Justification for the use of negotiation in lieu of advertising, contractor selection, and the basis for the cost or price negotiation.

(ix) A system for contract administration shall be maintained to assure contractor conformance with terms, conditions, and specifications of the contract or order, and to assure adequate and timely followup of all purchases.

(c) In addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the grantee shall include the following provisions in all contracts and subgrants:

(1) Contracts shall contain such contractual provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate.

(2) All contracts, amounts for which are over $10,000 shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the grantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions where the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

(3) In all contracts for construction or facility improvement awarded over $100,000, grantees shall observe the bonding requirements provided in § 276.4.

(4) All construction contracts awarded by recipients and their contractors or subgrantees having a value of more than $10,000, shall contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Labor Regulations (41 CFR part 87). However, this Equal Employment Opportunity provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in § 276.13 have been met.

(5) All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kick Back” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). This Act provides that each contractor or subgrantee shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The grantee shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.

(6) When required by the Federal grant program legislation, all construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under this Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less often than once a week. The grantee shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The grantee shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.

(7) Where applicable, all contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 for construction contracts and over $2,500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327&#x2013;330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under section 103 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work day of 8 hours and a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard workday or workweek is permissible if the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 8 hours in any calendar day or 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act applies to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health and safety as determined under construction, safety, and health standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.

(8) Contracts or agreements, the principal purpose of which is to create, develop, or improve products, processes or methods; or for exploration into fields which directly concern public health, safety, or welfare; or constraints in the field of science or technology in which there has been little significant experience outside of work funded by Federal assistance, shall contain a notice to the effect that matters regarding rights to inventions, and materials generated under the contract or agreement are subject to the regulations issued by the Bureau. The contractor shall be advised as to the source of additional information regarding these matters.

(9) All negotiated contracts (except those of $10,000 or less) awarded by grantees shall include a provision to the effect that the grantee, the Bureau, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific grant program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

(10) Contracts and subgrants of amounts over $100,000 shall contain a provision which requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders, or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 1251) as amended. Violations shall be reported to the Bureau and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

##### § 276.13 Indian preference in grant administration.

Any grant or subgrant shall require that to the greatest extent feasible:

(a) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of such a grant or subgrant shall be given to Indians.

(b) Preference in the award of a subgrant, contract or subcontract in connection with administration of a grant shall be given to Indian organizations and economic enterprises.

(c) A tribal governing body may develop its own Indian preference requirements to the extent that such requirements are not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for grants executed under this part.

##### § 276.14 Budget revision.

Criteria and procedures to be followed by grantees in reporting deviations from grant budgets and requesting approval for budget revisions are as follows:

(a) For nonconstruction grants, grantees shall request prior approvals promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:

(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the grant-supported program.

(2) The revision indicates the need for additional Bureau funding.

(3) The grant budget is over $100,000 and the cumulative amount of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is expected to exceed $10,000, or five percent of the grant budget, whichever is greater. The same criteria apply to cumulative amount of transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those intended.

(4) The grant budget is $100,000, or less, and the cumulative amount of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is expected to exceed five percent of the grant budget. The same criteria apply to the cumulative amount of transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those intended.

(5) The revisions involve the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs.

(6) The revisions pertain to the addition of items requiring approval in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this part.

(b) All other changes to nonconstruction grant budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (d) of this section do not require approval. These changes include:

(1) The use of grantee funds in furtherance of program objectives over and above the grantee minimum share included in the approved grant budget and

(2) The transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb authorized increases in indirect costs.

(c) For construction grants, grantees shall request prior approval promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:

(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the grant-supported programs.

(2) The revision increases the budgeted amounts of Bureau funds needed to complete the project.

(d) When the Bureau awards a grant which provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Bureau may require, in the grant agreement, the grantee to request prior approval before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

(e) For both construction and nonconstruction grants, the Bureau shall require tribal grantees to notify the Bureau promptly whenever the amount of Bureau authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the grantee by more than $5,000 or 5 percent of the Bureau grant, whichever is greater. This notification will not be required when applications for additional funding are submitted for continuing grants.

(f) When requesting approval for budget revisions, grantees shall use the budget forms which were used in the grant application. However, grantees may request by letter the approvals required by the provisions of appendix A of this part.

(g) Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Bureau shall review the request and notify the grantee whether or not the budget revisions have been approved. If the Bureau does not reach a decision prior to the end of the 30&#x2013;day period or should the grantee not be notified of the Bureau's decision by the end of the 30-day period the grantee may appeal directly to the Commissioner.

##### § 276.15 Grant closeout.

(a) In closing out Bureau grants, the following shall be observed:

(1) Upon request, the Bureau shall make prompt payments to a grantee for allowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out.

(2) The grantee shall immediately refund to the Bureau any unencumbered balance of cash advanced to the grantee.

(3) The Bureau shall obtain from the grantee within 90 days after the date of completion of the grant all financial, peformance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant. The Bureau may grant extensions when requested by the grantee.

(4) The Bureau shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after these reports are received.

(5) The grantee shall account for any property acquired with grant funds, or received from the Government in accordance with the provisions of § 276.11.

(6) If a final audit has not been performed before the closeout of the grant, the Bureau shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

(b)When a grantee has materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a grant, the Bureau may after reasonable notice to the grantee, suspend the grant. The notice preceding suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the reasons for the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for reinstatement of the grant, and, if there is no immediate threat to safety, a reasonable time frame for corrective action prior to actual suspension. No obligations incurred by the grantee during the period of suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the Bureau may at its discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspensions if such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost principles specified in appendix A of this part. Appropriate adjustments to the payments under the suspended grant will be made, either by withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for disbursements which he may make in liquidation of unauthorized obligations he incurs during the period of suspension. Suspensions shall remain in effect until the grantee has taken corrective action to the satisfaction of the Bureau or given assurances satisfactory to the Bureau that corrective action will be taken, or until the Bureau cancels the grant.

(c)(1)The Bureau may cancel any grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever it is determined that the grantee has:

(i) Materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the grant;

(ii) Violated the rights or endangered the health, safety, or welfare of any persons;

(iii) Been grossly negligent in or has mismanaged the handling or use of funds provided under the grant.

(2) When it appears that cancellation of a grant shall become necessary, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of this possibility. This written notice shall advise the grantee of the reason for the possible cancellation and the corrective action necessary to avoid cancellation. The Bureau shall also offer, and provide if requested by the grantee, any technical assistance which may be required to effect the corrective action. The grantee shall have 60 days in which to effect this corrective action before the Bureau provides notice of intent to cancel the grant as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(3) Upon deciding to cancel for cause, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of that decision, the reasons for the cancellation, and the effective date. The Bureau shall also provide a hearing for the grantee before cancellation, as provided in § 272.51. However, the Bureau may immediately cancel the grant, upon notice to the grantee, if the Bureau determines that continuance of the grant poses an immediate threat to safety. In this event, the Bureau shall provide a hearing for the grantee within ten (10) days of cancellation.

(4) Payments made to grantees or recoveries by the Bureau under grants cancelled for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights and obligations of the parties.

(d)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, grants may be cancelled in whole or in part only as follows:

(i) By the Bureau with the consent of the grantee, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the cancellation conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled; or

(ii) By the grantee, upon written notice to the Bureau, setting forth the reasons for the cancellation, the effective date, and, in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled.

(2) When a grant is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the grantee shall not incur new obligations for the cancelled portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Bureau shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Bureau share of the noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the grantee before cancellation.

##### § 276.16 Subgrants and subcontracts to non-profit organizations.

The uniform administrative requirements in this part, including the cost principles in appendix A, to this part, are applicable to all subgrants or subcontracts made by a grantee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. However, these requirements and cost principles are applicable as minimum standards for subgrants or subcontracts made to nonprofit organizations. Accordingly, the grantee may prescribe additional or more stringent requirements with regard to subgrants or subcontracts made to non-profit organizations.

##### § 276.17 Printing.

As permitted by paragraph 36&#x2013;2(c) in the Government Printing and Binding Regulations (October 1974, No. 23), published by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP), printing required by a grantee in performing work under a grant is considered “incidental printing” (e.g., material which the grantee needs to use to respond to the terms of the grant). Whenever the incidental printing is likely to exceed the exclusions in paragraphs 36&#x2013;3 and 36&#x2013;4 of the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) Printing and Binding Regulations, specific provisions on printing as may be required shall be included in the grant agreement. Grantees shall be given the option of using sources other than the Government Printing Office for incidental printing.

##### § 286.2 Purpose.

The purpose of this part 286 is to prescribe the regulations and procedures under which non-reimbursable grants may be made to eligible applicants to stimulate and increase Indian entrepreneurship and employment through establishment, acquisition or expansion of profit-making Indian-owned economic enterprises which will contribute to the economy of a reservation.

##### § 286.3 Eligible applicants.

Applications for grants may be accepted only from individual Indians, Indian tribes, Indian partnerships, corporations or cooperative associations authorized to do business under State, Federal, or Tribal law. These applicants must have a form of organization acceptable to the Assistant Secretary and unable to meet their total financing needs from their own resources and by loans from other sources such as banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production Credit Associations, and Federal Land Banks. Associations, corporations or partnerships shall be at least fifty-one percent owned by eligible Indians or an eligible Indian tribe. This Indian ownership must actively participate in the management and operation of the economic enterprise by representation on the board of directors of a corporation or cooperative association proportionate to the Indian ownership which will enable the Indian owner(s) to control management decisions. The legal organization documents will provide for the number of Indians which are to be on the board of directors, how they along with other directors will be elected or appointed and qualifications required as a condition for becoming a member of the board of directors. The legal organization documents shall provide safeguards which will prevent Indian ownership and control from decreasing below fifty-one percent. Evidence of Indian ownership in a cooperative association or corporation will be evidenced by stock ownership, if stock is or has been issued, or by other evidence satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary. Partnerships will be evidenced by written partnership agreements which show the percentage of Indian ownership, role and authority in making management decisions in controlling the operation of the economic enterprise.

##### § 286.4 Eligible economic enterprises.

An economic enterprise as defined in § 286.1(k) is eligible to receive equity capital through non-reimbursable grants if it is or will be self-sustaining and profit-oriented and will create employment for Indians. In the case of Indian-owned cooperative associations, they must distribute or allocate profits for later distribution, to members who are patrons, unless prohibited from doing so by law.

##### § 286.5 Information collection.

(a) The collections of information contained in §§ 286.12 and 286.22 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501and assigned clearance number 1076&#x2013;0093. The information will be used to rate applicants in accordance with the priority criteria listed at 25 CFR 286.8. Response to this request is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1521.

(b) Public reporting for this information is estimated to average 45 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Mailstop 337&#x2013;SIB, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1076&#x2013;0093), Washington, DC 20503.

##### § 286.6 [Reserved]

##### § 286.7 Location of enterprise.

To be eligible for a grant an economic enterprise must be located on an Indian reservation or located where it makes or will make an economic contribution to a nearby reservation by providing employment to tribal members residing thereon or by expending a portion of its income for materials or services on the reservation. Economic enterprises which are or will be operated on a reservation must comply with the requirements of applicable rules, resolutions or ordinances adopted by the governing body of the tribe, if applicable.

##### § 286.8 Priority criteria.

The following priority will be used in selecting economic enterprises for grant funding:

(a)First priority will be given to economic enterprises located on a reservation that will:

(1) Utilize Indian resources, both natural and human.

(2) Create the highest ratio of Indian jobs to the total amount of dollars to be invested, including market value of materials and equipment contributed to the project.

(3) Create the highest ratio of income to a tribe or its members in relation to the total amount of dollars to be invested, including market value of materials or equipment contributed to the project.

(4) Generate the most non-Bureau financing.

(b)Second priority will be given to projects located in the immediate vicinity of a reservation that will:

(1) Utilize Indian resources, both natural and human.

(2) Create the highest ratio of Indian jobs to the total amount of dollars to be invested, including market value of materials and equipment contributed to the project.

(3) Generate the most non-Bureau financing.

##### § 286.9 Environmental and flood disaster protection.

Grant funds will not be advanced until there is assurance of compliance with any applicable provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93&#x2013;234), the National Environmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91&#x2013;190), 42 U.S.C. 4321 and Executive Order 11514.

##### § 286.16 Grant approval authority.

Applications for grants require approval by the Assistant Secretary.

##### § 286.17 Grant limitations and requirements.

(a) Grants will be made to assist in establishing new economic enterprises, or in purchasing or expanding established ones. However, a grant may be made only when in the opinion of the Assistant Secretary the applicant is unable to obtain adequate financing from other sources. Prior to making any grant, the Assistant Secretary shall assure that, to the extent practical, the applicant's own resources have been invested in the proposed project. The applicant shall not be required to invest own resources to the extent that they are already committed to endeavors deemed by the Assistant Secretary to be essential to the welfare of the applicant. If the information in an application, which must include personal financial statements, indicates that it may be possible for the applicant to obtain financing without a grant, the Assistant Secretary will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area, if available, who are making loans for similar purpose, showing whether or not they will make a loan to the applicant for the total financing needed without a grant.

(b) A grant may be made only to an applicant who is able to obtain at least 75 percent of the necessary financing from other sources.

(c) No grant in excess of $250,000 may be made to an Indian tribe or in excess of $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.

(d) Revolving loan funds as prescribed in title I of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and guaranteed or insured loans as prescribed in title II of said Act may not be used as the sources of the loan portion of the total financing requirement if financing from other governmental or institutional lenders is available on reasonable terms and conditions. If a loan is not available from other sources, guaranteed or insured loans under the provisions of title II of said Act may then be considered. If a guaranteed or insured loan is not available loans under the provisions of title I of said Act may then be considered. Applicants for a loan from either source must meet the eligibility requirements for such loans.

(e) A grant will not be approved unless there is assurance the applicant can and will be provided with needed competent technical and management assistance commensurate with the nature of the enterprise to be funded and the knowledge and management skills of the applicant.

(f) Grant funds may not be used for refinancing or debt consolidation unless approval is justified and required due to the applicant's financial position and is clearly to the advantage of the grant applicant.

(g) Ordinarily, not more than one grant will be made for a project. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances a second grant may be made to applicants for a new project or expansion of the original project. An additional grant will not be approved for an economic enterprise previously funded under the provisions of title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 except for expanding a successful enterprise, provided the total of grants made shall not exceed $250,000 to an Indian tribe and $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.

(h) An application for a second grant will not be approved if the applicant:

(1) Has not complied with the reporting requirements in connection with the first grant, or

(2) Has not followed the plan of operation, if any, developed for the management and operation of the economic enterprise, or

(3) Did not follow and use the management and technical assistance furnished, or

(4) Is in violation of one or more provisions of the loan agreement entered into between the applicant and the lender who furnished the loan portion of the financing in connection with the first grant.

(i) An applicant for an expansion grant must meet the same eligibility requirements as an original applicant.

(j) A grantee will be required to return all or a portion of the grant if the business or enterprise for which the grant was utilized is sold within three years of the date on which the grant was disbursed to the grantee, unless the proceeds from the sale are re-invested in a new business or business expansion which will benefit the Indian reservation economy. Such sale and re-investment must have the prior approval of the local agency superintendent. The grantee shall refund the lessor of the grant amount or a pro rata portion of sales proceeds. The pro rata portion of sales proceeds shall be based on the ratio of grant amount to its corresponding matching financing. The new business or business expansion utilizing such sale proceeds must meet the same criteria for eligibility as an original grant.

##### § 286.18 Written notice.

The applicant for a grant which is disapproved will be notified by letter, stating the reasons for disapproval and the right of appeal pursuant to 25 CFR 2. A copy of the letter will be sent to the prospective lender.

##### § 286.19 [Reserved]

##### § 286.20 Disbursement of grant funds.

Unless otherwise provided by an agreement between a lender and the grantee, the Assistant Secretary may in his discretion advance grant funds directly to a grantee. He may require the funds to be deposited in a special account at the appropriate Agency headquarters office or deposited in a joint account in a bank and disbursed as needed by the grantee. The terms of a lender's loan agreement may require the lender's approval before disbursement of the funds. Grant funds will not be disbursed to a grantee until the Assistant Secretary has been informed by the lender that a loan has been approved for the grantee in the amount of the loan financing needed.

##### § 286.21 Return of unused funds.

Grantees will be required to return unused grant funds to the Assistant Secretary if the economic enterprise for which the grant was approved is not initiated, i.e., lease obtained, if needed, construction started, equipment purchased or other, within the time stated in the grant agreement. The Assistant Secretary may, if warranted by circumstances beyond the control of the grantee, extend the time to allow for initiation of the enterprise, provided there is assurance the enterprise will be initiated forthwith within the extended time period. The Assistant Secretary will notify the lender in writing of a proposed action to require the return of grant funds or of a proposal to extend the time.

##### § 286.22 Reports.

(a) Grantees are required to furnish the Assistant Secretary comparative balance sheets and profit and loss statements semi-annually for the first two years of operation following receipt of the grant, and annually thereafter for the succeeding three years. These may be copied of financial statements required by and furnished to the lender which provided the loan portion of the total financing required. If the lender does not require financial statements, the grantee must prepare and furnish copies of comparative balance sheets and profit and loss statements to the Assistant Secretary.

(b) The Assistant Secretary will establish accounting and reporting systems which will appropriately show the status of the Indian Business Development Program at all times.

### PART 309 - PROTECTION OF INDIAN ARTS AND CRAFTS PRODUCTS

#### § 309.1 How do the regulations in this part carry out the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990?

These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (18 U.S.C. 1159, 25 U.S.C. 305) from false representations, and specify how the Indian Arts and Crafts Board will interpret certain conduct for enforcement purposes. The Act makes it unlawful to offer or display for sale or sell any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian, or Indian tribe, or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the United States.

#### § 309.2 What are the key definitions for purposes of the Act?

(a)as applied to an individual means a person who is a member of an Indian tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the provisions of § 309.4).

(b)means an individual who is certified by an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan.

(c)means any legally established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members of Indian tribes.

(d)&#x2014;(1)The term “Indian product” means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the term “made by an Indian” means that an Indian has provided the artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the Indian art or craft object to be an “Indian product.”

(2)The term “Indian product” includes, but is not limited to:

(i) Art made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;

(ii) Craft work made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non-traditional style or medium;

(iii) Handcraft made by an Indian,an object created with the help of only such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to condition the shape and design of each individual product.

(3)An “Indian product” under the Act does not include any of the following, for example:

(i) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product made by non-Indian labor;

(ii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is designed by an Indian but produced by non-Indian labor;

(iii) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is assembled from a kit;

(iv) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product originating from a commercial product, without substantial transformation provided by Indian artistic or craft work labor;

(v) Industrial products, which for this purpose are defined as goods that have an exclusively functional purpose, do not serve as a traditional artistic medium, and that do not lend themselves to Indian embellishment, such as appliances and vehicles. An industrial product may not become an Indian product.

(vi) A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that is produced in an assembly line or related production line process using multiple workers not all whom are Indians. For example, if twenty people make up the labor to create the product(s), and one person is not Indian, the product is not an “Indian product.”

(e)means&#x2014;

(1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or

(2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.

(f)means that the origin of a product is identified as a named Indian tribe or named Indian arts and crafts organization.

#### § 309.6 When does a commercial product become an Indian product?

In addressing Indian embellishments to originally commercial products, the Indian labor expended to add art or craft work to those objects must be sufficient to substantially transform the qualities and appearance of the original commercial item. “Commercial products,” under this part, are consumer goods designed for profit and mass distribution that lend themselves to Indian embellishment, for example clothing and accessories. Through substantial transformation due to Indian labor, a product changes from a commercial product to an Indian product. Examples of formerly commercial products that become Indian products include tennis shoes to which an Indian applies beadwork and denim jackets to which an Indian applies ribbon appliqu&#xE9;s.

#### § 309.7 How should a seller disclose the nature and degree of Indian labor when selling, offering, or displaying art and craft work for sale?

The Indian Arts and Crafts Act is a truth-in-marketing law. Those who produce and market art and craft work should honestly represent and clarify the degree of Indian involvement in the production of the art and craft work when it is sold, displayed or offered for sale. The following guidelines illustrate the way in which art and craft work may be characterized for marketing purposes and gives examples of products that may be marketed as Indian products.

#### § 309.8 For marketing purposes, what is the recommended method of identifying authentic Indian products?

(a) The recommended method of marketing authentic Indian products is to include the name of the artist or artisan, the name of the Tribe in which the artist or artisan is enrolled, and the individual's Tribal enrollment number. If the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan, rather than an enrolled Tribal member, the product identification should include the name of the Tribe providing official written certification that the individual is a non-member Indian artisan and the date upon which such certification was issued by the Tribe. In order for an individual to be certified by an Indian Tribe as a non-member Indian artisan, the individual must be of Indian lineage of one or more members of such Indian Tribe and the certification must be issued in writing by the governing body of an Indian Tribe or by a certifying body delegated this function by the governing body of the Indian Tribe.

(b) For example, the Indian product should include a label, hangtag, provenance card, or similar identification that includes W (name of the artist or artisan), and X (name of the Tribe in which the individual is enrolled) and Y (individual's Tribal enrollment number), or a statement that the individual is a certified non-member Indian artisan of Z (name of the Tribe providing certification and the date upon which the certification was issued by the Tribe).

###### § 513.5 What is the Commission's policy on interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs?

(a) Interest.

(1) The Commission will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.

(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. The Commission will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717.

(b) Penalties. The Commission will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any portion of a delinquent debt.

(c) Administrative costs. The Commission will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of the debtor's failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the cost of providing a copy of the file to the debtor and costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Commission.

(d) Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue throughout any appeal process.

(e) Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.

(f) Additional authority. The Commission may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.

(g) Waiver. (1) Regardless of the amount of the debt, the Chairman may decide to waive collection of all or part of the accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs if collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Commission's best interest.

(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, when charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Chairman's decision whether to waive collection of these charges is final and not subject to further review.

###### § 513.6 What are the requirements for offset review?

(a) The Commission will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Commission determines that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence.

(b) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Commission will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

(c) When an oral hearing is not required, the Commission will review the request for reconsideration based on the written record.

###### § 513.7 What is the Commission's policy on revoking a debtor's ability to engage in Indian gaming for failure to pay a debt?

The Chairman of the Commission may revoke a debtor's ability to operate, manage, or otherwise participate in the operation of an Indian gaming facility if the debtor inexcusably or willfully fails to pay a debt. The revocation of ability to engage in gaming may last only as long as the debtor's indebtedness.

###### § 513.20 What debts can the Commission refer to Treasury for collection by administrative and tax refund offset?

(a) The Commission may refer any past due, legally enforceable nonjudgment debt of a person to the Treasury for administrative and tax refund offset if the debt:

(2) The debtor has 60 calendar days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable; and

(3) The debtor has an opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

##### Subpart C - Salary Offset

###### § 513.30 When may the Commission use salary offset to collect debts?

(a) The Commission collects debts owed by employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset under the authority of: 5 U.S.C. 5514; 31 U.S.C. 3716; 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; and this subpart. Salary offset is applicable when the Commission is attempting to collect a debt owed by an individual employed by the Commission or another agency.

(d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly prohibited by another statute.

(e) This subpart's regulations covering notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions do not apply to:

(1) Any routine intra-agency adjustment in pay that is attributable to clerical or administrative error or delay in processing pay documents that have occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, or any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less. However, at the time of any adjustment, or as soon thereafter as possible, the Commission's payroll agency will provide the employee with a written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a contact point for appealing the adjustment.

(2) Any negative adjustment to pay that arises from the debtor's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four or fewer pay periods. However, at the time of the adjustment, the Commission's payroll agent will provide in the debtor's earnings statement a clear statement informing the debtor of the previous overpayment.

(f) An employee's involuntary payment of all or any of the debt through salary offset will not be construed as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under the law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

(3) The amount of the debt and the facts giving rise to it;

(4) The frequency and the amount of the intended deduction stated as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of pay not to exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay, and the intention to continue the deductions until the debt and all accumulated interest are paid in full or resolved;

(5) The name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom the debtor may propose a written alternative schedule for voluntary repayment in lieu of salary offset. The debtor must include a justification for the alternative schedule in the proposal;

(6) The Commission's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, set out at § 513.5, and a statement that assessments will be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS;

(7) Notice of the employee's right to inspect and copy all Commission records pertaining to the debt and the name, address, and telephone number of the Commission employee to whom requests for access must be made;

(8) Notice of the employee's opportunity to a hearing conducted by an individual who does not work for the Commission on the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of the repayment schedule;

(9) Notice that filing a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following the debtor's receiving the Notice of Intent will stay collection proceedings and that a final decision will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition for hearing, unless the employee requests, and a hearing official grants, a delay in proceedings;

(10) An explanation of the effect of submitting knowingly false or frivolous statements; and

(11) Notice that amounts paid on or deducted from debts that are later waived or found not to be owed will be promptly refunded to the employee.

###### § 513.32 What are the hearing procedures when the Commission is the creditor agency?

(a) To request a hearing, the debtor must file, within 15 days of receiving the Commission's notice of intent to offset, a written petition signed by the debtor and addressed to the Commission stating why the debtor believes the Commission's determination of the existence or amount of the debt is in error. The Commission may waive the 15-day time limit for filing a request for hearing if the employee shows that the delay was due to circumstances beyond his or her control or because the employee did not receive notice of the 15-day time limit. A debtor who has previously obtained a hearing to contest a debt that arose from a notice of violation or proposed civil fine assessment matters under 25 CFR parts 580 through 585 may not re-litigate matters that were at issue in that hearing.

(b) Regardless of whether the debtor is a Commission employee, the Commission will provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official who is not from the Commission.

(c) The hearing will be conducted according to the FCCS review requirements at 31 CFR 901.3(e).

(d) Unless the employee requests, and a hearing official grants, a delay in proceedings, within 60 days after the petition for hearing the hearing official will issue a written decision on:

(1) The determination of the creditor agency concerning the existence or amount of the debt; and

(2) The repayment schedule, if a schedule was not established by written agreement between the employee and the creditor agency.

(e) If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected by salary offset but the Commission has determined that the debt is valid, the Commission may seek collection of the debt through other means in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

(f) The form of hearings, written responses, and final decisions will be according to the Commission's review requirements at § 513.7. Written decisions regarding salary offset that are provided after a request for hearing must state: The facts purported to evidence the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the employee's or creditor agency's grounds; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where applicable, the repayment schedule.

###### § 513.33 Will the Commission issue a certification when the Commission is the creditor agency?

(a) In response to a Notice of Intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt voluntarily in lieu of salary offset by submitting a written proposed repayment schedule to the Commission. A proposal must be received by the Commission within 15 calendar days after the employee is sent the Notice of Intent.

(b) The Commission will notify the employee whether, within the Commission's discretion, the proposed repayment schedule is acceptable.

(a)(1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Commission of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.

(2) The request for special review must include an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a detailed statement, with supporting documents, that shows why the current salary offset or payment results in extreme financial hardship to the employee, spouse, or dependents. The statement must indicate:

(i) Income from all sources;

(ii) Assets;

(iii) Liabilities;

(iv) Number of dependents;

(v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;

(vi) Medical expenses; and

(vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.

(b) The Commission will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Commission will notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of its determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.

(e) The Commission will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.

(f) The Commission's payroll officer will determine the amount of the debtor's disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.

(g) The Commission may use the following types of salary debt collection:

(1) Lump sum offset. If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump sum offset.

(2) Installment deductions. The amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the debtor has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will liquidate the debt in three years or less.

(3) Deductions from final check. A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.

(4) Deductions from other sources. If an employee subject to salary offset is leaving the Commission and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, then the Commission may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards.

(h) When two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, the Commission's payroll office may, in its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.

The request must be signed and must either be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, which is a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to assist in the identification and location of requested records, a request may also, at the requester's option, include a social security number.

(e)When making a request as a parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, the request must establish:

(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;

(2) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;

(3) That the requester is the parent or guardian of the individual and proof of such relationship by providing a birth certificate showing parentage or a court order establishing guardianship; and

(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.

(f)Any individual who desires to have a record covered by this part disclosed to or mailed to another person may designate such person and authorize such person to act as his or her agent for that specific purpose. The authorization shall be in writing, signed by the individual whose record is requested, and notarized or witnessed as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

(g)An individual to whom a record is to be disclosed in person, pursuant to this section, may have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him or her when the record is disclosed. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.

##### § 515.4 Responsibility for responding to requests.

(a)In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the Privacy Act Officer shall inform the requester of that date.

(b)The Privacy Act Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part access to records.

(c)When the Commission receives a request for a record in its possession, the Privacy Act Officer shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the Privacy Act Officer determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:

(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or

(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it, or to another agency that originated the record. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.

(d)Whenever the Privacy Act Officer refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.

##### § 515.5 Responses to requests for access to records.

(a)Upon receipt of a request, the Privacy Act Officer ordinarily shall, within 20 working days, send an acknowledgement letter which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 515.9 and provide an assigned request number.

(b)Once the Privacy Act Officer makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The notice shall inform the requester of any fee charged under § 515.9 of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the Privacy Act Officer will disclose the records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.

(c)If the Privacy Act Officer makes any adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. The notification letter shall be signed by the official making the determination and include:

(1) The name and title of the person responsible for the denial;

(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied to the denial;

(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 515.7 and a description of the requirements of § 515.7.

##### § 515.6 Request for amendment or correction of records.

(a)An individual may make a request for an amendment or correction to a Commission record about that individual by writing directly to the Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3. The request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that is sought, and state why the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The request may include any documentation that would be helpful to substantiate the reasons for the amendment sought.

(b)The Privacy Act Officer shall, not later than 10 working days after receipt of a request for an amendment or correction of a record, acknowledge receipt of the request and provide notification of whether the request is granted or denied. If the request is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall describe the amendment or correction made and shall advise the requester of the right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record. If the request is denied in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer shall send a letter signed by the denying official stating:

(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and

(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section.

(c)A requester may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in § 515.7. If the appeal is denied, the requester shall be advised of the right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of the right under the Privacy Act for judicial review of the decision.

(d)If the appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, the requester has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states the reason(s) for disagreeing with the Privacy Act Officer's denial of the request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. The Statement of Disagreement shall be placed in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and the record shall be marked to indicate a Statement of Disagreement has been filed.

(e)Within 30 working days of the amendment or correction of the record, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, and if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If a Statement of Disagreement was filed, the Commission shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend the record.

(f)Section 515.13 lists the records that are exempt from amendment or correction.

##### § 515.7 Appeals of initial adverse agency determination.

(a)An initial adverse agency determination of a request may consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that the requested record is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination that a record will not be amended; a determination to deny a request for an accounting; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and any associated denial of a request for expedited treatment under the Commission's FOIA regulations.

(b)If the Privacy Act Officer issues an adverse determination in response to a request, the requester may file a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by the original request, the initial adverse determination that is being appealed, and a statement describing why the adverse determination was in error. The appeal shall be addressed to the Privacy Act Appeals Officer at the locations listed in § 515.3 of this part no later than 90 calendar days after the date of the letter denying the request. Both the appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Privacy Act Appeal.” Any Privacy Act appeals submitted via electronic mail should state “Privacy Act Appeal” in the subject line.

(c)The decision on appeal will be made in writing within 20 working days of receipt of the notice of appeal by the Privacy Act Appeals Officer. For good cause shown, however, the Privacy Act Appeals Officer may extend the 20 day working period. If such an extension is taken, the requester shall be promptly notified of such extension and the anticipated date of decision. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the determination, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision. The response to the appeal shall also advise of the right to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of the decision.

(d)In order to institute a civil action in a federal district court for judicial review of an adverse determination, a requester must first appeal it under this section.

##### § 515.8 Requests for an accounting of record disclosure.

(a)Subject to the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual may make a request for an accounting of the disclosures of any record about that individual that the Commission has made to another person, organization, or agency. The accounting contains the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made in writing to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in § 515.3.

(b)The Commission is not required to provide an accounting where they relate to:

(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept, such as those that are made to employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties and disclosures that are made under section 552 of title 5;

(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or

(3) Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements.

(c)A requester may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in § 515.7 of this part and the same procedures will be followed.

(d)All accountings made under this section will be retained for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.

##### § 515.9 Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.

(a)When a record pertaining to an individual is required to be disclosed by a court order, the Privacy Act Officer shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice of this to the individual. Notice shall be given within a reasonable time after the Privacy Act Officer's receipt of the order&#x2014;except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice shall be given only after the order becomes public. This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and shall contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice shall not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.

(b)Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an individual made under compelling circumstances affecting health or safety, the Privacy Act Officer shall, within a reasonable time, notify that individual of the disclosure. This notice shall be mailed to the individual's last known address and shall state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying disclosure.

##### § 515.10 Fees.

The Commission shall charge fees for duplication of records under the Privacy Act in the same way in which it charges duplication fees under § 517.9 of this chapter. No search or review fee may be charged for any record. Additionally, when the Privacy Act Officer makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of reviewing the record or granting access to the record, the Commission shall not charge for the cost of making that copy. Otherwise, the Commission may charge a fee sufficient to cover the cost of duplicating a record.

##### § 515.11 Penalties.

Any person who makes a false statement in connection with any request for access to a record, or an amendment thereto, under this part, is subject to the penalties prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 494 and 495.

##### § 515.12 [Reserved]

##### § 515.13 Specific exemptions.

(a) The following systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (f):

(1) Indian Gaming Individuals Records System.

(2) Management Contract Individuals Record System.

(b) The exemptions under paragraph (a) of this section apply only to the extent that information in these systems is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). When compliance would not appear to interfere with or adversely affect the overall responsibilities of the Commission, with respect to licensing of key employees and primary management officials for employment in an Indian gaming operation or verifying the suitability of an individual who has a financial interest in, or management responsibility for a management contract, the applicable exemption may be waived by the Commission.

(c) Exemptions from the particular sections are justified for the following reasons:

(1) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), because making available the accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of a record could reveal investigative interest. This would permit the individual to take measures to destroy evidence, intimidate potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid the investigation.

(2) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(1), and (f) concerning individual access to records, when such access could compromise classified information related to national security, interfere with a pending investigation or internal inquiry, constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or pose a potential threat to the Commission or its employees or to law enforcement personnel. Additionally, access could reveal the identity of a source who provided information under an express promise of confidentiality.

(3) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), because to require the Commission to amend information thought to be incorrect, irrelevant, or untimely, because of the nature of the information collected and the length of time it is maintained, would create an impossible administrative and investigative burden by continually forcing the Commission to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.

(4) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) because:

(i) It is not always possible to determine relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation.

(ii) Relevance and necessity are matters of judgment and timing in that what appears relevant and necessary when collected may be deemed unnecessary later. Only after information is assessed can its relevance and necessity be established.

(iii) In any investigation the Commission may receive information concerning violations of law under the jurisdiction of another agency. In the interest of effective law enforcement and under 25 U.S.C. 2716(b), the information could be relevant to an investigation by the Commission.

(iv) In the interviewing of individuals or obtaining evidence in other ways during an investigation, the Commission could obtain information that may or may not appear relevant at any given time; however, the information could be relevant to another investigation by the Commission.

#### PART 516 - TESTIMONY OF COMMISSIONERS AND EMPLOYEES AND FORMER COMMISSIONERS AND FORMER EMPLOYEES RESPECTING OFFICIAL DUTIES; RESPONSE TO SUBPOENA

##### § 516.1 What is the purpose of this part and to whom does it apply?

(a) The purpose of this part is to promulgate regulations regarding the release of official National Indian Gaming Commission information and provision of testimony by National Indian Gaming Commission personnel with respect to litigation or potential litigation and to prescribe conduct on the part of National Indian Gaming Commission personnel in response to a litigation-related request or demand.

(b) This part applies to requests or demands that are litigation-related or otherwise arise out of judicial, administrative or other legal proceedings (including subpoena, order or other demand) for interview, testimony (including by deposition) or other statement, or for production of documents relating to the business of the National Indian Gaming Commission, whether or not the National Indian Gaming Commission or the United States is a party to the litigation. It does not, however, apply to document requests covered by 25 CFR parts 515 and 517.

(c) To the extent the request or demand seeks official information or documents, the provisions of this part are applicable to Commissioners, employees, and former Commissioners and former employees, of the National Indian Gaming Commission.

##### § 516.2 When may a person to whom this part applies give testimony, make a statement or submit to interview?

(a) No person to whom this part applies, except as authorized by the Chairman or the General Counsel pursuant to this regulation, shall provide testimony, make a statement or submit to interview.

(b) Whenever a subpoena commanding the giving of any testimony has been lawfully served upon a person to whom this part applies, such individual shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Chairman or the General Counsel, appear in response thereto and respectfully decline to testify on the grounds that it is prohibited by this regulation.

(c) A person who desires testimony or other statement from any person to whom this part applies may make written request therefor, verified by oath, directed to the Chairman setting forth his or her interest in the matter to be disclosed and designating the use to which such statement or testimony will be put in the event of compliance with such request: provided, that a written request therefor by an official of any federal, state or tribal entity, acting in his or her official capacity need not be verified by oath. If it is determined by the Chairman or the General Counsel that such statement or testimony will be in the public interest, the request may be granted. Where a request for a statement or testimony is granted, one or more persons to whom this part applies may be authorized or designated to appear and testify or give a statement with respect thereto.

##### § 516.3 When may a person to whom this part applies produce records?

(a) Any request for records of the National Indian Gaming Commission shall be handled pursuant to the procedures established in 25 CFR parts 515 and 517 and shall comply with the rules governing public disclosure as provided in 25 CFR parts 515 and 517.

(b) Whenever a subpoena duces tecum commanding the production of any record has been lawfully served upon a person to whom this part applies, such person shall forward the subpoena to the General Counsel. If commanded to appear in response to any such subpoena, a person to whom this part applies shall respectfully decline to produce the record on the ground that production is prohibited by this part and state that the production of the record(s) of the National Indian Gaming Commission is a matter to be determined by the Chairman or the General Counsel.

##### § 516.4 How are records certified or authenticated?

(a) Upon request, the person having custody and responsibility for maintenance of records which are to be released under this part or 25 CFR parts 515 or 517 may certify the authenticity of copies of records that are requested to be provided in such format.

(b) A request for certified copies of records or for authentication of copies of records shall be sent to the following address: NIGC Attn: Freedom of Information Act Officer, C/O Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop #1621, Washington, DC 20240.

#### PART 517 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROCEDURES

##### § 517.1 General provisions.

This part contains the regulations the National Indian Gaming Commission (Commission) follows in implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These regulations provide procedures by which you may obtain access to records compiled, created, and maintained by the Commission, along with procedures the Commission must follow in response to such requests for records. These regulations should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records maintained by the Commission. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a), are processed in accordance with the Commission's Privacy Act regulations, 25 CFR part 515, as well as under this part.

##### § 517.2 Public reading room.

Records that are required to be maintained by the Commission shall be available for public inspection and copying at 90 K Street NE, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002. Reading room records created on or after November 1, 1996, shall be made available electronically via the Commission's website.

##### § 517.3 Definitions.

(a)means a requester seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of himself or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category, the FOIA Officer shall determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Officer shall contact the requester for additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

(b)means records or information provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

(c)mean those expenditures by the Commission actually incurred in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in response to the FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee or employees performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.

(d)refers to the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of, among other things, paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or electronic records (compact discs or USB flash drives). The copies provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.

(e)refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary school, an institute of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institute of professional education, or an institute of vocational education which operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.

(f)means the person designated by the Chairman to administer the FOIA.

(g)refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is used in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.

(h)means an agency record that is either created or obtained by an agency and is under agency control at the time of the FOIA request.

(i)means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available for purchase by or free distribution to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. For a “freelance journalist” to be regarded as working for a news organization, the requester must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, such as a publication contract. Absent such showing, the requester may provide documentation establishing the requester's past publication record. To qualify for this category, the requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting a news-dissemination function shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.

(j)means any person, including an individual, Indian tribe, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a Federal agency, that requests access to records in the possession of the Commission.

(k)means the process of examining a record in response to a FOIA request to determine if any portion of that record may be withheld under one or more of the FOIA Exemptions. It also includes processing any record for disclosure, for example, redacting information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under § 517.7(c). Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the use of FOIA Exemptions.

(l)refers to the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within a document and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA Officer shall ensure that searches are conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.

(m)means any person or entity who provides information directly or indirectly to the Commission. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, Indian tribal governments, state governments and foreign governments.

(n)means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.

##### § 517.4 Requirements for making requests.

(a)Requests for records made pursuant to the FOIA must be in writing. Requests may be mailed, dropped off in person, or faxed to (202) 632&#x2013;7066 (not a toll free number). Requests that are dropped off in person should be made at 90 K Street NE, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20002 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Requests that are mailed should be sent to NIGC Attn: FOIA Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mail Stop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Requests may also be sent via electronic mail addressed toor submitted through the Commission's website.

(b)If the requester is making a request for records about himself/herself, the requester must provide verification of identity. Verification requirements are described in 25 CFR 515.3.

(c)If the requester is making a request for records about another individual, the requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of the death certificate or a copy of the obituary).

(d)Requests for records shall describe the records requested with as much specificity as possible to enable Commission employees to locate the information requested with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should describe the subject matter of the records sought, the time periods in which the records were generated, and any tribe or tribal gaming facility with which they were associated. Before submitting a request, requesters may contact the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records being sought and receive assistance describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA Officer determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA Officer must inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the Commission's FOIA contact or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.

(e)Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. If the requester is requesting a waiver or reduction of fees the requester must include justification for such waiver or reduction (see § 517.9(c) for more information). If the request for a fee waiver is denied, the requester will be notified of this decision and advised that fees associated with the processing of the request will be assessed. The requester must send an acknowledgment to the FOIA Officer indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request will be administratively closed.

(f)Requesters may specify their preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. The Commission will accommodate such requests where the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.

(g)The FOIA does not require the Commission to:

(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;

(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or

(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed.

##### § 517.5 Responsibility for responding to requests.

(a)In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of that date.

(b)The FOIA Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part a request for records.

(c)When the FOIA Officer determines that the requested records shall be made available, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester in writing and provide copies of the requested records in whole or in part. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show the exemption applied to the withheld information and the amount of information withheld unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption. If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempt material, all reasonable segregable material shall be disclosed.

(d)If the FOIA Officer makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it must notify the requester of that adverse determination in writing. Adverse determinations include decisions that: The requested record is exempt from release, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; denials involving fees or fee waiver matters; and denials of requests for expedited processing.

(e)Any adverse determination issued by the FOIA Officer must include:

(1) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying access to a record unless to do so would harm the interest protected by an applicable exemption;

(2) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

(3) A statement that the adverse determination may be appealed under § 517.8 of this part and a description of the appeal requirements; and

(4) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.

(f)When reviewing records located in response to a request, the FOIA Officer will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any record determined to be better suited for review by another Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer must proceed in one of the following ways.

(1)When records originating with the Commission contain information of interest to another Federal Government agency, the FOIA Officer should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.

(2)(i) When the FOIA Officer believes that a different Federal Government agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the FOIA Officer should typically refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. If the Commission and another Federal Government agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever the FOIA Officer refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, he or she must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral.

(iii) After the FOIA Officer refers a record to another Federal Government agency, the agency receiving the referral shall make a disclosure determination and respond directly to the requester. The referral of a record is not an adverse determination and no appeal rights accrue to the requester by this act.

(3)The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy interests. For example, if the FOIA Officer in responding to a request for records on a living third party locates records originating with a criminal law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the FOIA Officer should coordinate with the originating agency to obtain its views on whether the record may be disclosed. The FOIA Officer should then convey the determination as to whether the record will be released to the requester.

##### § 517.6 Timing of responses to requests.

(a)The FOIA Officer ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt. All statutory and regulatory timelines will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office that is designated to receive requests in § 517.4(a). In instances of requests misdirected to Commission field offices, the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the Commission's Headquarters FOIA Office, but in any event no later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any Commission office.

(b)(1) The FOIA Officer may use multi-track processing in responding to requests. Multi-track processing means placing simple requests requiring rather limited review in one processing track and placing more voluminous and complex requests in one or more other tracks. Requests in either track are processed on a first-in/first-out basis.

(2) The FOIA Officer may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of faster track(s). The FOIA Officer will do so either by contacting the requester by letter, telephone, electronic mail, or facsimile whichever is more efficient in each case. When providing a requester with the opportunity to limit the scope of their request, the FOIA Officer shall also advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any dispute arising between the requester and the Commission as well as the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

(c)(1) The FOIA Officer shall make an initial determination regarding access to the requested information and notify the requester within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the request. This 20 day period may be extended if unusual circumstances arise. If an extension is necessary, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the extension, briefly stating the reasons for the extension, and estimating when the FOIA Officer will respond. Unusual circumstances warranting extension are:

(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of records which are demanded in a single request; or

(iii) The need for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, which consultation shall be conducted with all practicable speed.

(2) If the FOIA Officer decides that an initial determination cannot be reached within the time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the reasons for the delay and include an estimate of when a determination will be made. The requester will then have the opportunity to modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame for completion of the request. To assist in this process, the FOIA Officer shall advise the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to aid in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Commission, and notify the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

(3) If no initial determination has been made at the end of the 20 day period provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including any extension, the requester may appeal the action to the FOIA Appeals Officer.

(d)(1) A requester may make a request for expedited processing at any time.

(2) When a request for expedited processing is received, the FOIA Officer must determine whether to grant the request for expedited processing within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt. Requests will receive expedited processing if one of the following compelling needs is met:

(i) The requester can establish that failure to receive the records quickly could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

(ii) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information and can demonstrate that an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity exists.

(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. As a matter of administrative discretion, the FOIA Officer may waive the formal certification requirement.

(4) Administrative appeals of denials of expedited processing will be given expeditious consideration. If the denial of expedited processing is upheld by the FOIA Appeals Officer, that decision is immediately subject to judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.

##### § 517.7 Confidential commercial information.

(a)The FOIA Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter who provides confidential commercial information to the Commission, with prompt notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing the confidential commercial information if the Commission may be required to disclose the information under the FOIA. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the confidential commercial information. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that notice and opportunity to object has been given to the submitter.

(b)Notice shall be given to a submitter when:

(1) The information has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure. Submitters of confidential commercial information shall use good faith efforts to designate, either at the time of submission or a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions they deem protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Such designation shall be deemed to have expired ten years after the date of submission, unless the requester provides reasonable justification for a designation period of greater duration; or

(2) The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

(c)If the FOIA Officer has reason to believe that information submitted to the Commission may be protected from disclosure under any other exemption of the FOIA, the FOIA Officer may, in his or her discretion, provide the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to the release of that information.

(d)The FOIA Officer shall afford a submitter a reasonable period of time to provide the FOIA Officer with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA, and if Exemption 4 applies, shall demonstrate the reasons the submitter believes the information to be confidential commercial information that is exempt from disclosure. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter. In the event a submitter fails to respond to the notice in the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is received after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

(e)The FOIA Officer shall carefully consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information requested. Whenever the FOIA Officer determines that disclosure is appropriate, the FOIA Officer shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to disclosure, provide the submitter with written notice of the intent to disclose which shall include a statement of the reasons for which the submitter's objections were overruled, a description of the information to be disclosed, and a specific disclosure date. The FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester that the requested records will be made available.

(f)If the requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the submitter of this action. If a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent disclosure of confidential commercial information, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester.

(g)The notice requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply if:

(1) The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be disclosed pursuant to Exemption 4 and/or any other exemption of the FOIA;

(2) The information lawfully has been published or officially made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the FOIA);

(4) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with this part, when the submitter had the opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or

(5) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with this part appears obviously frivolous. When the FOIA Officer determines that a submitter was frivolous in designating information as confidential, the FOIA Officer must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date, but no opportunity to object to disclosure will be offered.

##### § 517.8 Appeals.

(a)The requester has the right to appeal to the FOIA Appeals Officer any adverse determination.

(b)&#x2014;(1)To be considered timely, an appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the date of the response or after the time limit for response by the FOIA Officer has expired. Prior to submitting an appeal any outstanding fees associated with FOIA requests must be paid in full.

(2)An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the original request and adverse determination. To expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to present his/her arguments, the notice should contain a brief statement of the reasons why the requester believes the adverse determination to have been in error. Requesters may submit appeals by mail, facsimile, or electronically. Appeals sent by mail shall be addressed to the National Indian Gaming Commission, Attn: FOIA Appeals Officer, 1849 C Street NW, Mailstop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. Appeals may also be submitted via electronic mail ator through the NIGC's website. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

(c)The FOIA Appeals Officer shall issue a final written determination, stating the basis for its decision, within twenty (20) working days after receipt of a notice of appeal. If the determination is to provide access to the requested records, the FOIA Officer shall make those records immediately available to the requester. If the determination upholds the adverse determination, the FOIA Appeals Officer shall notify the requester of the determination, the ability to obtain mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and the right to obtain judicial review in the appropriate Federal district court.

(d)Before seeking review by a court of the FOIA Officer's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

##### § 517.9 Fees.

(a)Fees pursuant to the FOIA shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for services rendered by the Commission in response to requests for records under this part. All fees shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of fees should be by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

(b)The following fees shall be assessed in responding to requests for records submitted under this part, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:

(1)The FOIA Officer will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where he or she can readily reproduce the record in the form or format requested. When photocopies are supplied, the FOIA Officer shall charge $0.15 per page for copies of documents up to 8x 14. For copies of records produced on tapes, compact discs, or other media, the FOIA Officer shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other methods of reproduction, the FOIA Officer shall charge the actual direct costs of producing the documents.

(2)&#x2014;(i)Whenever feasible, the FOIA Officer will charge at the salary rate (basic pay plus 16% percent for benefits) of the employee or employees performing the search. However, where a homogenous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (all administrative/clerical or all professional/executive), the FOIA Officer shall charge $4.45 per quarter hour for clerical time and $7.75 per quarter hour for professional time. Charges for search time less than a full hour will be in increments of quarter hours.

(ii)The FOIA Officer will charge the actual direct costs of conducting computer searches. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for requested records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. For requests that require the creation of a new computer program to locate requested records, the Commission will charge the direct costs associated with such program's creation. The FOIA Officer must notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

(3)Review fees shall be assessed only with respect to those requesters who seek records for a commercial use under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed at the same rates as those listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record review, for example, review undertaken when the FOIA Officer analyzes the applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or portion thereof at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied.

(c)Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge below that listed in paragraph (b) of this section where it is determined, based upon information provided by a requester or otherwise made known to the FOIA Officer, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. Disclosure is in the public interest if it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and is not primarily for commercial purposes. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case by case basis. In order to determine whether the fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA Officer shall consider the following six factors:

(1)Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;

(2)Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;

(3)Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding;

(4)Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;

(5)Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so

(6)Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

(d)There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutional requesters; representative of the news media; and all other requesters. These terms are defined in § 517.3. The following specific levels of fees are prescribed for each of these categories:

(1)The FOIA Officer shall charge commercial use requesters the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.

(2)The FOIA Officer shall charge educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters for document duplication only, except that the first 100 pages of copies shall be provided without charge.

(3)The FOIA Officer shall charge news media requesters for document duplication costs only, except that the first 100 pages of paper copies shall be provided without charge.

(4)The FOIA Officer shall charge requesters who do not fall into any of the categories in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section fees which cover the full reasonable direct costs incurred for searching for and reproducing records if that total costs exceeds $15.00, except that the first 100 pages and the first two hours of manual search time shall not be charged. To apply this term to computer searches, the FOIA Officer shall determine the total hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's salary (plus 16 percent for benefits). When the cost of the search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, the FOIA Officer will begin assessing charges for the computer search.

(e)(1) Ordinarily, no charges will be assessed when requested records are not found or when records located are withheld as exempt. However, if the requester has been notified of the estimated cost of the search time and has been advised specifically that the requested records may not exist or may be withheld as exempt, fees may be charged.

(2) If the Commission fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits for responding to a request, it may not charge search fees or, in cases where records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)&#x2013;(iii) of this section.

(i) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the statutory time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

(ii) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, then the Commission may charge search fees and duplication fees, where applicable, if the following steps are taken. The FOIA Officer must:

(A) Provide timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and

(B) Discuss with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).

(iii) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, then a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

(f)The FOIA Officer may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill, accrued under previous FOIA request(s), starting the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent to you. A fee received by the FOIA Officer, even if not processed will result in a stay of the accrual of interest. The Commission shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, its implementing procedures, and the Commission's debt collection regulations located in 25 CFR part 513 to recover any indebtedness owed to the Commission.

(g)The requester or a group of requesters may not submit multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests to evade an assessment of fees, the FOIA Officer may aggregate such request and charge accordingly.

(h)Fees may be paid upon provision of the requested records, except that payment may be required prior to that time if the requester has previously failed to pay fees or if the FOIA Officer determines that total fee will exceed $250.00. When payment is required in advance of the processing of a request, the time limits prescribed in § 517.6 shall not be deemed to begin until the FOIA Officer has received payment of the assessed fee.

(i)Where it is anticipated that the cost of providing the requested record will exceed $25.00 after the free duplication and search time has been calculated, and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee greater than $25.00, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the requester of the amount of the anticipated fee or a portion thereof, which can readily be estimated. The notification shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with agency representatives for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a reduced cost.

#### PART 518 - SELF-REGULATION OF CLASS II GAMING

##### § 518.1 What does this part cover?

This part sets forth requirements for obtaining a certificate of self-regulation of Class II gaming operations under 25 U.S.C. 2710(c).

The Office of Self-Regulation shall be responsible for directing and coordinating the certification process. It shall provide a written report and recommendation to the Commission as to whether a certificate of self-regulation should be issued or denied, and a copy of the report and recommendation to the petitioning tribe.

##### § 518.7 What process will the Commission use to review and certify petitions?

(a) Petitions for self-regulation shall be submitted by tribes to the Office of Self-Regulation.

(1) Within 30 days of receipt of a tribe's petition, the Office of Self-Regulation shall conduct a review of the tribe's petition to determine whether it is complete under § 518.4.

(2) If the tribe's petition is incomplete, the Office of Self-Regulation shall notify the tribe by letter, certified mail or return receipt requested, of any obvious deficiencies or significant omissions in the petition. A tribe with an incomplete petition may submit additional information and/or clarification within 30 days of receipt of notice of an incomplete petition.

(3) If the tribe's petition is complete, the Office of Self-Regulation shall notify the tribe in writing.

(b) Once a tribe's petition is complete, the Office of Self-Regulation shall conduct a review to determine whether the tribe meets the eligibility criteria in § 518.3 and the approval criteria in § 518.5. During its review, the Office of Self-Regulation:

(iv) A list of any documents and other information received in support of the tribe's petition.

(5) A tribe shall have 30 days from the date of issuance of the report to submit to the Office of Self-Regulation a response to the report.

(d) After receiving the Office of Self-Regulation's recommendation and report, and a tribe's response to the report, the Commission shall issue preliminary findings as to whether the eligibility and approval criteria are met. The Commission's preliminary findings will be provided to the tribe within 45 days of receipt of the report.

(e) Upon receipt of the Commission's preliminary findings, the tribe can request, in writing, a hearing before the Commission, as set forth in § 518.8. Hearing requests shall be made to the Office of Self-Regulation, and shall specify the issues to be addressed by the tribe at the hearing and any proposed oral or written testimony the tribe wishes to present.

(f) The Commission shall issue a final determination within 30 days after issuance of its preliminary findings if the tribe has informed the Commission in writing that the tribe does not request a hearing or within 30 days after the conclusion of a hearing, if one is held. The decision of the Commission to approve or deny a petition shall be a final agency action.

##### § 518.14 May a tribe request a hearing on the Commission's proposal to revoke its certificate of self-regulation?

Such a request shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to part 584 of this chapter.

(A) At least one unannounced observation of each of the following: Gaming machine coin drop, gaming machine currency acceptor drop, table games drop, gaming machine coin count, gaming machine currency acceptor count, and table games count. The AICPA's “Audits of Casinos” Audit and Accounting Guide states that “observations of operations in the casino cage and count room should not be announced in advance * * *” For purposes of these procedures, “unannounced” means that no officers, directors, or employees are given advance information regarding the dates or times of such observations. The independent accountant should make arrangements with the gaming operation and Tribal gaming regulatory authority to ensure proper identification of the CPA's personnel and to provide for their prompt access to the count rooms.

() The gaming machine coin count observation would include a weigh scale test of all denominations using pre-counted coin. The count would be in process when these tests are performed, and would be conducted prior to the commencement of any other walk-through procedures. For computerized weigh scales, the test can be conducted at the conclusion of the count, but before the final totals are generated.

() The checklists should provide for drop/count observations, inclusive of hard drop/count, soft drop/count and currency acceptor drop/count. The count room would not be entered until the count is in process and the CPA would not leave the room until the monies have been counted and verified to the count sheet by the CPA and accepted into accountability. If the drop teams are unaware of the drop observations and the count observations would be unexpected, the hard count and soft count rooms may be entered simultaneously. Additionally, if the gaming machine currency acceptor count begins immediately after the table games count in the same location, by the same count team, and using the same equipment, the currency acceptor count observation can be conducted on the same day as the table games count observation, provided the CPA remains until monies are transferred to the vault/cashier.

(B) Observations of the gaming operation's employees as they perform their duties.

(C) Interviews with the gaming operation's employees who perform the relevant procedures.

(D) Compliance testing of various documents relevant to the procedures. The scope of such testing should be indicated on the checklist where applicable.

(E) For new gaming operations that have been in operation for three months or less at the end of their business year, performance of this regulation, section 542.3(f), is not required for the partial period.

() Alternatively, at the discretion of the Tribe, the Tribe may engage an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to perform the testing, observations and procedures reflected in paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section utilizing the Tribal internal control standards adopted by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or Tribally approved variance that has received Commission concurrence. Accordingly, the CPA will verify compliance by the gaming operation with the Tribal internal control standards. Should the Tribe elect this alternative, as a prerequisite, the CPA will perform the following:

(i) The CPA shall compare the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS to ascertain whether the criteria set forth in the MICS or Commission approved variances are adequately addressed.

(ii) The CPA may utilize personnel of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority to cross-reference the Tribal internal control standards to the MICS, provided the CPA performs a review of the Tribal gaming regulatory authority personnel's work and assumes complete responsibility for the proper completion of the work product.

(iii) The CPA shall report each procedure discovered by or brought to the CPA's attention that the CPA believes does not satisfy paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.

(3)(i) The CPA may rely on the work of an internal auditor, to the extent allowed by the professional standards, for the performance of the recommended procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, and for the completion of the checklists as they relate to the procedures covered therein provided that the internal audit department can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CPA that the requirements contained within § 542.22, 542.32, or 542.42, as applicable, have been satisfied.

(ii) Agreed-upon procedures are to be performed by the CPA to determine that the internal audit procedures performed for a past 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year has been properly completed. The CPA will apply the following Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's written assertion:

(A) Obtain internal audit department work-papers completed for a 12-month period (includes two 6-month periods) encompassing a portion or all of the most recent business year and determine whether the CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures were included in the internal audit work-papers and all steps described in the checklists were initialed or signed by an internal audit representative.

(B) For the internal audit work-papers obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, on a sample basis, reperform the procedures included in CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures prepared by internal audit and determine if all instances of noncompliance noted in the sample were documented as such by internal audit. The CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklists or other comparable testing procedures for the applicable Drop and Count procedures are not included in the sample reperformance of procedures because the CPA is required to perform the drop and count observations as required under paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(A) of this section of the Agreed-Upon Procedures. The CPA's sample should comprise a minimum of 3 percent of the procedures required in each CPA NIGC MICS Compliance Checklist or other comparable testing procedures for the gaming machine and table game departments and 5 percent for the other departments completed by internal audit in compliance with the internal audit MICS. The reperformance of procedures is performed as follows:

() For inquiries, the CPA should either speak with the same individual or an individual of the same job position as the internal auditor did for the procedure indicated in their checklist.

() For observations, the CPA should observe the same process as the internal auditor did for the procedure as indicated in their checklist.

() For document testing, the CPA should look at the same original document as tested by the internal auditor for the procedure as indicated in their checklist. The CPA need only retest the minimum sample size required in the checklist.

(C) The CPA is to investigate and resolve any differences between their reperformance results and the internal audit results.

(D) Documentation is maintained for 5 years by the CPA indicating the procedures reperformed along with the results.

(E) When performing the procedures for paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section in subsequent years, the CPA must select a different sample so that the CPA will reperform substantially all of the procedures after several years.

(F) Any additional procedures performed at the request of the Commission, the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or management should be included in the Agreed-Upon Procedures report transmitted to the Commission.

(4)(i) The NIGC has concluded that the performance of these procedures is an attestation engagement in which the CPA applies such Agreed-Upon Procedures to the gaming operation's assertion that it is in compliance with the MICS and, if applicable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Tribal internal control standards and approved variances, provide a level of control that equals or exceeds that of the MICS. Accordingly, the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE's), specifically SSAE 10, issued by the Auditing Standards Board is currently applicable. SSAE 10 provides current, pertinent guidance regarding agreed-upon procedure engagements, and the sample report formats included within those standards should be used, as appropriate, in the preparation of the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report. If future revisions are made to this standard or new SSAEs are adopted that are applicable to this type of engagement, the CPA is to comply with any revised professional standards in issuing their agreed upon procedures report. The Commission will provide an Example Report and Letter Formats upon request that may be used and contain all of the information discussed below:

(A) The report must describe all instances of procedural noncompliance regardless of materiality) with the MICS or approved variations, and all instances where the Tribal gaming regulatory authority's regulations do not comply with the MICS. When describing the agreed-upon procedures performed, the CPA should also indicate whether procedures performed by other individuals were utilized to substitute for the procedures required to be performed by the CPA. For each instance of noncompliance noted in the CPA's agreed-upon procedures report, the following information must be included:

() The citation of the applicable MICS for which the instance of noncompliance was noted.

() A narrative description of the noncompliance, including the number of exceptions and sample size tested.

(5)(i) The CPA shall prepare a report of the findings for the Tribe and management. The Tribe shall submit 2 copies of the report to the Commission no later than 120 days after the gaming operation's business year. This report should be provided in addition to any other reports required to be submitted to the Commission.

(ii) The CPA should maintain the work-papers supporting the report for a minimum of five years. Digital storage is acceptable. The Commission may request access to these work-papers, through the Tribe.

(6)In connection with the CPA testing pursuant to this section and as referenced therein, the Commission will provide CPA MICS Compliance Checklists upon request.

(g)(1) Each Tribal gaming regulatory authority is required to establish and implement internal control standards pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Each gaming operation is then required, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, to develop and implement an internal control system that complies with the Tribal internal control standards. Failure to do so may subject the Tribal operator of the gaming operation, and/or the management contractor, to penalties under 25 U.S.C. 2713.

(2) Recognizing that Tribes are the primary regulator of their gaming operation(s), enforcement action by the Commission will not be initiated under this part without first informing the Tribe and Tribal gaming regulatory authority of deficiencies in the internal controls of its gaming operation and allowing a reasonable period of time to address such deficiencies. Such prior notice and opportunity for corrective action is not required where the threat to the integrity of the gaming operation is immediate and severe.

##### § 542.4 How do these regulations affect minimum internal control standards established in a Tribal-State compact?

(a) If there is a direct conflict between an internal control standard established in a Tribal-State compact and a standard or requirement set forth in this part, then the internal control standard established in a Tribal-State compact shall prevail.

(b) If an internal control standard in a Tribal-State compact provides a level of control that equals or exceeds the level of control under an internal control standard or requirement set forth in this part, then the Tribal-State compact standard shall prevail.

(c) If an internal control standard or a requirement set forth in this part provides a level of control that exceeds the level of control under an internal control standard established in a Tribal-State compact, then the internal control standard or requirement set forth in this part shall prevail.

(i) A detailed description of the variance;

(ii) An explanation of how the variance achieves a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace; and

(iii) Evidence that the Tribal gaming regulatory authority has approved the variance.

(3) In the event that the Tribal gaming regulatory authority or the Tribe chooses to submit a variance request directly to the Chairman, it may do so without the approval requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and such request shall be deemed as having been approved by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority.

(b)(1) Following receipt of the variance approval, the Chairman or his or her designee shall have sixty (60) days to concur with or object to the approval of the variance.

(2) Any objection raised by the Chairman shall be in the form of a written explanation based upon the following criteria:

(i) There is no valid explanation of why the gaming operation should have received a variance approval from the Tribal gaming regulatory authority on the enumerated standard; or

(ii) The variance as approved by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority does not provide a level of control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.

(3) If the Chairman fails to object in writing within sixty (60) days after the date of receipt of a complete submission, the variance shall be considered concurred with by the Chairman.

(4) The 60-day deadline may be extended, provided such extension is mutually agreed upon by the Tribal gaming regulatory authority and the Chairman.

##### § 542.19 What are the minimum internal control standards for accounting?

(a) Each gaming operation shall prepare accurate, complete, legible, and permanent records of all transactions pertaining to revenue and gaming activities.

(b) Each gaming operation shall prepare general accounting records according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles on a double-entry system of accounting, maintaining detailed, supporting, subsidiary records, including, but not limited to:

(1) Detailed records identifying revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity for each gaming operation;

(2) Detailed records of all markers, IOU's, returned checks, hold checks, or other similar credit instruments;

(3) Individual and statistical game records to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop by each table game, and to reflect statistical drop, statistical win, and the percentage of statistical win to statistical drop for each type of table game, by shift, by day, cumulative month-to-date and year-to-date, and individual and statistical game records reflecting similar information for all other games;

(4) Gaming machine analysis reports which, by each machine, compare actual hold percentages to theoretical hold percentages;

(5) The records required by this part and by the Tribal internal control standards;

(6) Journal entries prepared by the gaming operation and by its independent accountants; and

(7) Any other records specifically required to be maintained.

(c) Each gaming operation shall establish administrative and accounting procedures for the purpose of determining effective control over a gaming operation's fiscal affairs. The procedures shall be designed to reasonably ensure that:

(1) Assets are safeguarded;

(2) Financial records are accurate and reliable;

(3) Transactions are performed only in accordance with management's general and specific authorization;

(4) Transactions are recorded adequately to permit proper reporting of gaming revenue and of fees and taxes, and to maintain accountability of assets;

(5) Recorded accountability for assets is compared with actual assets at reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is taken with respect to any discrepancies; and

(6) Functions, duties, and responsibilities are appropriately segregated in accordance with sound business practices.

(d)(1) For table games, gross revenue equals the closing table bankroll, plus credit slips for cash, chips, tokens or personal/payroll checks returned to the cage, plus drop, less opening table bankroll and fills to the table, and money transfers issued from the game through the use of a cashless wagering system.

(2) For gaming machines, gross revenue equals drop, less fills, jackpot payouts and personal property awarded to patrons as gambling winnings. Additionally, the initial hopper load is not a fill and does not affect gross revenue. The difference between the initial hopper load and the total amount that is in the hopper at the end of the gaming operation's fiscal year should be adjusted accordingly as an addition to or subtraction from the drop for the year.

(3) For each counter game, gross revenue equals:

(i) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month or will occur in subsequent months, less money paid out during the month to patrons on winning wagers (“cash basis”); or

(ii) The money accepted by the gaming operation on events or games that occur during the month, plus money, not previously included in gross revenue, that was accepted by the gaming operation in previous months on events or games occurring in the month, less money paid out during the month to patrons as winning wagers (“modified accrual basis”).

(4) For each card game and any other game in which the gaming operation is not a party to a wager, gross revenue equals all money received by the operation as compensation for conducting the game.

(i) A gaming operation shall not include either shill win or loss in gross revenue computations.

(ii) In computing gross revenue for gaming machines, keno and bingo, the actual cost to the gaming operation of any personal property distributed as losses to patrons may be deducted from winnings (other than costs of travel, lodging, services, food, and beverages), if the gaming operation maintains detailed documents supporting the deduction.

(e) Each gaming operation shall establish internal control systems sufficient to ensure that currency (other than tips or gratuities) received from a patron in the gaming area is promptly placed in a locked box in the table, or, in the case of a cashier, in the appropriate place in the cashier's cage, or on those games which do not have a locked drop box, or on card game tables, in an appropriate place on the table, in the cash register or in another approved repository.

(f) If the gaming operation provides periodic payments to satisfy a payout resulting from a wager, the initial installment payment, when paid, and the actual cost of a payment plan, which is funded by the gaming operation, may be deducted from winnings. The gaming operation is required to obtain the approval of all payment plans from the TGRA. For any funding method which merely guarantees the gaming operation's performance, and under which the gaming operation makes payments out of cash flow (e.g. irrevocable letters of credits, surety bonds, or other similar methods), the gaming operation may only deduct such payments when paid to the patron.

(g) For payouts by wide-area progressive gaming machine systems, a gaming operation may deduct from winnings only its pro rata share of a wide-area gaming machine system payout.

(h) Cash-out tickets issued at a gaming machine or gaming device shall be deducted from gross revenue as jackpot payouts in the month the tickets are issued by the gaming machine or gaming device. Tickets deducted from gross revenue that are not redeemed within a period, not to exceed 180 days of issuance, shall be included in gross revenue. An unredeemed ticket previously included in gross revenue may be deducted from gross revenue in the month redeemed.

(i) A gaming operation may not deduct from gross revenues the unpaid balance of a credit instrument extended for purposes other than gaming.

(1) The gaming operation can document that the credit extended was for gaming purposes;

(2) The gaming operation has established procedures and relevant criteria to evaluate a patron's credit reputation or financial resources and to then determine that there is a reasonable basis for extending credit in the amount or sum placed at the patron's disposal;

(3) In the case of personal checks, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, which would normally be acceptable as a type of identification when cashing checks, and has recorded the patron's bank check guarantee card number or credit card number, or has satisfied paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;

(4) In the case of third-party checks for which cash, chips, or tokens have been issued to the patron, or which were accepted in payment of another credit instrument, the gaming operation has established procedures to examine documentation, normally accepted as a means of identification when cashing checks, and has, for the check's maker or drawer, satisfied paragraph (j)(2) of this section, as management may deem appropriate for the check-cashing authorization granted;

(5) In the case of guaranteed drafts, procedures should be established to ensure compliance with the issuance and acceptance procedures prescribed by the issuer;

(6) The gaming operation has established procedures to ensure that the credit extended is appropriately documented, not least of which would be the patron's identification and signature attesting to the authenticity of the individual credit transactions. The authorizing signature shall be obtained at the time credit is extended.

Such documentation would include, but not be limited to, letters sent to the patron, logs of personal or telephone conversations, proof of presentation of the credit instrument to the patron's bank for collection, settlement agreements, or other documents which demonstrate that the gaming operation has made a good faith attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. Such records documenting collection efforts shall be made available to the TGRA or the commission upon request.

(k) Maintenance and preservation of books, records and documents. (1) All original books, records and documents pertaining to the conduct of wagering activities shall be retained by a gaming operation in accordance with the following schedule. A record that summarizes gaming transactions is sufficient, provided that all documents containing an original signature(s) attesting to the accuracy of a gaming related transaction are independently preserved. Original books, records or documents shall not include copies of originals, except for copies that contain original comments or notations on parts of multi-part forms. The following original books, records and documents shall be retained by a gaming operation for a minimum of five (5) years:

(i) Casino cage documents;

(ii) Documentation supporting the calculation of table game win;

(iii) Documentation supporting the calculation of gaming machine win;

(b)Downloaded software on a Class II gaming system must be capable of being verified by the Class II gaming system using a software signature verification method that meets the requirements of § 547.8(f).

##### § 547.13 What are the minimum technical standards for program storage media?

(a)All removable program storage media must maintain an internal checksum or signature of its contents. Verification of this checksum or signature is to be performed after every restart. If the verification fails, the affected Class II gaming system component(s) must lock up and enter a fault state.

(b)(1) All EPROMs and Programmable Logic Devices that have erasure windows must be fitted with covers over their erasure windows.

(2) All unused areas of EPROMs must be written with the inverse of the erased state (zero bits (00 hex) for most EPROMs), random data, or repeats of the program data.

(3) Flash memory storage components intended to have the same logical function as ROM, must be write-protected or otherwise protected from unauthorized modification.

(4) The write cycle must be closed or finished for all CD&#x2013;ROMs such that it is not possible to write any further data to the CD.

(5) Write protected hard disks are permitted if the hardware means of enabling the write protect is easily viewable and can be sealed in place. Write protected hard disks are permitted using software write protection verifiable by a testing laboratory.

(c)(1) Writable and rewritable program storage, such as hard disk drives, Flash memory, writable CD&#x2013;ROMs, and writable DVDs, may be used provided that the software stored thereon may be verified using the mechanism provided pursuant to § 547.8(f).

(a)All RNGs must produce output having the following properties:

(1) Statistical randomness;

(2) Unpredictability; and

(3) Non-repeatability.

(b)(1) Numbers or other designations produced by an RNG must be statistically random individually and in the permutations and combinations used in the application under the rules of the game. For example, if a bingo game with 75 objects with numbers or other designations has a progressive winning pattern of the five numbers or other designations on the bottom of the card, and the winning of this prize is defined to be the five numbers or other designations that are matched in the first five objects drawn, the likelihood of each of the 75C5 combinations are to be verified to be statistically equal.

(2) Numbers or other designations produced by an RNG must pass the statistical tests for randomness to a 99% confidence level, which may include:

(i) Chi-square test;

(ii) Runs test (patterns of occurrences must not be recurrent); and

(iii) Serial correlation test potency and degree of serial correlation (outcomes must be independent from the previous game).

(iv) Equi-distribution (frequency) test;

(v) Gap test;

(vi) Poker test;

(vii) Coupon collector's test;

(viii) Permutation test;

(ix) Spectral test; or

(x) Test on subsequences.

(c)(1) It must not be feasible to predict future outputs of an RNG, even if the algorithm and the past sequence of outputs are known.

(2) Unpredictability must be ensured by reseeding or by continuously cycling the RNG, and by providing a sufficient number of RNG states for the applications supported.

(3) Re-seeding may be used where the re-seeding input is at least as statistically random as, and independent of, the output of the RNG being re-seeded.

(d)The RNG may not be initialized to reproduce the same output stream that it has produced before, nor may any two instances of an RNG produce the same stream as each other. This property must be ensured by initial seeding that comes from:

(1) A source of “true” randomness, such as a hardware random noise generator; or

(2) A combination of timestamps, parameters unique to a Class II gaming system, previous RNG outputs, or other, similar method.

(e)(1) Software that calls an RNG to derive game outcome events must immediately use the output returned in accordance with the game rules.

(2) The use of multiple RNGs is permitted as long as they operate in accordance with this section.

(3) RNG outputs must not be arbitrarily discarded or selected.

(4) Where a sequence of outputs is required, the whole of the sequence in the order generated must be used in accordance with the game rules.

(5) The Class II gaming system must neither adjust the RNG process or game outcomes based on the history of prizes obtained in previous games nor use any reflexive software or secondary decision that affects the results shown to the player or game outcome.

(f)An RNG that provides output scaled to given ranges must:

(1) Be independent and uniform over the range;

(2) Provide numbers scaled to the ranges required by game rules, and notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, may discard numbers that do not map uniformly onto the required range but must use the first number in sequence that does map correctly to the range;

(3) Be capable of producing every possible outcome of a game according to its rules; and

(4) Use an unbiased algorithm. A scaling algorithm is considered to be unbiased if the measured bias is no greater than 1 in 50 million.

##### § 547.15 What are the minimum technical standards for electronic data communications between system components?

(a)Communication of sensitive data must be secure from eavesdropping, access, tampering, intrusion or alteration unauthorized by the TGRA. Sensitive data includes, but is not limited to:

(1) RNG seeds and outcomes;

(2) Encryption keys, where the implementation chosen requires transmission of keys;

(3) PINs;

(4) Passwords;

(5) Financial instrument transactions;

(6) Transfers of funds;

(7) Player tracking information;

(8) Download Packages; and

(9) Any information that affects game outcome.

(b)(1) Wireless access points must not be accessible to the general public.

(2) Open or unsecured wireless communications are prohibited.

(3) Wireless communications must be secured using a methodology that makes eavesdropping, access, tampering, intrusion or alteration impractical. By way of illustration, such methodologies include encryption, frequency hopping, and code division multiplex access (as in cell phone technology).

(c) Methodologies must be used that will ensure the reliable transfer of data and provide a reasonable ability to detect and act upon any corruption of the data.

(d) Class II gaming systems must record detectable, unauthorized access or intrusion attempts.

(e) Remote communications may only be allowed if authorized by the TGRA. Class II gaming systems must have the ability to enable or disable remote access, and the default state must be set to disabled.

(f) Failure of data communications must not affect the integrity of critical memory.

(g) The Class II gaming system must log the establishment, loss, and re-establishment of data communications between sensitive Class II gaming system components.

##### § 547.16 What are the minimum standards for game artwork, glass, and rules?

(a)The following must at all times be displayed or made readily available to the player upon request:

(1) Game name, rules, and options such as the purchase or wager amount stated clearly and unambiguously;

(2) Denomination;

(3) Instructions for play on, and use of, the player interface, including the functions of all buttons; and

(4) A prize schedule or other explanation, sufficient to allow a player to determine the correctness of all prizes awarded, including:

(i) The range and values obtainable for any variable prize;

(ii) Whether the value of a prize depends on the purchase or wager amount; and

(iii) The means of division of any pari-mutuel prizes; but

(iv) For Class II Gaming Systems, the prize schedule or other explanation need not state that subsets of winning patterns are not awarded as additional prizes (for example, five in a row does not also pay three in a row or four in a row), unless there are exceptions, which must be clearly stated.

(b)The Player Interface must continually display:

(1) “Malfunctions void all prizes and plays” or equivalent; and

(2) “Actual Prizes Determined by Bingo (or other applicable Class II game) Play. Other Displays for Entertainment Only” or equivalent.

(c)If the odds of winning any advertised top prize exceeds 100 million to one, the Player Interface must display: “Odds of winning the advertised top prize exceeds 100 million to one” or equivalent.

##### § 547.17 How does a TGRA apply to implement an alternate minimum standard to those required by this part?

(a)(1) A TGRA may approve an alternate standard from those required by this part if it has determined that the alternate standard will achieve a level of security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace. A gaming operation may implement an alternate standard upon TGRA approval subject to the Chair's decision pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) For each enumerated standard for which the TGRA approves an alternate standard, it must submit to the Chair within 30 days a detailed report, which must include the following:

(i) An explanation of how the alternate standard achieves a level of security and integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace; and

(ii) The alternate standard as approved and the record on which the approval is based.

(3) In the event that the TGRA or the tribe's government chooses to submit an alternate standard request directly to the Chair for joint government to government review, the TGRA or tribal government may do so without the approval requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b)(1) The Chair may approve or object to an alternate standard approved by a TGRA.

(2) If the Chair approves the alternate standard, the Tribe may continue to use it as authorized by the TGRA.

(3) If the Chair objects to the alternate standard, the operation may no longer use the alternate standard and must follow the relevant technical standard set forth in this part.

(4) Any objection by the Chair must be in written form with an explanation why the alternate standard as approved by the TGRA does not provide a level of security or integrity sufficient to accomplish the purpose of the standard it is to replace.

(5) If the Chair fails to approve or object in writing within 60 days after the date of receipt of a complete submission, the alternate standard is considered approved by the Chair. The Chair may, upon notification to the TGRA, extend this deadline an additional 60 days.

(c)A TGRA may appeal the Chair's decision pursuant to 25 CFR chapter III, subchapter H.

#### PART 572 [RESERVED]

#### PART 573 - COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

##### § 573.1 What is the purpose of this part?

Voluntary compliance is the goal of the Commission. Voluntary compliance is achieved when a tribe and the NIGC staff are able to resolve any potential enforcement issues prior to the Chair issuing an enforcement action. This part sets forth efforts for achieving voluntary compliance and enforcement action when voluntary compliance is not forthcoming. While this part is intended to garner voluntary compliance through a graduated enforcement process, there may be circumstances under which a graduated enforcement process is omitted and an enforcement action must be taken. This part also sets forth general rules governing the Commission's enforcement of the Act, this chapter, and tribal ordinances and resolutions approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. Civil fines in connection with notices of violation issued under this part are addressed in part 575 of this chapter.

##### § 573.2 When may a letter of concern be issued?

(a) Prior to the Chair taking an enforcement action, a letter of concern may be provided by NIGC staff, detailing concerns regarding compliance with the Act, this chapter, or any tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter. A letter of concern describes the available facts and information, includes a preliminary assessment regarding the incident or condition, and indicates that it may be a violation.

(b) Action under this section does not constitute agency action.

(c) A letter of concern issued under paragraph (a) of this section must provide a time period for the respondent to respond. If the letter of concern is resolved without enforcement action, NIGC staff may send an investigation completion letter pursuant to § 571.4 of this chapter.

(d) The Chair's discretion to take an enforcement action is not limited or constrained in any way by this section. When the Chair takes enforcement action before a letter of concern is issued, the enforcement action must state the reasons for moving directly to an enforcement action without first issuing a letter of concern.

##### § 573.3 Notice of violation.

(a) The Chair may issue a notice of violation to any person for violations of any provision of the Act or this chapter, or of any tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter.

(a)Simultaneously with or subsequently to the issuance of a notice of violation under § 573.3, the Chair may issue an order of temporary closure of all or part of an Indian gaming operation if one or more of the following substantial violations are present:

(1) The respondent fails to correct violations within:

(i) The time permitted in a notice of violation; or

(ii) A reasonable time after a tribe is served with notice of a violation.

(2) A gaming operation fails to pay the annual fee required by 25 CFR part 514.

(3) A gaming operation operates for business without a tribal ordinance or resolution that the Chair has approved under part 522 of this chapter.

(4) A gaming operation operates for business without a license from a tribe, in violation of part 522 or part 559 of this chapter.

(5) A gaming operation operates for business without either background investigations completed for, or tribal licenses granted to, all key employees and primary management officials, as provided in § 558.3(b) of this chapter.

(6) There is clear and convincing evidence that a gaming operation defrauds a tribe.

(7) A management contractor operates for business without a contract that the Chair has approved under part 533 of this chapter.

(8) Any person knowingly submits false or misleading information to the Commission or a tribe in response to any provision of the Act, this chapter, or a tribal ordinance or resolution that the Chair has approved under part 522 of this chapter.

(9) A gaming operation refuses to allow an authorized representative of the Commission or an authorized tribal official to enter or inspect a gaming operation, in violation of § 571.5 or § 571.6 of this chapter, or of a tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter.

(10) A tribe fails to suspend a license upon notification by the Commission that a primary management official or key employee does not meet the standards for employment contained in § 556.5 of this chapter, in violation of § 558.4 of this chapter.

(11) A gaming operation operates class III games in the absence of a tribal-state compact that is in effect, in violation of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d).

(12) A gaming operation's facility is constructed, maintained, or operated in a manner that threatens the environment or the public health and safety, in violation of a tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chair under part 522 of this chapter.

(13) A gaming facility operates on Indian lands not eligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

(b)The operator of an Indian gaming operation shall close the operation upon service of an order of temporary closure, unless the order provides otherwise.

(c)Within seven (7) days after service of an order of temporary closure, the respondent may request, orally or in writing, informal expedited review by the Chair.

(1) The Chair shall complete the expedited review provided for by this paragraph within two (2) days after his or her receipt of a timely request.

(2) The Chair shall, within two (2) days after the expedited review provided for by this paragraph:

(i) Decide whether to continue an order of temporary closure; and

(ii) Provide the respondent with an explanation of the basis for the decision.

(3) Whether or not a respondent seeks informal expedited review under this paragraph, within thirty (30) days after the Chair serves an order of temporary closure the respondent may appeal the order to the Commission under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter. Otherwise, the order shall remain in effect unless rescinded by the Chair for good cause.

##### § 573.5 When does an enforcement action become final agency action?

An enforcement action shall become final agency action and a final order of the Commission when:

(a) A respondent fails to appeal the enforcement action as provided for in subchapter H of this chapter and does not enter into a settlement agreement resolving the matter in its entirety; or

(b) A respondent enters into a settlement agreement resolving the matter in its entirety at any time after the issuance of the enforcement action.

This part addresses the assessment of civil fines under section 2713(a) of the Act with respect to notices of violation issued under § 573.3 of this chapter.

##### § 575.3 How assessments are made.

The Chairman shall review each notice of violation and order of temporary closure in accordance with § 575.4 of this part to determine whether a civil fine will be assessed, the amount of the fine, and, in the case of continuing violations, whether each daily illegal act or omission will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of the total civil fine assessed.

##### § 575.4 When civil fine will be assessed.

The Chairman may assess a civil fine, not to exceed $57,527 per violation, against a tribe, management contractor, or individual operating Indian gaming for each notice of violation issued under § 573.3 of this chapter after considering the following factors:

(a)The Chairman shall consider the extent to which the respondent obtained an economic benefit from the noncompliance that gave rise to a notice of violation, as well as the likelihood of escaping detection.

(1) The Chairman may consider the documented benefits derived from the noncompliance, or may rely on reasonable assumptions regarding such benefits.

(2) If noncompliance continues for more than one day, the Chairman may treat each daily illegal act or omission as a separate violation.

(b)The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine to reflect the seriousness of the violation. In doing so, the Chairman shall consider the extent to which the violation threatens the integrity of Indian gaming.

(c)The Chairman may adjust a civil fine by an amount that reflects the respondent's history of violations over the preceding five (5) years.

(1) A violation cited by the Chairman shall not be considered unless the associated notice of violation is the subject of a final order of the Commission and has not been vacated; and

(2) Each violation shall be considered whether or not it led to a civil fine.

(d)The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of fault of the respondent in causing or failing to correct the violation, either through act or omission.

(e)The Chairman may reduce the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of good faith of the respondent in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.

##### § 575.5 Procedures for assessment of civil fines.

(a) Within 15 days after service of a notice of violation, or such longer period as the Chairman may grant for good cause, the respondent may submit written information about the violation to the Chairman. The Chairman shall consider any information so submitted in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the civil fine.

(b) The Chairman shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment on the respondent within thirty (30) days after the notice of violation was issued, when practicable.

(c) The Chairman may review and reassess any civil fine if necessary to consider facts that were not reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment.

##### § 575.6 Settlement, reduction, or waiver of civil fine.

(a)(1) Upon written request of a respondent received at any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the Chairman may reduce or waive a civil fine if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in a particular case, the fine is demonstrably unjust.

(2) All petitions for reduction or waiver shall contain:

(i) A detailed description of the violation that is the subject of the fine;

(ii) A detailed recitation of the facts that support a finding that the fine is demonstrably unjust, accompanied by underlying documentation, if any; and

(iii) A declaration, signed and dated by the respondent and his or her counsel or representative, if any, as follows: Under penalty of perjury, I declare that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the representations made in this petition are true and correct.

(3) The Chairman shall serve the respondent with written notice of his or her determination under paragraph (a) of this section, including a statement of the grounds for the Chairman's decision.

(b)At any time prior to the filing of a notice of appeal under part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the Chairman and the respondent may agree to settle an enforcement action, including the amount of the associated civil fine. In the event a settlement is reached, a settlement agreement shall be prepared and executed by the Chairman and the respondent. If a settlement agreement is executed, the respondent shall be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the violation or civil fine in question, except as otherwise provided expressly in the settlement agreement. In the absence of a settlement of the issues under this paragraph, the respondent may contest the assessed civil fine before the Commission in accordance with part 584 or part 585 of this chapter.

##### § 575.7 Final assessment.

(a) If the respondent fails to request a hearing as provided in part 584 or part 585 of this chapter, the proposed civil fine assessment shall become a final order of the Commission.

##### § 700.15 Waiver of rights by owner.

Nothing in these regulations shall prevent a fully informed applicant from voluntarily waiving any of his/her rights under the regulations in this part. A waiver of rights shall in no way constitute an exemption from the requirement to relocate pursuant to the Act.

#### Subpart B - Acquisition and Disposal of Habitations and/or Improvements

##### § 700.111 Applicability of acquisition requirements.

The requirements of this subpart B apply to all Commission acquisition of habitations and/or improvements that occur on or after the effective date of these regulations.

##### § 700.113 Basic acquisition policies.

(a)Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall have the habitations and/or improvements appraised to its satisfaction and will attempt to assure that the owner or his designated representative is contacted in advance of the appraisal(s) and given an opportunity to accompany each appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.

(b)Before the initiation of negotiations, the Commission shall establish an amount which it believes is fair market value for improvements. This amount shall be based on a current appraisal at the time negotations commence for the Relocation Contract between the NHIRC and the relocatee. The appraisal will be adjusted according to the Boeckh Building Cost Modifier for time or any physical changes in the improvements. If any changes are necessary the appraisal will be corrected to reflect a current dollar value. The amount of the current appraisal will be offered as just compensation for the improvements acquired, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A copy of the initial appraisal will be sent to the owner as soon as possible after the appraisal program is completed.

(c)The Commission will attempt to meet with the owner or his/her representative to discuss its offer to purchase his/her property including the basis for the determination of fair market value and explain acquisition policies and procedures, including payment of incidental expenses. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to present material which he/she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Commission shall consider the owner's presentation.

(d) If the condition of the property indicates the need for a new appraisal or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the latest appraisal of the property, the Commission shall have the appraisal updated or obtain a new appraisal. If a new appraisal is for a lesser value than the previous appraisal and said lesser value is due to damage done to the property during the time between the two appraisals, and such damage was not caused by the owner of the improvement, the owner shall be entitled to the higher appraisal value.

(e) [Reserved]

(f)If the owner objects to the Commission's determination of fair market value, the owner may request a hearing pursuant to the Commission's Hearing and Administrative Review procedures;

(g)Before requiring an owner to surrender possession of his habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall&#x2014;

(1) Apply the agreed purchase price towards the acquisition price of the replacement dwelling or;

(2) Deposit with the court in an appropriate proceeding, such as divorce or probate, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the Commission's determination of fair market value for the property or the court award of compensation for the property up to the maximum benefit allowed under the then existing replacement housing benefit.

##### § 700.115 Preliminary acquisition notice.

As soon as feasible in the acquisition process, the Commission shall issue a preliminary acquisition notice to the owner. The notice shall&#x2014;

(a) Inform the owner of the Commission's interest in acquiring his/her habitations and/or improvements.

(b) Explain that such preliminary acquisition notice is not a notice to vacate and that it does not establish eligibility for relocation payments or other relocation assistance under these regulations.

##### § 700.117 Criteria for appraisals.

(a)The Commission's appraisals shall be based upon nationally recognized appraisal standards and techniques to the extent that such principles are consistent with the concepts of value that the Commission may establish.

(b)Appraisal reports must contain sufficient documentation, including supporting valuation data and the appraiser's analyses of that data, to demonstrate the reasonableness of the appraiser's opinion(s) of value.

(c)No appraiser shall have any interest, direct or indirect, in the habitations and/or improvements which he appraisers for the Commission that would in any way conflict with his performance of the appraisal.

##### § 700.119 Establishment of fair market value.

(a)The Commission shall establish the amount of fair market value to be offered to the owner for the habitations and/or improvements. Such amount shall not be less than&#x2014;

(1) The appraiser's recommendations as to the fair market value of the habitations and/or improvements; or

(2) The fair market value estimate set forth in the agency's approved appraisal, if the property is valued at $2,000 or less.

(b)If the owner of a habitation and/or improvement is permitted to retain it for removal off-site, the amount determined to be just compensation for the interest in habitations and/or improvements to be acquired from him shall not be less than the amount determined by subtracting the salvage value of the improvements he retains for off-site removal from the amount determined to be fair market value for his entire interest in the habitation and improvement. Retention of improvements by the owner shall not change, alter or abrogate the requirement of the Act that the owner must move from land partitioned to the tribe of which he/she is not a member.

##### § 700.121 Statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value.

At the time of the initiation of negotiations to acquire the habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall furnish the owner, along with the initial written purchase offer, a written statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value. To the extent permitted by the Commission, the statement shall include the following&#x2014;

(a) A description and location identification of the habitations and/or improvements to be acquired.

(b) An inventory identifying the buildings, structures, fixtures, and other improvements, including appurtenant removable building equipment, which are considered to be part of the habitations and/or improvements for which the offer of fair market value is made.

(c) A recital of the amount of the offer and a declaration that such amount&#x2014;

(1) Is the full amount believed by the Commission to be just compensation for the property and is not less than the fair market value of the property as determined on the basis of the appraisal(s);

(2) Does not reflect any relocation payments or other relocation assistance which the owner is entitled to receive.

(d) If only a portion of a habitation and/or improvement is to be acquired, an apportionment of the total estimated just compensation for the partial acquisition will be made. In the event that the Commission determines that partial acquisitions are necessary, all portions so acquired will be acquired simultaneously.

##### § 700.123 Expenses incidental to transfer of ownership to the Commission.

The Commission shall reimburse the owner for reasonable expenses he/she necessarily incurred incidental to the transfer of habitations and/or improvements to the Commission. The Commission is not required to pay costs solely required to perfect the owner's interest in the habitations and/or improvements.

##### § 700.125 Disposal of property.

Property acquired by the Commission pursuant to the Act shall be disposed of in one of the following manners:

(a) If the Commission determines that the property acquired constitutes a substantial risk to public health and safety, the Commission may remove or destroy the property.

(b) The Commission may transfer the property acquired by gratuitous conveyance to the tribe exercising jurisdiction over the area. Notice of such transfer shall be in writing and shall be completed within sixty (60) days from the finalization of all property acquisition procedures, unless the tribe notifies the Commission in writing within that time that the property transfer is refused. In the event of a refusal by the tribe, the Commission shall remove the property.

##### § 700.127 Payments for acquisition of improvements.

Payments for acquisition of improvements shall be made in the following situations:

(a) To individuals who have been denied benefits under these rules and who can prove ownership of habitations and improvements on land partitioned to the tribe of which they are not members. If the owner is deceased the payment shall be made to his or her estate. Payments under this subsection are further limited by 25 U.S.C. 640d&#x2013;14(c), Pub. L. 93&#x2013;531, sec. 15(c).

(b) To individuals who have been certified as eligible for relocation benefits but who at the time of certification, own a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling as determined by the Commission pursuant to § 700.187 and who own habitation and improvements on land partitioned to the tribe of which they are not members.

If the Commission determines that a person occupying habitations and/or improvements adjacent to the habitations and/or improvements acquired pursuant to the Act is caused substantial social, economic cultural or other injury because of such acquisition, it may offer such services to such person.

(b)The advisory program will include such measures, facilities, and services as may be necessary or appropriate in order to&#x2014;

(a) In order to be considered for voluntary relocation assistance benefits, an applicant must have filed a completed application form with the Commission by the close of business on July 7, 1986.

(b) To qualify for relocation assistance, individuals must meet the eligibility requirements as of July 7, 1986.

##### § 700.138 Persons who have not applied for voluntary relocation by July 7, 1986.

To be eligible for benefits (Housing and Moving Expenses), such persons must be, as of July 7, 1986, physically residing full time on land partitioned to a tribe of which they are not members and they must also otherwise meet all other current eligibility criteria.

(b) The Commission shall utilize amounts payable with respect to such households pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 640d&#x2013;14(b)(2) and 25 U.S.C. 640d&#x2013;34(a) for the construction or acquisition of a home and related facilities for such households.

(c) Persons identified by the Commission as potentially subject to relocation who have not applied for relocation assistance shall be contacted by the Commission as soon as practicable after July 7, 1986. At such time, the Commission shall&#x2014;

##### § 700.139 Referral for action.

Upon the expiration of all notice periods and upon the failure or refusal of any relocatees to make timely arrangements to move, the Commission shall forward the names and addresses of such relocatees to the Secretary of the Interior and to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona for such action as they deem appropriate. The Commission will assure the availability of relocation assistance to which the relocatees may be entitled.

##### § 700.141 General requirements - claims for relocation payments.

(c)Relocation payments shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Relocation Contracts and are not subject to claims of creditors or assignments.

##### § 700.143 Payments for divorced or separated relocatees.

The following considerations apply to certified eligible heads of household who are legally separated or divorced and intend to establish separate eligibility.

(a) Determination of benefits. Eligibility for relocation benefits is determined as of the time that the Relocation Contract is signed.

(1) If the divorce or separation took place before benefits were first applied for, the spouse who vacated the habitation will not be eligible for benefits and all relocation benefits will accrue to the spouse remaining in occupancy as head of the household remaining to be relocated.

(2) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time that benefits are first applied for, and are divorced or separated prior to signing of a Relocation Contract, both husband and wife may qualify separately for benefits if each meets the requirements of eligibility under these regulations.

(3) If both husband and wife are in possession of the habitation at the time a Relocation Contract is signed but are divorced or separated prior to occupancy of the replacement dwelling, only one benefit will be paid to the household. Such benefits (including the assistance payment, moving expenses and replacement dwelling benefit) and the purchase price of the habitation and improvements may be prorated between husband and wife in such manner as they may agree in writing so long as such proration is consistent with the terms of the Relocation Contract. Such proration may also be made by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the absence of an agreement between the parties or a court order, any necessary prorations shall be made by the Commission.

(b) For purposes of this section, a head of household shall be considered as married even though living apart from his or her spouse unless legally separated under a decree or separate maintenance.

##### § 700.145 Payments to estates.

(a) Relocation benefits can be paid to the estate of a deceased Certified Eligible Head of Household under the following circumstances:

(1) If there is no household requiring relocation pursuant to the Act surviving the deceased head of household:

(i) Compensation for the habitation and other improvements owned by the deceased head of household and the cost of removing personal property from the acquired habitation and other improvements shall be paid to the estate of a deceased head of household, or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii) No replacement housing benefit or assistance payment (bonus) shall be paid under this circumstance.

(2) Replacement housing benefits may be paid to an estate only when a certified eligible head of household was qualified for such a housing payment pursuant to the Act and signed a Relocation Contract but died before the replacement housing was occupied. The estate of a certified eligible head of household who had not signed a Relocation Contract at the time of his/her death is not eligible for payment of a replacement housing benefit.

(b) If one of a married couple who was a certified eligible head of household dies, the surviving spouse may be paid the same relocation assistance benefits, including replacement housing payments, which the couple would have received had death not occurred. If there is no surviving spouse, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a guardian to act for minor members of the household. The Commission shall deal with such guardian and any members of the household who have attained their majority in a manner to effect relocation of the remaining household under these regulations.

##### § 700.147 Eligibility.

(a) To be eligible for services provided for under the Act, and these regulations, the head of household and/or immediate family must have been residents on December 22, 1974, of an area partitioned to the Tribe of which they were not members.

(b) The burden of proving residence and head of household status is on the applicant.

(c) Eligibility for benefits is further restricted by 25 U.S.C. 640d&#x2013;13(c) and 14(c).

(d) Individuals are not entitled to receive separate benefits if it is determined that they are members of a household which has received benefits.

(e) Relocation benefits are restricted to those who qualify as heads-of-household as of July 7, 1986.

(b)The amount of payment for an eligible expense under this subpart shall not exceed the least costly method, as determined by the Commission, of accomplishing the objective of the payment without causing undue hardship to the certified eligible heads of household.

(c)Written approval of the Commission must be obtained for all moving and search expenses in this subpart. Such approval shall be obtained by each certified eligible head of household prior to incurring any expense from the real estate specialist to whom the case is assigned.

(b) A dislocation allowance of $200 (two hundred dollars).

##### § 700.171 Fixed payment for moving expenses - nonresidential moves.

(a)The fixed payment for moving and related expenses of a displaced business or farm operation that meets applicable requirements under this section is an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with § 700.173, but not less than $2,500 nor more than $10,000. A nonprofit organization which meets the applicable requirements under this section is entitled to a payment of $2,500.

(1) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage.

(2) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having another establishment, which is not being acquired by the Commission, and which is under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities.

(1) The part acquired was a farm operation before the acquisition; or

(2) The partial acquisition caused the operator to be displaced from the farm operation; or

(3) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.

(e)A nonprofit organization qualifies for a $2,500 payment under this section, if the Commission determines that it&#x2014;

##### § 700.173 Average net earnings of business or farm.

(a)For purposes of this subpart, the average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation is one-half of its net earnings before Federal, State and local income taxes, during the two taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. However, if the business or farm was not in operation for the full two taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be computed on the basis of the actual period of operation on the acquired site, projected to an annual rate. Also, average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Commission determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, his spouse, or dependents.

(b)A displaced person who elects to receive a fixed payment in lieu of actual expenses incurred in moving his business or farm shall furnish the Commission proof of his net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements or other reasonable evidence.

(1) The move will be undertaken because:

(i) It is necessary because of an emergency as determined by the Commission; or

(ii) The individual or family is subject to conditions hazardous to his or his family's health or safety.

(2) The temporary housing is decent, safe, and sanitary.

(3) The Commission shall have determined that within twelve (12) months of the date of the temporary move, replacement housing meeting Commission-approved standards will be available for occupancy by the persons temporarily rehoused.

(4) Prior to the move, the Commission shall provide in writing assurance to each head of household that:

(i) Replacement housing will be available at the earliest possible time but in any event no later than twelve (12) months from the date of the move to temporary housing.

(ii) Replacement housing will be made available on a priority basis, to the individual or family who has been temporarily rehoused.

(iii) The move to temporary rehousing will not, in any way, affect a claimant's eligibility for a replacement housing payment nor deprive him of the same choice or replacement housing units that would have been made available had the temporary move not been made.

(iv) The Commission will pay all costs in connection with the move to temporary housing, including any increased housing costs.

(c)To request Commission approval for a temporary move of a family, the following information shall be submitted to the Commission (additional information may be required on a case-by-case basis):

(1) An explanation of the necessity for the temporary move, based upon the criteria set forth by the Commission.

(2) The estimated duration of the temporary occupancy.

(3) In the case of the family or individual, (i) a copy of the written assurance which will be provided to the person explaining his rights and the continuing obligation of the agency to provide relocation assistance, and (ii) evidence that the family or individual agrees to make the temporary move.

(d)&#x2014;(1)Costs included in a temporary move may cover the following:

(i) Actual reasonable moving costs and related expenses for the move to temporary accommodations.

(ii) For the family or individual moved from a rental unit the difference, if any, between the rental cost of the dwelling vacated and the rental cost of the temporary unit.

(iii) For a homeowner who retains ownership of his dwelling the reasonable cost of renting the temporary dwelling.

(iv) For a homeowner whose dwelling has been acquired the difference, if any, between his housing costs for the acquired dwelling and the rental cost of the temporary unit.

(2)Costs in connection with a move to temporary accommodations are not to be considered as relocation payments under the Act. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)

(e)The costs of a temporary move, as decribed in the foregoing subparagraphs, are not to be considered as all or a part of the relocation payment to which a displaced person is entitled under the Act. Thus, when a family is moved to temporary accommodations, a relocation payment ismade and the election or choice of type of payments that would ordinarily be made upon displacement must be delayed until the final move is made. When the move out of temporary accommodations is made, the displaced person shall receive the full relocation payments to which he/she is entitled pursuant to Commission regulations.

#### Subpart E - Replacement Housing Payments

##### § 700.181 Eligibility.

(a)A certified eligible head of household who established his/her residency requirements in the area partitioned to the tribe of which he/she is not a member, is eligible for the replacement housing payment specified at § 700.183(a).

(b)A payment under this subpart E is subject to the other applicable rules and requirements of these regulations.

##### § 700.183 Determination of replacement housing benefit.

(a)The replacement housing benefit for a certified eligible head-of-household is an amount not to exceed fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) for a household of three or less and not to exceed sixty-six thousand dollars ($66,000) for a household of four or more. Subject to such other requirements of these regulations as may apply, the replacement housing benefit shall be calculated as follows;

(1) The amount of the fair market value of the habitation and improvements purchased from an eligible head-of-household pursuant to subpart B of this part shall be applied first toward the cost of a replacement dwelling.

(2) An additional amount shall be added to the value of the habitation and improvements to equal the cost of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling.

(3) The total value of the replacement dwelling shall not exceed the amount of the replacement housing benefit specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(4) In the event the cost of providing a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling is less than the fair market value of the habitation and improvements purchased from an eligible head-of-household pursuant to subpart B of this part, the difference shall be paid to that head-of-household.

(b) The Commission shall, on or before the first Friday in April of each fiscal year, after consultation with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, annually increase, decrease or leave unadjusted the above limitations on replacement housing benefits to reflect changes in housing or development and construction costs, other than costs of land, during the preceding year. In determining whether to increase or decrease the replacement housing benefit limitations set forth above, the Commission shall consider the following:

(1) The most recent percentage rate of increase or decrease in single family housing construction costs reported by HUD. (General Prototype Housing Costs For One to Four Family Dwelling Units).

(2) The most recent Boecht Building Cost Modifier.

(3) The experience of relocatee families in obtaining replacement housing within the current benefits.

(4) The cost of available replacement housing which meets Commission standards as set forth in these regulations.

(5) Such other available information which the Commission deems appropriate and which is relevant to a determination of whether replacement housing benefits should be increased or decreased to reflect change in housing or development and construction costs during the preceding year.

(c) If the owner retains ownership of his dwelling, moves it from the acquired site, and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the purchase price of the replacement dwelling shall be considered to be the sum of&#x2014;

(1) The cost of the replacement site, if any; plus

(2) The moving and restoration expenses; plus

(3) The costs, if any, incurred to make the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; but not to exceed the above limitation on total replacement home benefits.

##### § 700.187 Utilization of replacement home benefits.

The Commission shall assure that all eligible heads of household receive a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling in the following manner:

(a) If the eligible head of household owns no dwelling other than that on the area from which he or she must move pursuant to the Act, the Commission will make funds available to the head of household as provided in these regulations for the acquisition of a replacement home in one of the following manners:

(1) Purchase of an existing home, by the head of household,

(2) Construction of a home by the head of household,

(3) Participation or purchase by the head of household in a mutual help housing or other home ownership project under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (50 Stat. 888, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 1401) or in any other federally assisted housing program.

(b) If the eligible head of household owns or is buying or building a home in an area other than the area from which he or she must move pursuant to the Act, the Commission will expend relocation benefits in one of the following manners:

(1) If the home is decent, safe, and sanitary, but is encumbered by a mortgage, such mortgage existing as of the effective date of these regulations, the Commission will expend replacement housing benefits up to the maximum then existing benefit to accelerate to the maximum extent possible the achievement by that household of debt-free home ownership.

(2) If the home is owned free and clear but does not meet Commission decent, safe, and sanitary standards, the Commission will, at its discretion, either:

(i) Expend replacement home benefits for improvements to assure the home meets decent, safe, and sanitary standards, or

(ii) Expend replacement home benefits for the acquisition of a replacement dwelling as if the eligible head of household or spouse did not own a home as in paragraph (a) of this section.

(3) If the home is neither owned free and clear nor decent, safe, and sanitary, the Commission will, at its discretion, either:

(i) Expend replacement home benefits for improvements to assure that the home meets decent, safe, and sanitary standards, and to accelerate to the maximium extent possible the achievement of debt-free home ownership, or

(ii) Expend replacement home benefits for the acquisition of a replacement dwelling as if the eligible head of household or spouse did not own a home as in paragraph (a) of this section.

(4) If the home is decent, safe, and sanitary, and is owned free and clear, no replacement home benefits will be paid.

(c) Home improvements shall include the following: General repairs, painting and texturing, fencing&#x2014;including corrals, landscaping, grading, room additions, re-modeling, roofing, insulating, repair or improvements to the water, sewerage, cooling, heating, or electrical systems, storage buildings, energy conservation measures, and other home improvements as determined and defined by the Commission.

(d) In implementing these regulations the Commission will encourage the use of innovative energy or other technologies in order to achieve the minimum monthly housing cost feasible for each replacement house.

##### § 700.189 Expenditure of replacement home benefits.

Replacement home benefits shall be expended or obligated in full at or before the time of original acquisition except as stated below. It is not anticipated that such exceptions would be common and each such instance shall be reviewed and a determination will be made by the Certification Officer.

(a) Under unusual circumstances such as: Unknown (latent) defects in the replacement dwellings, significant change of circumstances and extreme hardship, benefits may be expended after the time of original acquisition up to the existing maximum replacement home benefit.

(b) All replacement home benefits shall be expended not later than one (1) year after the date of payment of the incentive bonus, except under unusual circumstances as stated above, up to the statutory maximum.

##### § 700.211 Basic rights and rules.

The provisions of this subpart do not deprive any displaced person of any rights described elsewhere in these regulations.

#### Subpart J - Inspection of Records

##### § 700.235 Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart contains the regulations of the Commission implementing the requirement of subsection (a)(3) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), which provides that the Commission “upon any request for records which (1) Reasonably describes such records and (2) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.” This subpart describes the procedures by which records may be obtained from the Commission. The procedures in this subpart are not applicable to requests for records published in theor opinions in the adjudication of cases, statements of policy and interpretations and administrative staff manuals which have been published or made available under subpart A of this part.

##### § 700.237 Definitions.

As used in this subpart, “Act” means the “Freedom of Information Act,” 5 U.S.C. 552.

##### § 700.239 Records available.

(a)It is the policy of the Commission to make the records of the Commission available to the public to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act.

(b)The Freedom of Information Act requires that the Commission, on a request from a member of the public to inspect or copy records made in accordance with the procedures in this subpart, shall promptly make the records available.

(c)The Act exempts nine categories of records from this disclosure requirement. The Act provides that disclosure is not required of matters that are:

(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;

(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

(3) Specifically exempt from disclosure by statute;

(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;

(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of such records would

(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,

(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

(iv) Disclose the indentity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,

(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or

(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;

(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

(d)It is the policy of the Commission to withhold information falling within an exemption only if (1) disclosure is prohibited by statute or Executive Order or (2) sound grounds exist for invocation of the exemption.

(e)If a requested record contains material within an exemption together with material not within an exemption and it is determined under the regulations in this subpart to withhold the exempt material, any reasonably segregable nonexempt material shall be separated from the exempt material.

(f)This subpart applies only to records which exist at the time a request for records is made. Records are not required to be created in response to a request by combining or compiling selected items from the files or by preparing a new computer program, nor are records required to be created to provide the requester with such data as proportions, percentages, frequency distributions, trends, or comparisons.

(g)(1) If the release of a record would be of concern to both the Commission and another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the Commission only if the interest of the Commission is the primary interest. If the Commission's interest is not the primary interest, the requester shall be referred in writing to the agency having the primary interest. The Commission has the primary interest in a record if the record was developed pursuant to Commission regulations, directives, or request even though the record originated outside of the Commission.

(2) If the release of a record in which the Commission has a primary interest would be of substantial concern to another agency, the official processing the request, should, if administratively feasible and appropriate, consult with that agency before releasing the record.

(h)If a requested record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the official responsible for processing the request shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, seek the views of that person or entity on whether the record should be released before making a decision on the request.

##### § 700.241 Request for records.

(a)A request to inspect or copy records shall be made to the installation where the records are located. If the records are located at more than one installation or if the specific location of the records is not known to the person wishing to inspect or copy the records, he may direct his request to the head of the appropriate bureau, or the bureau's chief public information officer, if any.

(b)(1) Requests invoking the Freedom of Information Act shall be in writing.

(2)(i) A request must reasonably describe the records requested. A request reasonably describes the records requested if it will enable an employee of the Commission familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If such information is available, the request should identify the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, and the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the record, and any other information which will assist in location of the requested records. If the request involves a matter known by the requester to be in litigation, the request should also state the case name and court hearing the case.

(ii) If the description of a record sought is insufficient to allow identification and location of the record, the response denying the request on this ground shall so state and, to the extent possible, indicate what additional descriptive information, if any, would assist in location of the record.

(3) A request shall state the maximum amount of fees which the requester is willing to pay. Requesters are notified that under § 700.251, the failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated by the Commission will delay running of the time limit and delay processing of the request, if the responsible official anticipates that the fees chargeable may exceed $25.00.

(4)(i) To insure expeditious handling, requests shall be prominently marked, both on the envelope and on the face of the request, with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” The failure of a request to bear such a legend will not disqualify a request from processing under the procedures in this subpart if the request otherwise meets the requirments of this section. A request not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” will not, however, be deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in § 700.245 until it has been identified by bureau personnel as a Freedom of Information request and marked by them with this legend.

(ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the public not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” as a request otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.” (B) date the request to reflect the date on which it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the request under the procedures in this subpart.

(d)(1) A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if (i) it can be determined which particular records are covered by the request and (ii) the records can be searched for, collected and produced without unduly burdening or interfering with Commission operations because of the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of the files.

(2) If a categorical request is determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section not to reasonably describe the records requested, the response denying the request on that ground shall specify the reasons why and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with knowledgeable Commission personnel in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions by reformulation and by agreeing on an orderly procedure for the production of the records.

##### § 700.243 Action on initial requests.

(a)(1) A requested record shall be made available if (i) the record is not exempt from disclosure or (ii) the record is exempt from disclosure, but its withholding is neither required by statute or Executive order nor supported by sound grounds.

(b)(1) When a requested record has been determined to be available, the official processing the request shall immediately notify the person requesting the record as to where and when the record is available for inspection or as the case may be, where and when copies will be available. If fees are due under § 700.251, the responsible official shall also state the amount or, if the exact amount cannot be determined, the approximate amount of fees due.

(2) If the record was obtained by the Commission from a person or entity outside of the Government, the responsible official shall, when it is administratively feasible to do so, notify that person or entity that the record has been made available.

(c)(1) A request for a record may be denied only if it is determined that (i) the record is exempt from disclosure and (ii) that withholding of the record is required by statute or Executive order or supported by sound grounds.

(2) A request to inspect or copy a record shall be denied only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or by an official whom the Executive Director has in writing designated.

(d)A reply denying a request shall be in writing and shall include:

(1) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of the record;

(2) The sound ground for withholding;

(3) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial;

(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to § 700.247 and that such appeal must be in writing and be received by this official within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the denial, in the case of the denial of an entire request, or within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) of records being made available, in the case of a partial denial, by writing to the Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.

(e)The requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section do not apply to requests denied under § 2.14 on the ground that the request did not reasonably describe the records requested or to requests for records which do not exist.

(f)Copies of all replies denying, in whole or part, a request for a record which are issued under this section of § 700.243 shall be promptly submitted by the Freedom of Information Act Officer, denials to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.

##### § 700.245 Time limits on processing of initial requests.

(a)Requests for records shall be processed promptly. A determination whether to grant or deny a request shall be made within no more than ten (10) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of a request. This determination shall be communicated immediately to the requester.

(b)For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the time limit commences to run when a request is received at the Commission's office in Flagstaff, Arizona.

(c)In the following unusual circumstances, the time limit for acting upon an initial request may be extended to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, but in no case may the time limit be extended for more than ten (10) working days:

(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;

(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

(d)(1) An extension of time under paragraph (c) of this section may be made only by the Freedom of Information Act Officer or such higher authority as the Commission has in writing designated.

(2) The person requesting the records shall be notified in writing of the extension. The written notice shall state the reason for the extension and the date on which a determination on the request is expected to be dispatched.

(3) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.

(e)(1) If no determination has been reached at the end of the ten (10) day period for deciding an initial request, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his request denied and may exercise a right of appeal in accordance with the provisions of § 700.247.

(2) When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the responsible official shall nevertheless continue to process the request. On expiration of the time limit, the responsible official shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to treat the delay as a denial for purposes of appeal to the Commission in accordance with § 700.247. The requester may be asked to consider delaying use of his right to appeal until the date on which the determination is expected to be dispatched. If the requester so agrees, he is deemed not to have treated the failure to respond within the applicable time limit as a denial for purposes of the running of the twenty (20) working-day appeal period set out in § 700.247. If a determination of the request is not issued by the new agreed upon date, or if the request is denied in whole or part, the requester will have available his full right of appeal under § 700.247, including the entire twenty (20) working-day period for filing of the appeal.

##### § 700.247 Appeals.

(a)Where a request for records has been denied, in whole or part, the person submitting the request may appeal the denial to the Commission.

(b)An appeal must be received no later than twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after the date of the initial denial, in the case of a denial of an entire request, or twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays excepted) after records have been made available, in the case of a partial denial.

(c)(1) An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by copies of the original request and the initial denial and should, in order to expedite the appellate process and give the requester an opportunity to present his arguments, contain a brief statement of the reasons why the requester believes the initial denial to have been in error.

(2) The appeal shall be addressed to Freedom of Information Act Officer, Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002.

(3)(i) Both the envelope containing the notice of appeal and the face of the notice shall bear the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL”. The failure of an appeal to bear such a legend will not disqualify an appeal from processing under § 2.18 if the appeal otherwise meets the requirements of this section. An appeal not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL” will not, however, be deemed to have been received for purposes of the running of the time limit set out in § 700.249 until it has been identified by Commission personnel as a Freedom of Information appeal and marked by them with this legend.

(ii) Commission personnel identifying a communication from the public not bearing the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL” as an appeal otherwise meeting the requirements of this section shall immediately (A) mark the communication with the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL,” (B) date the appeal to reflect the date on which it was identified, and (C) take steps to assure proper processing of the appeal under the procedures in this subpart.

(4) The Freedom of Information Act Officer shall be responsible for promptly furnishing copies of such notices to the Executive Director and the Commission's legal counsel.

##### § 700.249 Action on appeals.

(a)Appeals from initial denials of requests for records shall be decided for the Commission by the Executive Director after consultation with the Commission's legal counsel.

(b)A final determination on any appeal shall be made within twenty (20) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and public legal holidays) after receipt of the appeal.

(c)(1) If the time limit for responding to the initial request for a record was not extended under the provisions of § 700.245 or was extended for fewer than ten (10) working days, the time for processing of the appeal may be extended by the Executive Director to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the appeal, but in no event may the extension, when taken together with any extension made during processing of the initial request, result in an aggregate extension with respect to any one request of more than ten (10) working days. The time for processing of an appeal may be extended only if one or more of the unusual circumstances listed in § 700.245(c) requires an extension.

(2) The Executive Director shall, in writing, advise the appellant of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a final determination of the appeal is expected to be dispatched.

(3) If no determination on the appeal has been reached at the end of the twenty (20) working-day period for deciding an appeal, or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be reached within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless continue to be processed. On expiration of the time limit, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of his right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to consider delaying resort to his right to judicial review until the date on which the determination on his appeal is expected to be dispatched.

(i) Furnishing unauthenticated copies of any documents reproduced for gratuitous distribution;

(ii) Furnishing one copy of a personal document (e.g., a birth certificate) to a person who has been required to furnish it for retention by the Commission;

(iii) Furnishing one copy of the transcript of a hearing before a hearing officer in a grievance or similar proceeding to the employee for whom the hearing was held.

(vi) Furnishing records when to do so is in conformance with generally established business custom (e.g., furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Commission employees);

(vii) Furnishing one copy of a record in order to assist the requester to obtain financial benefits to which he is entitled (e.g., veterans or their dependents, employees with Government employee compensation claims or persons insured by the Government).

(d)(1) Where it is anticipated that fees chargeable under this section may amount to more than $25.00 and the requester has not indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the request shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the time limits established by § 700.245 until the requester is advised of the fees which are anticipated and has agreed to pay these fees. Advice to requesters with respect to anticipated fees shall be provided promptly.

(2) The appropriate cases, advance payment of fees may be required before requested records are made available to the requester.

(3) A notice of anticipated fees or notice of request for advance payment shall extend an offer to the requester to confer with appropriate personnel in an attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the anticipated fees and meet the needs of the requester.

(b) Commission personnel conducting business with contractors, realtors, vendors, service providers and other public and private agencies, organizations, business and individuals shall maintain strict impartiality in their business dealings. Commission employees shall not allow themselves to be placed in a position in which a conflict of interest might arise or might justifiably be suspected. Such a conflict may arise or appear to arise by the acceptance of gratuities or by any action which could reasonably be interpreted as influencing the strict impartiality that must prevail in all business relationships involving the Commission. However, this requirement of impartiality is not intended to prohibit advocacy of client interests, as is required as a stated duty of certain agency positions. Such advocacy may occur for example during warrantee representation or during technical representation with builders.

##### § 700.515 Conflicts of interest.

(a) A conflict of interest may exist when an employee uses, or appears to use, his or her official position to obtain benefits for himself or herself, close friends, relatives, or business associates.

If an employee has any doubt about whether or not a particular situation is, or gives the appearance of being a conflict of interest, the situation should be discussed with the immediate supervisor. Should further review be required, the Designated Agency Ethics Official shall be consulted.

(b) Principal situations where conflict of interest may develop are regulated by the sections which follow. However, these regulations do not preclude other conflict of interest situations which may arise in connection with the work of the Commission.

##### § 700.517 Affiliations and financial interests.

(a) Commission personnel shall not engage in any personal, business, or professional activity, or receive or retain any direct or indirect financial interest, which places them in a position of conflict or apparent conflict between their private interests and the public interests of the United States as related to the duties of their Commission positions.

(b) Employees are prohibited from accepting money, goods or services other than official compensation for any act performed by the employee as part of his or her official duties.

(e) Employees may not have any personal interest in transactions which are directed, regulated, or effected by the Commission pursuant to the authorities vested in the agency by Pub. L. 93&#x2013;531 and Pub. L. 96&#x2013;395. Specifically:

(1) No Commission employee shall have a personal interest in a contract, subcontract, memorandum of understanding or agreement, or other arrangement resulting in payment for the delivery of goods, services, or supplies to the Commission, to the Navajo or Hopi tribal governments, or to individual relocatees or groups of relocatees.

(5) Nothing in this section shall restrict a relocatee's right to exercise free and independent judgment in selecting a realtor, contractor, or other vendor or service provider; regardless of any personal or business relationship of that entity to a Commission employee, provided the employee has not influenced the choice of the relocatee in any manner.

(6) Nothing in this section shall restrict a Commission employee who is eligible for relocation benefits from applying for and obtaining such benefits according to published criteria; nor to prevent the Commission from employing a member of the Hopi or Navajo Tribe who has been, or is in the process, of being relocated pursuant to the law.

(7) Commission employees shall disqualify themselves from investigating and preparing recommendations regarding eligibility determination for applicants to whom they are closely related by blood or marriage.

##### § 700.519 Gifts, entertainment and favors.

(a) Acceptance of gratuities, including gifts, entertainment and favors, (no matter how innocently tendered or received) from those who have or seek business dealings with the Commission, is prohibited as it may be a source of embarrassment to the recipient, and may impair public confidence in the integrity of the conduct of the Government's business. It is emphasized that prohibited conflicts and apparent conficts of interest can sometimes arise even from relationships and transactions that the persons concerned perceive as inconsequential.

(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, Commission personnel and their spouses, minor children and members of their households shall not solicit nor accept, either directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment loan or any other thing of monetary value from any person who:

(3) An employee may accept an invitation extended by a relocatee to attend a housewarming, potluck, accept a meal and refreshments while traveling on the reservation, or similar social activity when circumstances would make it rude for the employee to refuse.

(4) Other circumstances may arise in which it would be to the Commission's advantage for an employee to participate in activities ordinarily prohibited. In such cases, the employee shall consult with his or her supervisor about the course of action to be followed. If prior consultation is not possible, the employee shall exercise prudent judgement and promptly inform the supervisor of the activity.

##### § 700.521 Outside work and interests.

Commission employees may engage in outside work or other activity which does not create a conflict between the employee's private interests and official duties nor prevent employees from devoting their talents and energies to the Commission. An employee's outside work shall not reflect discredit upon the Commission.

(a) Employees engaged in or considering outside employment shall inform their supervisor of the work, and supply such additional details as may be required to determine whether the employment is compatible with the full and proper discharge of the employee's official duties.

(b) Similarly, employees shall inform the supervisor and request approval of other types of outside activities which may present an actual or apparent conflict of interest between the employees' official duties and their private lives. The supervisor shall determine if the outside employment or activity is prohibited by these regulations, and so inform the employee. The Designated Agency Ethics Official is available to assist supervisors in making such determinations.

(c)Outside employment or other outside activity is incompatible with the full and proper discharge of an employee's duties and responsibilities and hence is prohibited if:

(1) It would involve the violation of a Federal or State statute, a local ordinance, Executive Order, or regulation to which the employee is subject.

(2) It would be of such extent or nature as to interfere with the efficient performance of the employee's Government duties, or impair the employee's mental or physical capacity to perform them in an acceptable manner.

(3) It would tend to influence the exercise or impartial judgement on any matters coming before the employee in the course of his or her duties;

(4) It would involve work for contractors, subcontractors, realtors, tribal offices, clients or other entities and individuals which have business with or receive services from the Commission or conduct activities which are regulated by the Commission.

(5) Involves a person or enterprise that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties.

(6) It involves the use of the employee's time during official working hours.

(7) It involves the receipt of salary or anything of monetary value from a private source as compensation for services to the Government.

(8) It involves acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or any other thing of monetary value under circumstances in which acceptance might result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest.

(9) It would be of a nature which might be construed by the general public to be an official act of the Commission, or would give the impression that a business or product which is involved in the relocation project is officially endorsed or approved by the Commission.

(10) It would involve use by the employee of official facilities, e.g., office space, office machines, or supplies, or the services of other employees during duty hours.

(11) It might bring discredit upon, or cause unfavorable criticism of, the Government or the Commission or lead to relationships which might impair public confidence in the integrity of the Government or the Commission.

(12) It would involve the use of information obtained as a result of Government employment that is not freely available to the general public in that it either has not been made available to the general public or would not be made available upon request.

(c) Employees must obtain supervisory approval for release of information considered confidential, and release of information not previously published as public information.

(d) Disclosure of information from records shall conform with the provisions of the Freedom of information and the Privacy Acts (5 U.S.C. 552). An employee may not release confidential information maintained by the Commission and available to the employee because of his position as an employee of the Commission. Violation of this prohibition may result in prosecution under the terms of the Privacy Act in addition to any disciplinary penalties levied by the employee's supervisor.

(e) Commission personnel may not accept compensation for an article, speech, consultant service, or other activity if it involves the use of information obtained as the result of Government employment which is not available to the general public as described in paragraph (a) of this section, or results in an actual or appearance of conflict of interest.

(f) Unless there is a definite Commission position on a matter which is the subject of an employee's writing or speech, and the individual has been authorized by the Commissioners to present that position officially, the employee shall expressly present his or her views on the matter as his or her own and not as those of the Commission.

All employees must be allowed to work in an environment free from unsolicited and unwelcome sexual overtures. Sexual harassment is defined by the Office of Personnel Management as “deliberate or repeated unsolicited verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature which are unwelcome.” Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments. It refers to behavior which is not welcome, which is personally offensive and debilitates morale, interfering with the work effectiveness of its victims and their co-workers.

(b) When Indian tribal lands are involved in an application for a permit or a request for extension or modification of a permit, the consent of the Indian tribal government must be obtained. For Indian allotted lands outside reservation boundaries, consent from only the individual landowner is needed. When multiple-owner allotted lands are involved, consent by more than 50 percent of the ownership interest is sufficient. For Indian allotted lands within reservation boundaries, consent must be obtained from the Navajo Nation and the individual landowner(s).

(c) The applicant should consult with the Office concerning procedures for obtaining consent from the appropriate Indian tribal authorities and submit the permit application to the Office. The Office shall ensure that consultation with the Navajo Nation or individual Indian landowner regarding terms and conditions of the permit occurs prior to detailed evaluation of the application. Permits shall include terms and conditions requested by the Navajo Nation or Indian landowner pursuant to § 700.817 of this part.

(d) The issuance of a permit under this part does not remove the requirement for any other permit by Indian tribal law.

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

(2)In meeting the requirements of § 720.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 720.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include&#x2014;

(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

(a) Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151&#x2013;4157), as established in 41 CFR 101&#x2013;19.600 to 101&#x2013;19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

(b) The agency shall ensure that any dwelling that is constructed for a relocatee household is designed and constructed so as to be readily accessible to and usable by any handicapped person who is a member of that household.

(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 720.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

##### § 900.3 Policy statements.

(a)(1) Congress has recognized the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction, planning, conduct and administration of educational as well as other Federal programs and services to Indian communities so as to render such programs and services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.

(2) Congress has declared its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.

(3) Congress has declared that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.

(4) Congress has declared that the programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted and funded under this Act shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractible. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractible without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions. Contracting of the administrative functions described herein shall not be construed to limit or reduce in any way the funding for any program, function, service, or activity serving any other tribe under the Act or any other law. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another Indian tribe or tribal organization under this Act.

(5) Congress has further declared that each provision of the Act and each provision of contracts entered into thereunder shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the tribes or tribal organizations to transfer the funding and the related functions, services, activities, and programs (or portions thereof), that are otherwise contractible under the Act, including all related administrative functions, from the Federal government to the contractor.

(6) Congress has declared that one of the primary goals of the 1994 amendments to the Act was to minimize the reporting requirements applicable to tribal contractors and to eliminate excessive and burdensome reporting requirements. Reporting requirements over and above the annual audit report are to be negotiated with disagreements subject to the declination procedures of section 102 of the Act.

(7) Congress has declared that there not be any threshold issues which would avoid the declination, contract review, approval, and appeal process.

(8) Congress has declared that all self-determination contract proposals must be supported by the resolution of an Indian tribe(s).

(9) Congress has declared that to the extent that programs, functions, services, and activities carried out by tribes and tribal organizations pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of contract funds determined under section 106(a) of the Act, the Secretary shall make such savings available for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries, either directly or through contractors, in a manner equitable to both direct and contracted programs.

(b)(1) It is the policy of the Secretary to facilitate the efforts of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to plan, conduct and administer programs, functions, services and activities, or portions thereof, which the Departments are authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians. The Secretary shall make best efforts to remove any obstacles which might hinder Indian tribes and tribal organizations including obstacles that hinder tribal autonomy and flexibility in the administration of such programs.

(2) It is the policy of the Secretary to encourage Indian tribes and tribal organizations to become increasingly knowledgeable about the Departments' programs administered for the benefit of Indians by providing information on such programs, functions and activities and the opportunities Indian tribes have regarding them.

(3) It is the policy of the Secretary to provide a uniform and consistent set of rules for contracts under the Act. The rules contained herein are designed to facilitate and encourage Indian tribes to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs serving Indian people. The Secretary shall afford Indian tribes and tribal organizations the flexibility, information, and discretion necessary to design contractible programs to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious and institutional needs.

(4) The Secretary recognizes that contracting under the Act is an exercise by Indian tribes of the government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. When an Indian tribe contracts, there is a transfer of the responsibility with the associated funding. The tribal contractor is accountable for managing the day-to-day operations of the contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities. The contracting tribe thereby accepts the responsibility and accountability to the beneficiaries under the contract with respect to use of the funds and the satisfactory performance of the programs, functions, services and activities funded under the contract. The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of Indian tribes and the trust resources of individual Indians.

(5) The Secretary recognizes that tribal decisions to contract or not to contract are equal expressions of self-determination.

(6) The Secretary shall maintain consultation with tribal governments and tribal organizations in the Secretary's budget process relating to programs, functions, services and activities subject to the Act. In addition, on an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code).

(7) The Secretary is committed to implementing and fully supporting the policy of Indian self-determination by recognizing and supporting the many positive and successful efforts and directions of tribal governments and extending the applicability of this policy to all operational components within the Department. By fully extending Indian self-determination contracting to all operational components within the Department having programs or portions of programs for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) and for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E), it is the Secretary's intent to support and assist Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments capable of administering quality programs that meet the tribally determined needs and directions of their respective communities. It is also the policy of the Secretary to have all other operational components within the Department work cooperatively with tribal governments on a government-to-government basis so as to expedite the transition away from Federal domination of Indian programs and make the ideals of Indian self-government and self-determination a reality.

(8) It is the policy of the Secretary that the contractibility of programs under this Act should be encouraged. In this regard, Federal laws and regulations should be interpreted in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of those programs or portions of those programs that are for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act, and that are for the benefit of Indians because of their status of Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E) of the Act.

(9) It is the Secretary's policy that no later than upon receipt of a contract proposal under the Act (or written notice of an Indian tribe or tribal organization's intention to contract), the Secretary shall commence planning such administrative actions, including but not limited to transfers or reductions in force, transfers of property, and transfers of contractible functions, as may be necessary to ensure a timely transfer of responsibilities and funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

(10) It is the policy of the Secretary to make available to Indian tribes and tribal organizations all administrative functions that may lawfully be contracted under the Act, employing methodologies consistent with the methodology employed with respect to such functions under titles III and IV of the Act.

(11) The Secretary's commitment to Indian self-determination requires that these regulations be liberally construed for the benefit of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to effectuate the strong Federal policy of self-determination and, further, that any ambiguities herein be construed in favor of the Indian tribe or tribal organization so as to facilitate and enable the transfer of services, programs, functions, and activities, or portions thereof, authorized by the Act.

(a) Affecting, modifying, diminishing, or otherwise impairing the sovereign immunity from suit enjoyed by Indian tribes;

##### § 900.25 What if only a portion of a proposal raises one of the five declination criteria?

The Secretary must approve any severable portion of a proposal that does not support a declination finding described in § 900.20, subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization approve.

##### § 900.26 What happens if the Secretary declines a part of a proposal on the ground that the proposal proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a program, function, service or activity that is beyond the scope of programs covered under section 102(a) of the Act, or proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under section 106(a) of the Act?

In those situations the Secretary is required, as appropriate, to approve the portion of the program, function, service, or activity that is authorized under section 102(a) of the Act, or approve a level of funding that is authorized under section 106(a) of the Act. As noted in § 900.25, the approval is subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization approve.

##### § 900.27 If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to contract for a severable portion of a proposal, does the Indian tribe or tribal organization lose its appeal rights to challenge the portion of the proposal that was declined?

Yes. The Indian tribe or tribal organization is entitled to an appeal on the objections raised by the Secretary, with an agency hearing on the record, and the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter. The procedures for appeals are in subpart L of these regulations. Alternatively, at its option the Indian tribe or tribal organization has the right to sue in Federal district court to challenge the Secretary's decision.

##### § 900.32 Can the Secretary decline an Indian tribe or tribal organization's proposed successor annual funding agreement?

No. If it is substantially the same as the prior annual funding agreement (except for funding increases included in appropriations acts or funding reductions as provided in section 106(b) of the Act) and the contract is with DHHS or the BIA, the Secretary shall approve and add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled, and may not decline, any portion of a successor annual funding agreement. Any portion of an annual funding agreement proposal which is not substantially the same as that which was funded previously (e.g., a redesign proposal; waiver proposal; different proposed funding amount; or different program, service, function, or activity), or any annual funding agreement proposal which pertains to a contract with an agency of DOI other than the BIA, is subject to the declination criteria and procedures in subpart E. If there is a disagreement over the availability of appropriations, the Secretary may decline the proposal in part under the procedure in subpart E.

##### § 900.33 Are all proposals to renew term contracts subject to the declination criteria?

Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Indian Affairs will not review the renewal of a term contract for declination issues where no material and substantial change to the scope or funding of a program, functions, services, or activities has been proposed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Proposals to renew term contracts with DOI agencies other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs may be reviewed under the declination criteria.

#### Subpart F - Standards for Tribal or Tribal Organization Management Systems

The extent of available resources will be a consideration in the negotiations.

##### § 900.66 What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot come to an agreement concerning the type and/or frequency of program narrative and/or program data report(s)?

Any disagreements over reporting requirements are subject to the declination criteria and procedures in section 102 of the Act and subpart E.

##### § 900.67 Will there be a uniform data set for all IHS programs?

IHS will work with Indian tribe or tribal organization representatives to develop a mutually defined uniform subset of data that is consistent with Congressional intent, imposes a minimal reporting burden, and which responds to the needs of the contracting parties.

##### § 900.68 Will this uniform data set be required of all Indian tribe or tribal organizations contracting with the IHS under the Act?

No. The uniform data set, applicable to the services to be performed, will serve as the target for the Secretary and the Indian tribes or tribal organizations during individual negotiations on program data reporting requirements.

#### Subpart H - Lease of Tribally-Owned Buildings by the Secretary

##### § 900.69 What is the purpose of this subpart?

Section 105(l) of the Act requires the Secretary, at the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, to enter into a lease with the Indian tribe or tribal organization for a building owned or leased by the tribe or tribal organization that is used for administration or delivery of services under the Act. The lease is to include compensation as provided in the statute as well as “such other reasonable expenses that the Secretary determines, by regulation, to be allowable.” This subpart contains requirements for these leases.

##### § 900.70 What elements are included in the compensation for a lease entered into between the Secretary and an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a building owned or leased by the Indian tribe or tribal organization that is used for administration or delivery of services under the Act?

#### Subpart I - Property Donation Procedures

#### Subpart J - Construction

##### § 900.110 What does this subpart cover?

(a) This subpart establishes requirements for issuing fixed-price or cost-reimbursable contracts to provide: design, construction, repair, improvement, expansion, replacement, erection of new space, or demolition and other related work for one or more Federal facilities. It applies to tribal facilities where the Secretary is authorized by law to design, construct and/or renovate, or make improvements to such tribal facilities.

(b) Activities covered by construction contracts under this subpart are: design and architectural/engineering services, construction project management, and the actual construction of the building or facility in accordance with the construction documents, including all labor, materials, equipment, and services necessary to complete the work defined in the construction documents.

(1) Such contracts may include the provision of movable equipment, telecommunications and data processing equipment, furnishings (including works of art), and special purpose equipment, when part of a construction contract let under this subpart.

(2) While planning services and construction management services as defined in § 900.113 may be included in a construction contract under this subpart, they may also be contracted separately using the model agreement in section 108 of the Act.

##### § 900.111 What activities of construction programs are contractible?

The Secretary shall, upon the request of any Indian tribe or tribal organization authorized by tribal resolution, enter into a self-determination contract to plan, conduct, and administer construction programs or portions thereof.

##### § 900.112 What are construction phases?

(a) Construction programs generally include the following activities in phases which can vary by funding source (an Indian tribe or tribal organization should contact its funding source for more information regarding the conduct of its program):

(1)The phase during which an initial assessment and determination of project need is made and supporting information collected for presentation in a project application. This project application process is explained in more detail in § 900.122;

(2)The phase during which planning services are provided. This phase can include conducting and preparing a detailed needs assessment, developing justification documents, completing and/or verifying master plans, conducting predesign site investigations and selection, developing budget cost estimates, conducting feasibility studies, and developing a project Program of Requirements (POR);

(3)The phase during which licensed design professional(s) using the POR as the basis for design of the project, prepare project plans, specifications, and other documents that are a part of the construction documents used to build the project. Site investigation and selection activities are completed in this phase if not conducted as part of the planning phase.

(4)The phase during which the project is constructed. The construction phase includes providing the labor, materials, equipment, and services necessary to complete the work in accordance with the construction documents prepared as part of the design phase.

(b) The following activities may be part of phases described in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section:

(1) Management; and

(2) Environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic preservation, and similar assessments and associated activities.

##### § 900.113 Definitions.

(a)means a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement self-determination contract for a construction project, except that such term does not include any contract:

(1) That is limited to providing planning services and construction management services (or a combination of such services);

(2) For the Housing Improvement Program or roads maintenance program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs administered by the Secretary of the Interior; or

(3) For the health facility maintenance and improvement program administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

(b)(CMS) means activities limited to administrative support services; coordination; and monitoring oversight of the planning, design, and construction process. An Indian tribe or tribal organization's employee or construction management services consultant (typically an engineer or architect) performs such activities as:

(1) Coordination and information exchange between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Federal government;

(2) Preparation of Indian tribe or tribal organization's construction contract proposals;

(3) Indian tribe or tribal organization subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of Indian tribe or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors (see § 900.110);

(4) Review of work to ensure compliance with the POR and/or the construction contract. This does not involve construction project management as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.

(c)include programs for the planning, design, construction, repair, improvement, and expansion of buildings or facilities, including but not limited to, housing, law enforcement and detention facilities, sanitation and water systems, roads, schools, administration and health facilities, irrigation and agricultural work, water conservation, flood control, and port facilities, and environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic preservation, and conduct of similar assessments.

(d)means direct responsibility for the construction project through day-to-day on-site management and administration of the project. Activities may include cost management, project budgeting, project scheduling, procurement services.

(e)means services performed by licensed design professionals related to preparing drawings, specifications, and other design submissions specified in the contract, as well as services provided by or for licensed design professionals during the bidding/negotiating, construction, and operational phases of the project.

(f)means activities undertaken to support agency and/or Congressional funding of a construction project. Planning services may include performing a needs assessment, completing and/or verifying master plans, developing justification documents, conducting pre-design site investigations, developing budget cost estimates, conducting feasibility studies as needed and completion of approved justification documents and a program of requirements (POR) for the project.

(g)(POR) is a planning document developed during the planning phase for an individual project. It provides background about the project; site information; programmatic needs; and, for facilities projects, a detailed room-by-room listing of spaces, including net and gross sizes, finish materials to be used, furnishings and equipment, and other information and design criteria on which to base the construction project documents.

(h)means the description of the work to be provided through a contract issued under this subpart and the methods and processes to be used to accomplish that work. A scope of work is typically developed based on criteria provided in a POR during the design phase, and project construction documents (plans and specifications) during the construction phase.

##### § 900.114 Why is there a separate subpart in these regulations for construction contracts and grants?

There is a separate subpart because the Act differentiates between construction contracts and the model agreement in section 108 of the Act which is required for contracting other activities. Construction contracts are separately defined in the Act and are subject to a separate proposal and review process.

##### § 900.115 How do self-determination construction contracts relate to ordinary Federal procurement contracts?

(a) A self-determination construction contract is a government-to-government agreement that transfers control of the construction project, including administrative functions, to the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization to facilitate effective and meaningful participation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in planning, conducting, and administering the construction project, and so that the construction project is responsive to the true needs of the Indian community. The Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in § 900.131.

(b) Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional “procurement” contracts.

(1) With respect to a construction contract (or a subcontract of such a construction contract), the provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401) and the regulations promulgated under that Act, shall apply to a construction contract or subcontract only to the extent that application of the provision is:

(i) Necessary to ensure that the contract may be carried out in a satisfactory manner;

(ii) Directly related to the construction activity; and

(iii) Not inconsistent with the Act.

(2) A list of the Federal requirements that meet the requirements of this paragraph shall be included in an attachment to the contract under negotiations between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no Federal law listed in section 105(3)(C)(ii) of the Act or any other provision of Federal law (including an Executive order) relating to acquisition by the Federal government shall apply to a construction contract that an Indian tribe or tribal organization enters into under this Act, unless expressly provided in the law.

(c) Provisions of a construction contract under this subpart shall be liberally construed in favor of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization.

##### § 900.116 Are negotiated fixed-price contracts treated the same as cost-reimbursable contracts?

Yes, except that in negotiated fixed-price construction contracts, appropriate clauses shall be negotiated to allocate properly the contract risks between the government and the contractor.

##### § 900.117 Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to planning services?

(a) These regulations apply to planning services contracts only as provided in this section.

(1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit to the Secretary for review and approval the POR documents produced as a part of a model contract under section 108 of the Act or under a construction contract under this subpart.

(i) Within 60 days after receipt of the POR from the Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that has achieved priority ranking or that is funded, the Secretary shall:

(A) Approve the POR;

(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR that the Secretary may have; or

(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 60 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.

(ii) Within a maximum of 180 days after receipt of a POR from an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that is not funded and is not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall:

(A) Approve the POR; or

(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR; or

(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 180 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.

(2) Any failure of the Secretary to act on a POR within the applicable period required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be deemed a rejection of the POR and will authorize the commencement of any appeal as provided in section 110 of the Act, or, if a model agreement under section 108 of the Act is used, the disputes provision of that agreement.

(3) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to provide planning services as part of a construction contract rather than under a model agreement as set out in section 108 of the Act, the regulations in this subpart shall apply.

(b) The parties to the contract are encouraged to consult during the development of the POR and following submission of the POR to the Secretary.

##### § 900.118 Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to construction management services?

No. Construction management services may be contracted separately under section 108 of the Act. Construction management services consultants and/or Indian tribe or tribal organization employees assist and advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization to implement construction contracts, but have no contractual relationship with or authority to direct construction contract subcontractors.

(a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses to contract solely for construction management services, these services shall be limited to:

(1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary;

(2) Review of work produced by the Secretary to determine compliance with:

(i) The POR and design contract during the design stage; or

(ii) The project construction documents during the construction stage;

(3) Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the disputes clause of the CMS contract.

(b) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization conducts CMS under section 108 of the Act and the Indian tribe or tribal organization contracts separately under this subpart for all or some of the activities in § 900.110, the contracted activities shall be limited to:

(1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and Secretary;

(2) Preparation of tribal or tribal organization construction subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of tribal or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors;

(3) Review of work produced by tribal or tribal organization construction subcontractors to determine compliance with:

(i) The POR and the design contract during the design stage; or

(ii) The project construction documents during the construction stage.

##### § 900.119 To what extent shall the Secretary consult with affected Indian tribes before spending funds for any construction project?

Before spending any funds for a planning, design, construction, or renovation project, whether subject to a competitive application and ranking process or not, the Secretary shall consult with any Indian tribe or tribal organization(s) that would be significantly affected by the expenditure to determine and to follow tribal preferences to the greatest extent feasible concerning: size, location, type, and other characteristics of the project.

##### § 900.120 How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization find out about a construction project?

Within 30 days after the Secretary's allocation of funds for planning phase, design phase, or construction phase activities for a specific project, the Secretary shall notify, by registered mail with return receipt in order to document mailing, the Indian tribe or tribal organization(s) to be benefitted by the availability of the funds for each phase of a project. The Secretarial notice of fund allocation shall offer technical assistance in the preparation of a contract proposal.

(a) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, furnish the Indian tribe or tribal organization with all information available to the Secretary about the project including, but not limited to: construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports and archeological reports.

(b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to request this information prior to submitting a notification of intent to contract or a contract proposal.

(c) The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility to furnish information.

##### § 900.121 What happens during the preplanning phase and can an Indian tribe or tribal organization perform any of the activities involved in this process?

(a) The application and ranking process for developing a priority listing of projects varies between agencies. There are, however, steps in the selection process that are common to most selection processes. An Indian tribe or tribal organization that wishes to secure a construction project should contact the appropriate agency to determine the specific steps involved in the application and selection process used to fund specific types of projects. When a priority process is used in the selection of construction projects, the steps involved in the application and ranking process are as follows:

(1)The agency solicits applications from Indian tribes or tribal organizations. In the request for applications, the Secretary provides specific information regarding the type of project to be funded, the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate applications, the points or weight that each criterion will be assigned, and the time when applications are due. An Indian tribe or tribal organization may prepare the application (technical assistance from the agency, within resources available, shall be provided upon request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization) or may rely upon the agency to prepare the application.

(2)The Secretary evaluates the applications based on the criteria provided as part of the application preparation process. The Secretary applies only criteria and weights assigned to each criteria that were disclosed to the Indian tribe or tribal organization during the application stage. The applications are then ranked in order from the application that best meets application criteria to the application that least meet the application criteria.

(3)Before final acceptance of a ranked application, the information, such as demographic information, deficiency levels reported in application, the condition of existing facilities, and program housing needs, is validated. During this process, additional information may be developed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in support of the original information or the Secretary may designate a representative of the Department to conduct an on-site review of the information contained in the application.

(b) [Reserved]

##### § 900.122 What does an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if it wants to secure a construction contract?

(a) The Act establishes a special process for review and negotiation of proposals for construction contracts which is different than that for other self-determination contract proposals. The Indian tribe or tribal organization should notify the Secretary of its intent to contract. After notification, the Indian tribe or tribal organization should prepare its contract proposal in accordance with the sections of this subpart. While developing its construction contract proposal, the Indian tribe or tribal organization can request technical assistance from the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the Secretary shall provide to the Indian tribe or tribal organization all information available about the construction project, including construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports, and archaeological reports. The responsibility of the Secretary to furnish this information shall be a continuing one.

(b) At the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization and before finalizing its construction contract proposal, the Secretary shall provide for a precontract negotiation phase during the development of a contract proposal. Within 30 days the Secretary shall acknowledge receipt of the proposal and, if requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, shall confer with the Indian tribe or tribal organization to develop a negotiation schedule. The negotiation phase shall include, at a minimum:

(1) The provision of technical assistance under section 103 of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) A joint scoping session between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization to review all plans, specifications, engineering reports, cost estimates, and other information available to the parties, for the purpose of identifying all areas of agreement and disagreement;

(3) An opportunity for the Secretary to revise plans, designs, or cost estimates of the Secretary in response to concerns raised, or information provided by, the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

(4) A negotiation session during which the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall seek to develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal; and

(5) Upon the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve remaining areas of disagreement under the dispute resolution provisions under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of the United States Code.

##### § 900.123 What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal?

(a) If the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization are unable to develop a mutually agreeable construction contract proposal under the procedures in § 900.122, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may submit a final contract proposal to the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving the final contract proposal, the Secretary shall approve the contract proposal and award the contract, unless, during the period the Secretary declines the proposal under sections 102(a)(2) and 102(b) of the Act (including providing opportunity for an appeal under section 102(b)).

(b) Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts under section 102(a)(2) of the Act, the Secretary shall:

(1) State any objections to the contract proposal (as submitted by the Indian tribe or tribal organization) in writing and provide all documents relied on in making the declination decision within 20 days of such decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

(2) Provide assistance to the Indian tribe or tribal organization to overcome the stated objections;

(3) Provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under the regulations set forth in subpart L, except that the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing the appeal, initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly under section 110(a) of the Act.

##### § 900.124 May the Indian tribe or tribal organization elect to use a grant in lieu of a contract?

Yes. A grant agreement or a cooperative agreement may be used in lieu of a contract under sections 102 and 103 of the Act when agreed to by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Under the grant concept, the grantee will assume full responsibility and accountability for design and construction performance within the funding limitations. The grantee will manage and administer the work with minimal involvement by the government. The grantee will be expected to have acceptable management systems for finance, procurement, and property. The Secretary may issue Federal construction guidelines and manuals applicable to its construction programs, and the government shall accept tribal proposals for alternatives which are consistent with or exceed Federal guidelines or manuals applicable to construction programs.

##### § 900.125 What shall a construction contract proposal contain?

(a) In addition to the full name, address, and telephone number of the Indian tribe or tribal organization submitting the construction proposal, a construction contract proposal shall contain descriptions of the following standards under which they propose to operate the contract:

The parties will make a good faith effort to identify tribal laws, ordinances, and resolutions which may affect either party in the performance of the contract.

##### § 900.126 Shall a construction contract proposal incorporate provisions of Federal construction guidelines and manuals?

Each agency may provide or the Indian tribe or tribal organization may request Federal construction guidelines and manuals for consideration by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in the preparation of its contract proposal. If tribal construction procedures, standards and methods (including national, regional, State, or tribal building codes or construction industry standards) are consistent with or exceed applicable Federal standards, the Secretary shall accept the tribally proposed standards.

##### § 900.127 What can be included in the Indian tribe or tribal organization's contract budget?

(a) The costs incurred will vary depending on which phase (see § 900.112) of the construction process the Indian tribe or tribal organization is conducting and the type of contract that will be used. The total amount awarded under a construction contract shall reflect an overall fair and reasonable price to the parties (see § 900.129).

(b) Costs for activities under this subpart that have not been billed, allocated, or recovered under a contract issued under section 108 of the Act should be included.

(c) The Indian tribe or tribal organization's budget should include the cost elements that reflect an overall fair and reasonable price. These costs include:

(1) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization of performing the contract, taking into consideration the terms of the contract and the requirements of the Act and any other applicable law;

(2) The costs of preparing the contract proposal and supporting cost data;

(3) The costs associated with auditing the general and administrative costs of the Indian tribe or tribal organization associated with the management of the construction contract; and

(4) In cases where the Indian tribe or tribal organization is submitting a fixed-price construction contract:

(i) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization for general administration incurred in connection with the project that is the subject of the contract;

In the event provision of required contingency funds will cause the project to exceed available project funds, the discrepancy shall be reconciled in accordance with § 900.129(e). Any additional contingency funds for the construction phase will be negotiated on an as-needed basis subject to the availability of funds and the nature, scope, and complexity of the project. Any contingency for other phases will be negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Unused contingency funds obligated to the contract and remaining at the end of the contract will be considered savings.

(9) Other costs incurred that are directly related to the conduct of contract activities.

##### § 900.128 What funding shall the Secretary provide in a construction contract?

The Secretary shall provide an amount under a construction contract that reflects an overall fair and reasonable price to the parties. These costs include:

(a) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization of performing the contract, taking into consideration the terms of the contract and the requirements of the Act and any other applicable law;

(b) The costs of preparing the contract proposal and supporting cost data; and

(c) The costs associated with auditing the general and administrative costs of the tribal organization associated with the management of the construction contract; and

(d) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization is submitting a fixed-price construction contract:

(1) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization for general administration incurred in connection with the project that is the subject of the contract;

(2) The ability of the contractor that carries out the construction contract to make a reasonable profit, taking into consideration the risks associated with carrying out the contract, local market conditions, and other relevant considerations including but not limited to contingency.

(3) In establishing a contract budget for a construction project, the Secretary is not required to identify separately the components described in paragraph (d) (1) and (d) (2) of this sections.

##### § 900.129 How do the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization arrive at an overall fair and reasonable price for the performance of a construction contract?

(a) Throughout the contract award process, the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization shall share all construction project cost information available to them in order to facilitate reaching agreement on an overall fair and reasonable price for the project or part thereof. In order to enhance this communication, the government's estimate of an overall fair and reasonable price shall:

(1) Contain a level of detail appropriate to the nature and phase of the work and sufficient to allow comparisons to the Indian tribe or tribal organization's estimate;

(2) Be prepared in a format coordinated with the Indian tribe or tribal organization; and

(3) Include the cost elements contained in section 105(m)(4) of the Act.

(b) The government's cost estimate shall be an independent cost estimate based on such information as the following:

(1) Prior costs to the government for similar projects adjusted for comparison to the target location, typically in unit costs, such as dollars per pound, square meter cost of building, or other unit cost that can be used to make a comparison;

(2) Actual costs previously incurred by the Indian tribe or tribal organization for similar projects;

(3) Published price lists, to include regional adjustment factors, for materials, equipment, and labor; and

(4) Projections of inflation and cost trends, including projected changes such as labor, material, and transportation costs.

(c) The Secretary shall provide the initial government cost estimate to the Indian tribe or tribal organization and make appropriate revisions based on concerns raised or information provided by the Indian tribe or tribal organization. The Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall continue to revise, as appropriate, their respective cost estimates based on changed or additional information such as the following:

(1) Actual subcontract bids;

(2) Changes in inflation rates and market conditions, including local market conditions;

(3) Cost and price analyses conducted by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization during negotiations;

(4) Agreed-upon changes in the size, scope and schedule of the construction project; and

(5) Agreed-upon changes in project plans and specifications.

(d) Considering all of the information available, the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall negotiate the amount of the construction contract. The objective of the negotiations is to arrive at an amount that is fair under current market conditions and reasonable to both the government and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. As a result, the agreement does not necessarily have to be in strict conformance with either party's cost estimate nor does agreement have to be reached on every element of cost, but only on the overall fair and reasonable price of each phase of the work included in the contract.

(e) If the fair and reasonable price arrived at under paragraph (d) of this section would exceed the amount available to the Secretary, then:

(1) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to submit a final proposal, the Secretary may decline the proposal under section 105(m)(4)(C)(v) of the Act or if the contract has been awarded, dispute the matter under the Contract Disputes Act; or

(2) If requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization:

(i) The Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary may jointly explore methods of expanding the available funds through the use of contingency funds, advance payments in accordance with § 900.132, rebudgeting, or seeking additional appropriations; or

(ii) The Indian tribe or tribal organization may elect to propose a reduction in project scope to bring the project price within available funds; or

(iii) The Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization may agree that the project be executed in phases.

##### § 900.133 Does the declination process or the Contract Dispute Act apply to construction contract amendments proposed either by an Indian tribe or tribal organization or the Secretary?

The Contract Disputes Act generally applies to such amendments. However, the declination process and the procedures in §§ 900.122 and 900.123 apply to the proposal by an Indian tribe or tribal organization when the proposal is for a new project, a new phase or discreet stage of a phase of a project, or an expansion of a project resulting from an additional allocation of funds by the Secretary under § 900.120.

##### § 900.134 At the end of a self-determination construction contract, what happens to savings on a cost-reimbursement contract?

The savings shall be used by the Indian tribe or tribal organization to provide additional services or benefits under the contract.

##### § 900.148 How can an Indian tribe or tribal organization secure a determination that a law or regulation has been superseded by the Indian Self-Determination Act, as specified in section 107(b) of the Act?

Any Indian tribe or tribal organization may at any time submit a request to the Secretary for a determination that any law or regulation has been superseded by the Act and that the law has no applicability to any contract or proposed contract under the Act. The Secretary is required to provide an initial decision on such a request within 90 days after receipt. If such a request is denied, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may appeal under subpart L of these regulations.

The only exceptions are Indian contractors such as those under subcontract with the California Rural Indian Health Board to carry out IHS programs in geographically defined service areas in California and personal services contracts under § 900.193 (for § 900.183(b)(1)) or § 900.183(b) (for § 900.190).

#### Subpart N - Post-Award Contract Disputes

##### § 900.215 What does this subpart cover?

(a) This subpart covers:

(1) All HHS and DOI self-determination contracts, including construction contracts; and

(2) All disputes regarding an awarding official's decision relating to a self-determination contract.

(b) This subpart does not cover the decisions of an awarding official that are covered under subpart L.

##### § 900.216 What other statutes and regulations apply to contract disputes?

(a) The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), Public Law 95&#x2013;563 (41 U.S.C. 601 as amended);

##### § 900.217 Is filing a claim under the CDA our only option for resolving post-award contract disputes?

No. The Federal government attempts to resolve all contract disputes by agreement at the awarding official's level. These are alternatives to filing a claim under the CDA:

(a) Before issuing a decision on a claim, the awarding official should consider using informal discussions between the parties, assisted by individuals who have not substantially participated in the matter, to aid in resolving differences.

(b) In addition to filing a CDA claim, or instead of filing a CDA claim, the parties may choose to use an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, Public Law 101&#x2013;552, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 581or the options listed in section 108(1)(b)(12) of the Indian Self-Determination Act, as applicable.

##### § 900.218 What is a claim under the CDA?

(a) A claim is a written demand by one of the contracting parties, asking for one or more of the following:

(1) Payment of a specific sum of money under the contract;

(2) Adjustment or interpretation of contract terms; or

(3) Any other claim relating to the contract.

(b) However, an undisputed voucher, invoice, or other routing request for payment is not a claim under the CDA. A voucher, invoice, or routing request for payment may be converted into a CDA claim if:

(1) It is disputed as to liability or amount; or

(2) It is not acted upon in a reasonable time and written notice of the claim is given to the awarding official by the senior official designated in the contract.

##### § 900.219 How does an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Federal agency submit a claim?

(a) An Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit its claim in writing to the awarding official. The awarding official shall document the contract file with evidence of the date the claim was received.

(b) A Federal agency shall submit its claim in writing to the contractor's senior official, as designated in the contract.

##### § 900.220 Does it make a difference whether the claim is large or small?

Yes. The Contract Disputes Act requires that an Indian tribe or tribal organization making a claim for more than $100,000 shall certify that:

(a) The claim is made in good faith,

(b) Supporting documents or data are accurate and complete to the best of the Indian tribe or tribal organization's knowledge and belief;

(c) The amount claimed accurately reflects the amount believed to be owed by the Federal government; and

(d) The person making the certification is authorized to do so on behalf of the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

##### § 900.221 What happens next?

(a) If the parties do not agree on a settlement, the awarding official will issue a written decision on the claim.

(b) The awarding official shall always give a copy of the decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other method which provides a receipt.

##### § 900.222 What goes into a decision?

A decision shall:

(a) Describe the claim or dispute;

(b) Refer to the relevant terms of the contract;

(c) Set out the factual areas of agreement and disagreement;

(d) Set out the actual decision, based on the facts, and outline the reasoning which supports the decision; and

(e) Contain the following language:

##### § 900.223 When does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get the decision?

(a) If the claim is for more than $100,000, the awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives the claim. If the awarding official cannot issue a decision that quickly, he or she shall tell you when the decision will be issued.

(b) If the claim is for $100,000 or less, and you want a decision within 60 days, you shall advise the awarding official in writing that you want a decision within that period. If you advise the awarding official in writing that you do want a decision within 60 days, the awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives your written notice.

(c) If your claim is for $100,000 or less and you do not advise the awarding official that you want a decision within 60 days, or if your claim exceeds $100,000 and the awarding official has notified you of the time within which a decision will be issued, the awarding official shall issue a decision within a reasonable time. What is “reasonable” depends upon the size and complexity of your claim, and upon the adequacy of the information you have given to the awarding official in support of your claim.

##### § 900.224 What happens if the decision does not come within that time?

If the awarding official does not issue a decision within the time required under § 900.223, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may treat the delay as though the awarding official has denied the claim, and proceed according to § 900.222(e),

##### § 900.225 Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get paid immediately if the awarding official decides in its favor?

Yes. Once the awarding official decides that money should be paid under the contract, the amount due, minus any portion already paid, should be paid as promptly as possible, without waiting for either party to file an appeal. Any payment which is made under this subsection will not affect any other rights either party might have. In addition, it will not create a binding legal precedent as to any future payments.

##### § 900.226 What rules govern appeals of cost disallowances?

In any appeal involving a disallowance of costs, the Board of Contract Appeals will give due consideration to the factual circumstances giving rise to the disallowed costs, and shall seek to determine a fair result without rigid adherence to strict accounting principles. The determination of allowability shall assure fair compensation for the work or service performed, using cost and accounting data as guides, but not rigid measures, for ascertaining fair compensation.

##### § 900.227 Can the awarding official change the decision after it has been made?

(a) The decision of the awarding official is final and conclusive, and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal or government agency, unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced as authorized by the Contract Disputes Act. Once the decision has been made, the awarding official may not change it, except by agreement of the parties, or under the following limited circumstances:

(1) If evidence is discovered which could not have been discovered through due diligence before the awarding official issued the decision;

(2) If the awarding official learns that there has been fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct by a party;

(3) If the decision is beyond the scope of the awarding official's authority;

(4) If the claim has been satisfied, released or discharged; or

(5) For any other reason justifying relief from the decision.

(b) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to discourage settlement discussions or prevent settlement of the dispute at any time.

(c) If a decision is withdrawn and a new decision is issued that is not acceptable to the contractor, the contractor may proceed with the appeal based on the new decision. If no new decision is issued, the contractor may proceed under § 900.224.

(d) If an appeal or suit is filed, the awarding official may modify or withdraw his or her final decision.

##### § 900.228 Is an Indian tribe or tribal organization entitled to interest if it wins its claim?

Yes. If an Indian tribe or tribal organization wins the claim, it will be entitled to interest on the amount of the award. The interest will be calculated from the date the awarding official receives the claim until the day it is paid. The interest rate will be the rate which the Secretary of the Treasury sets for the Renegotiation Board under the Renegotiation Act of 1951, Public Law 92&#x2013;41, 26 U.S.C. 1212 and 26 U.S.C. 7447.

##### § 900.229 What role will the awarding official play during an appeal?

(a) The awarding official shall provide any data, documentation, information or support required by the CBCA for use in deciding a pending appeal.

(b) Within 30 days of receiving an appeal or learning that an appeal has been filed, the awarding official shall assemble a file which contains all the documents which are pertinent to the appeal, including:

(1) The decision and findings of fact from which the appeal is taken;

(2) The contract, including specifications and pertinent modifications, plans and drawings;

(3) All correspondence between the parties which relates to the appeal, including the letter or letters of claims in response to which the decision was issued;

(4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of the proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter in dispute, which were made before the filing of the notice of appeal with the CBCA; and

(5) Any additional information which may be relevant.

##### § 900.230 What is the effect of a pending appeal?

(a) Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall continue performance of a contract during the appeal of any claims to the same extent they would had there been no dispute.

(b) A pending dispute will not affect or bar the negotiation or award of any subsequent contract or negotiation between the parties.

#### Subpart O - Conflicts of Interest

##### § 900.231 What is an organizational conflict of interest?

An organizational conflict of interest arises when there is a direct conflict between the financial interests of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization and:

(a) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust resources;

(b) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S.C. 1601or

(c) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the contract was first negotiated. This section only applies where the financial interests of the Indian tribe or tribal organization are significant enough to impair the Indian tribe or tribal organization's objectivity in carrying out the contract, or a portion of the contract.

##### § 900.232 What must an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under a contract?

This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the contract was first negotiated. When an Indian tribe or tribal organization becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, the Indian tribe or tribal organization must immediately disclose the conflict to the Secretary.

##### § 900.233 When must an Indian tribe or tribal organization regulate its employees or subcontractors to avoid a personal conflict of interest?

An Indian tribe or tribal organization must maintain written standards of conduct to govern officers, employees, and agents (including subcontractors) engaged in functions related to the management of trust assets.

##### § 900.234 What types of personal conflicts of interest involving tribal officers, employees or subcontractors would have to be regulated by an Indian tribe?

The Indian tribe or tribal organization would need a tribally-approved mechanism to ensure that no officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) of the Indian tribe or tribal organization reviews a trust transaction in which that person has a financial or employment interest that conflicts with that of the trust beneficiary, whether the tribe or an allottee. Interests arising from membership in, or employment by, an Indian tribe or rights to share in a tribal claim need not be regulated.

##### § 900.235 What personal conflicts of interest must the standards of conduct regulate?

The standards must prohibit an officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) from participating in the review, analysis, or inspection of trust transactions involving an entity in which such persons have a direct financial interest or an employment relationship. It must also prohibit such officers, employees, or agents from accepting any gratuity, favor, or anything of more than nominal value, from a party (other than the Indian tribe) with an interest in the trust transactions under review. Such standards must also provide for sanctions or remedies for violation of the standards.

##### § 900.236 May an Indian tribe elect to negotiate contract provisions on conflict of interest to take the place of this regulation?

Yes. An Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree to contract provisions, concerning either personal or organizational conflicts, that address the issues specific to the program and activities contracted in a manner that provides equivalent protection against conflicts of interest to these regulations. Agreed-upon contract provisions shall be followed, rather than the related provisions of this regulation. For example, the Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree that using the Indian tribe's own written code of ethics satisfies the objectives of the personal conflicts provisions of this regulation, in whole or in part.

#### Subpart P - Retrocession and Reassumption Procedures

##### § 900.240 What does retrocession mean?

A retrocession means the return to the Secretary of a contracted program, in whole or in part, for any reason, before the expiration of the term of the contract.

##### § 900.241 Who may retrocede a contract, in whole or in part?

An Indian tribe or tribal organization authorized by an Indian tribe may retrocede a contract.

An Indian tribe or tribal organization's retrocession shall not negatively affect:

(a) Any other contract to which it is a party;

(b) Any other contracts it may request; and

(c) Any future request by the Indian tribe or tribal organization to contract for the same program.

##### § 900.244 Will an Indian tribe or tribal organization's retrocession adversely affect funding available for the retroceded program?

No. The Secretary shall provide not less than the same level of funding that would have been available if there had been no retrocession.

##### § 900.245 What obligation does the Indian tribe or tribal organization have with respect to returning property that was used in the operation of the retroceded program?

On the effective date of any retrocession, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall, at the request of the Secretary, deliver to the Secretary all requested property and equipment provided under the contract which have a per item current fair market value, less the cost of improvements borne by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, in excess of $5,000 at the time of the retrocession.

##### § 900.246 What does reassumption mean?

Reassumption means rescission, in whole or in part, of a contract and assuming or resuming control or operation of the contracted program by the Secretary without consent of the Indian tribe or tribal organization. There are two types of reassumption: emergency and non-emergency.

##### § 900.247 Under what circumstances is a reassumption considered an emergency instead of non-emergency reassumption?

(a) A reassumption is considered an emergency reassumption if an Indian tribe or tribal organization fails to fulfill the requirements of the contract and this failure poses:

(1) An immediate threat of imminent harm to the safety of any person; or

(2) Imminent substantial and irreparable harm to trust funds, trust lands, or interest in such lands.

(b) A reassumption is considered a non-emergency reassumption if there has been:

(2) Gross negligence or mismanagement in the handling or use of:

(i) Contract funds;

(ii) Trust funds;

(iii) Trust lands; or

(iv) Interests in trust lands under the contract.

##### § 900.248 In a non-emergency reassumption, what is the Secretary required to do?

The Secretary must:

(a) Notify the Indian tribes or tribal organizations served by the contract and the contractor in writing by certified mail of the details of the deficiencies in contract performance;

(b) Request specified corrective action to be taken within a reasonable period of time, which in no case may be less than 45 days; and

(c) Offer and provide, if requested, the necessary technical assistance and advice to assist the contractor to overcome the deficiencies in contract performance. The Secretary may also make a grant for the purpose of obtaining such technical assistance as provided in section 103 of the Act.

##### § 900.249 What happens if the contractor fails to take corrective action to remedy the contract deficiencies identified in the notice?

The Secretary shall provide a second written notice by certified mail to the Indian tribes or tribal organizations served by the contract and the contractor that the contract will be rescinded, in whole or in part.

(a) Immediately rescind, in whole or in part, the contract;

(b) Assume control or operation of all or part of the program; and

(c) Give written notice to the contractor and the Indian tribes or tribal organizations served.

##### § 900.253 What shall the written notice include?

The written notice shall include the following:

(a) A detailed statement of the findings which support the Secretary's determination;

(b) A statement explaining the contractor's right to a hearing on the record under § 900.171 within 10 days of the emergency reassumption or such later date as the contractor may approve;

(c) An explanation that the contractor may be reimbursed for actual and reasonable “wind up costs” incurred after the effective date of the rescission; and

(d) A request for the return of property, if any.

##### § 900.254 May the contractor be reimbursed for actual and reasonable “wind up costs” incurred after the effective date of rescission?

Yes.

##### § 900.255 What obligation does the Indian tribe or tribal organization have with respect to returning property that was used in the operation of the rescinded contract?

On the effective date of any rescission, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall, at the request of the Secretary, deliver to the Secretary all property and equipment provided under the contract which has a per item current fair market value, less the cost of improvements borne by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, in excess of $5,000 at the time of the retrocession.

(b)The information provided by the Tribes will be used by the Department for a variety of purposes. The first purpose will be to ensure that qualified applicants are admitted into the applicant pool consistent with the requirements of the Act. In addition, Tribes seeking grant assistance to meet the planning requirements for admission into the applicant pool, will provide information so that grants can be awarded to Tribes meeting basic eligibility (Tribal resolution indicating that the Tribe wants to plan for Self-Governance and has no material audit exceptions for the last three years of audits).

##### § 1000.4 Policy statement.

(a)In the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, the Congress found that:

(1) The Tribal right of self-governance flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and nations;

(2) The United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes, including the right of the Tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian Tribes;

(3) Although progress had been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, had eroded Tribal self-governance and dominated Tribal affairs;

(4) The Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States and to strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and

(5) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance demonstration project and finds that:

(i) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon Tribal request, for Federal programs is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes; and

(ii) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon request, for Federal programs strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.

(b)It is the policy of the Tribal Self-Governance Act to permanently establish and implement self-governance:

(1) To enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;

(2) To permit each Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance;

(3) To coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;

(4) To ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indian individuals;

(5) To permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities; and

(6) To provide for an orderly transition through a planned and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.

(c)(1) It is the policy of the Secretary to fully support and implement the foregoing policies to the full extent of the Secretary's authority.

(2) It is the policy of the Secretary to recognize and respect the unique government-to-government relationship between Tribes, as sovereign governments, and the United States.

(3) It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department work cooperatively and pro-actively with Tribes and Tribal Consortia on a government-to-government basis within the framework of the Act and any other applicable provision of law, so as to make the ideals of self-determination and self-governance a reality.

(4) It is the policy of the Secretary to have all bureaus of the Department actively share information with Tribes and Tribal Consortia to encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to become knowledgeable about the Department's programs and the opportunities to include them in an annual funding agreement.

(5) It is the policy of the Secretary that all bureaus of the Department will negotiate in good faith, interpret each applicable Federal law and regulation in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of programs in each annual funding agreement authorized, and enter into such annual funding agreements under Title IV, whenever possible.

(6) It is the policy of the Secretary to afford Tribes and Tribal Consortia the maximum flexibility and discretion necessary to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious, and institutional needs. These policies are designed to facilitate and encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs, included, or eligible for inclusion in an annual funding agreement.

(7) It is the policy of the Secretary, to the extent of the Secretary's authority, to maintain active communication with Tribal governments regarding budgetary matters applicable to programs subject to the Act, and that are included in an individual self-governance annual funding agreement.

(8) It is the policy of the Secretary to implement policies, procedures, and practices at the Department to ensure that the letter, spirit, and goals of the Tribal Self-Governance Act are fully and successfully implemented.

(9) Executive Order 13084 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and any subsequent Executive Orders regarding consultation will apply to the implementation of these regulations.

#### Subpart N - Retrocession

##### § 1000.330 What is the purpose of this subpart?

This subpart explains what happens when a Tribe/Consortium voluntarily returns a program to a bureau.

##### § 1000.331 Is a decision by a Tribe/Consortium not to include a program in a successor agreement considered a retrocession?

No, a decision by a Tribe/Consortium not to include a program in a successor agreement is not a retrocession because the Tribe/Consortium is under no obligation beyond an existing AFA.

##### § 1000.332 Who may retrocede a program in an AFA?

A Tribe/Consortium may retrocede a program. However, the right of a Consortium member to retrocede may be subject to the terms of the agreement among the members of the Consortium.

(b) A Tribal resolution or other official action of its governing body.

##### § 1000.334 When will the retrocession become effective?

Unless subsequently rescinded by the Tribe/Consortium, a retrocession is only effective on a date mutually agreed upon by the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary, or as provided in the AFA.

##### § 1000.335 How will retrocession affect the Tribe's/Consortium's existing and future AFAs?

##### § 1000.338 What happens to a Tribe's/Consortium's mature contract status if it has retroceded a program that is also available for self-determination contracting?

Retrocession has no effect on mature contract status, provided that the 3 most recent audits covering activities administered by the Tribe have no unresolved material audit exceptions.

##### § 1000.339 How does retrocession affect a bureau's operation of the retroceded program?

The level of operation of the program will depend upon the amount of funding that is returned with the retrocession.

#### Subpart O - Trust Evaluation Review

##### § 1000.350 What is the purpose of this subpart?

This subpart describes how the trust responsibility of the United States is legally maintained through a system of trust evaluations when Tribes/Consortia perform trust functions through AFAs under the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994. It describes the principles and processes upon which trust evaluations will be based.

##### § 1000.351 Does the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 alter the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and individuals under self-governance?

No, the Act does, however, permit a Tribe/Consortium to assume management responsibilities for trust assets and resources on its own behalf and on behalf of individual Indians. Under the Act, the Secretary has a trust responsibility to conduct annual trust evaluations of Tribal performance of trust functions to ensure that Tribal and individual trust assets and resources are managed in accordance with the legal principles and standards governing the performance of trust functions if trust assets or resources are found to be in imminent jeopardy.

##### § 1000.352 What are “trust resources” for the purposes of the trust evaluation process?

(a) Trust resources include property and interests in property:

(1) That are held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a Tribe or individual Indians; or

(2) That are subject to restrictions upon alienation.

(b) Trust assets include:

(1) Other assets, trust revenue, royalties, or rental, including natural resources, land, water, minerals, funds, property, assets, or claims, and any intangible right or interest in any of the foregoing;

(2) Any other property, asset, or interest therein, or treaty right for which the United States is charged with a trust responsibility. For example, water rights and off-reservation treaty rights.

(c) This definition defines trust resources for purposes of the trust evaluation process only.

##### § 1000.353 What are “trust functions” for the purposes of the trust evaluation process?

Trust functions are those programs necessary to the management of assets held in trust by the United States for an Indian Tribe or individual Indian.

Annually, the Secretary will compile a report on self-governance for submission to the Congress. The report will be based on:

(a) Audit reports routinely submitted by Tribes/Consortia;

(b) The number of retrocessions requested by Tribes/Consortia in the reporting year;

(c) The number of reassumptions that occurred in the reporting year;

(d) Federal reductions-in-force and reorganizations resulting from self-governance activity;

(e) The type of residual functions and amount of residual funding retained by BIA; and

(f) An annual report submitted to the Secretary by each Tribe/Consortium as described in

##### § 1000.382 What may the Tribe's/Consortium's annual report on self-governance address?

(a) The Tribe's/Consortium's annual self-governance report may address:

(1) A list of unmet Tribal needs in order of priority;

#### Subpart R - Appeals

##### § 1000.420 What does “Title-I eligible programs” mean in this subpart?

Throughout this subpart, the phrase “Title I-eligible programs” is used to refer to all programs, functions, services, and activities that the Secretary provides for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians without regard to the agency or office of the Department within which the programs, functions, services, and activities have been performed.

##### § 1000.421 What is the purpose of this subpart?

This subpart prescribes the process Tribes/Consortia may use to resolve disputes with the Department arising before or after execution of an AFA or compact and certain other disputes related to self-governance. It also describes the administrative process for reviewing disputes related to compact provisions. This subpart describes the process for administrative appeals to:

(a) The Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) for certain pre-AFA disputes;

(b) The term “Tribe” means “Tribe/Consortium'.

##### § 1000.430 Who handles appeals regarding reassumption for imminent jeopardy?

Appeals regarding reassumption of Title I-eligible PFSAs are handled by the IBIA under the procedures in 25 CFR 900.171 through 900.176. Appeals regarding reassumption of PFSAs that are not Title I-eligible are handled by the CBCA under the procedures in 48 CFR part 6101.

##### § 1000.431 Does the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) apply to appeals under this subpart?

Yes. EAJA claims against the DOI will be heard under 48 CFR 6101.30, 6101.31 (CBCA) and 43 CFR 4.602, 4.604 through 4.628 (DOI) and under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 and 28 U.S.C. 2412.

##### § 1000.432 To whom may a Tribe appeal a decision made before the AFA or an amendment to the AFA or compact is signed?

(a)For Title I&#x2014;eligible PFSA disputes, appeal may only be filed with IBIA under the provisions set forth in 25 CFR 900.150(a) through (h), 900.152 through 900.169.

(b)For all other pre-award disputes, including those involving PFSAs that are not Title I-eligible, appeals may be filed with the bureau head/Assistant Secretary or IBIA as noted below. However, the Tribe/Consortium may not avail itself of both paths for the same dispute.

(1)Unless the initial decision being appealed is one that was made by the bureau head (those appeals are forwarded to the appropriate Assistant Secretary&#x2014;see § 1000.433(c) of this subpart), the bureau head will decide appeals relating to these pre-award matters, that include but are not limited to disputes regarding:

(i) PFSAs that are not Title 1-eligible;

(ii) Eligibility for the applicant pool of self-governance Tribes;

(iii) BIA residual functions;

(iv) Decisions declining to provide requested information as addressed in § 1000.172 of this part;

(v) Allocations of program funds when a dispute arises between a Consortium and a withdrawing Tribe; and

(vi) Inherently Federal functions.

(2)The Tribe/Consortium may choose to forego the administrative appeal through the bureau or the Assistant Secretary, as described in the paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and instead appeal directly to IBIA. The standard of review for such IBIA appeals will be an “abuse of discretion” standard.

##### § 1000.433 When and how must a Tribe/Consortium appeal an adverse pre-award decision?

(a) If a Tribe/Consortium wishes to exercise its appeal rights under § 1000.432(b)(1), it must make a written request for review to the appropriate bureau head within 30 days of receiving the initial adverse decision. In addition, the Tribe/Consortium may request the opportunity to have a meeting with appropriate bureau personnel in an effort to clarify the matter under dispute before a formal decision by the bureau head.

(b) The written request for review should include a statement describing its reasons for a review, with any supporting documentation, or indicate that such a statement or documentation will be submitted within 30 days. A copy of the request must also be sent to the Director of the Office of Self-Governance.

(c) If the initial decision was made by the bureau head, any appeal shall be directed to the appropriate Assistant Secretary. If a Tribe does not request a review within 30 days of receipt of the decision, the initial decision will be final for the Department.

##### § 1000.434 When must the bureau head (or appropriate Assistant Secretary) issue a final decision in the pre-award appeal?

Within 30 days of receiving the request for review and the statement of reasons described in § 1000.433, the bureau head or, where applicable, the appropriate Assistant Secretary must:

(a) Issue a written final decision stating the reasons for the decision; and

(b) Send the decision to the Tribe/Consortium.

##### § 1000.435 When and how will the Assistant Secretary respond to an appeal by a Tribe/Consortium?

The appropriate Assistant Secretary will decide an appeal of any initial decision made by a bureau head (see § 1000.433). If the Tribe/Consortium has appealed the bureau's initial adverse decision of the bureau to the bureau head and the bureau head's decision on initial appeal is contrary to the Tribe's/Consortium's request for relief, or the bureau head fails to make a decision within 30 days of receipt by the bureau of the Tribe's/Consortium's initial request for review and any accompanying statement and documentation, the Tribe's/Consortium's appeal will be sent automatically to the appropriate Assistant Secretary for decision. The Assistant Secretary must either concur with the bureau head's decision or issue a separate decision within 60 days of receipt by the bureau of the Tribe's/Consortium's initial request for review and any accompanying statement and documentation.

#### Subpart S - Conflicts of Interest

##### § 1000.460 What is an organizational conflict of interest?

(a) An organizational conflict of interest arises when there is a direct conflict between the financial interests of the self-governance Tribe/Consortium and:

(1) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust resources;

(2) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S. C. 1601or

(3) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the AFA was first negotiated.

(b) This section only applies where the financial interests of the Tribe/Consortium are significant enough to impair the Tribe's/Consortium's objectivity in carrying out the AFA, or a portion of the AFA.

##### § 1000.461 What must a Tribe/Consortium do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under an AFA?

This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the AFA was first negotiated. When a Tribe/Consortium becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, the Tribe/Consortium must immediately disclose the conflict to the Secretary.

##### § 1000.462 When must a Tribe/Consortium regulate its employees or subcontractors to avoid a personal conflict of interest?

A Tribe/Consortium must maintain written standards of conduct to govern officers, employees, and agents (including subcontractors) engaged in functions related to the management of trust assets.

##### § 1000.463 What types of personal conflicts of interest involving tribal officers, employees or subcontractors would have to be regulated by a Tribe/Consortium?

The Tribe/Consortium would need a tribally-approved mechanism to ensure that no officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) of the Tribe/Consortium reviews a trust transaction in which that person has a financial or employment interest that conflicts with that of the trust beneficiary, whether the tribe/consortium or an allottee. Interests arising from membership in, or employment by, a Tribe/Consortium or rights to share in a tribal claim need not be regulated.

##### § 1000.464 What personal conflicts of interest must the standards of conduct regulate?

The personal conflicts of interest standards must:

(a) Prohibit an officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) from participating in the review, analysis, or inspection of trust transactions involving an entity in which such persons have a direct financial interest or an employment relationship;

(b) Prohibit such officers, employees, or agents from accepting any gratuity, favor, or anything of more than nominal value, from a party (other than the Tribe/Consortium) with an in the trust transactions under review; and

(c) Provide for sanctions or remedies for violation of the standards.

##### § 1000.465 May a Tribe/Consortium negotiate AFA provisions on conflicts of interest to take the place of this subpart?

(a) A Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may agree to AFA provisions, concerning either personal or organizational conflicts, that:

(1) Address the issues specific to the program and activities contracted; and

(2) Provide equivalent protection against conflicts of interest to these regulations.

(b) Agreed-upon AFA provisions shall be followed, rather than the related provisions of this subpart. For example, the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may agree that using the Tribe's/Consortium's own written code of ethics satisfies the objectives of the personal conflicts provisions of subpart, in whole or in part.

## Chapter VII - Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Department of the Interior

### PART 1200 - AMERICAN INDIAN TRUST FUND MANAGEMENT REFORM ACT

#### Subpart A - General Provisions

##### § 1200.1 Purpose of this regulation.

This part describes the processes by which Indian tribes can manage tribal funds currently held in trust by the United States. It defines how tribes may withdraw their funds from trust status; how they may return funds to trust; and how they may request technical assistance or grants to help prepare plans to manage funds or to ensure the capability to manage those funds.

##### § 1200.2 Definitions.

As used in this part:

means the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&#x2013;412, 108 Stat. 4239, 25 U.S.C. 4001).

means the official in charge of a Bureau of Indian Affairs Agency.

ormeans the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior.

ormeans the Department of the Interior.

means the designated OST official at the agency or regional office.

means the attorney for the tribe.

means the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Department of the Interior.

means the Bureau of Indian Affairs official in charge of a Regional Office.

means the formal manner in which a tribal government expresses its legislative will.

means the Secretary of the Interior or his/her designee.

means the Office of the Solicitor, Department of the Interior.

means the Special Trustee for American Indians appointed under title III of the Act.

means the elected or appointed governing officials of any tribe which is recognized by the Secretary.

means any Indian tribe, band, nation, rancheria, pueblo, colony or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which is federally recognized by the U.S. Government for special programs and services provided by the Secretary to Indians because of their status as Indians. For this purpose, it also means two or more tribes joined for any purpose, the joint assets of which include funds held in trust by the Secretary. An example of this would be the KCA (consisting of the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes).

means the Department of the Interior, i.e., the Secretary of the Interior or his/her designee.

means the Department of the Interior, i.e., the Secretary of the Interior or his/her designee.

##### § 1200.3 What is the Department's policy on tribal management of trust funds?

(a) We will give tribes as much responsibility as they desire for the management of their tribal funds that we currently hold in trust.

(b) Title II of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, implemented by these regulations, offers tribes one approach for assuming increased management of their funds that we now hold in trust and administer. Under title II, a tribe may completely remove its funds from Federal trust status and manage them as it wishes, subject to the requirements and conditions in this part. When a tribe withdraws its funds under this part, it may invest those funds in equities or other investment vehicles that are statutorily unavailable to us.

##### § 1200.4 May tribes exercise increased direction over their trust funds and retain the protections of Federal trust status?

Yes. The Tribal Self-Governance Act (25 U.S.C. 458) and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450) provide other options for trust funds management. A tribe may choose to manage its trust funds under the provisions of these Acts if it wishes. These options are covered by 25 CFR part 900 (the “Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act Program”) and 25 CFR part 1000 (the “Self-Governance Program”).

##### § 1200.5 What are the advantages and disadvantages of managing trust funds under the options in § 1200.4?

Under these other options, the funds remain in Federal trust status and the tribe can exercise a range of control over their management. However, the tribe has fewer investment options than it has when it withdraws its funds completely from trust status. If a tribe chooses to keep its funds in trust status, the tribe is subject to the same statutory investment restrictions that bind us. That means that the tribe's investments are limited to bank deposits and securities guaranteed by the United States. (See 25 U.S.C. 162a for specific statutory investment restrictions.)

##### § 1200.6 How could a tribe receive future income directly rather than have the government continue to collect it?

If a tribe wishes to receive future income directly, the tribe may contact a Fiduciary Trust Officer located at the agency or regional office.

##### § 1200.7 Information collection.

(a) The information collection requirements contained in subpart B of this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507and assigned OMB Control Number 1035&#x2013;0003. Information is also collected in subpart D through the use of the following standard forms:

(1) SF 424, Application for Federal Assistance, OMB Control Number 0348&#x2013;0043; and

(2) SF 424A, Budget Information, OMB Control Number 0348&#x2013;0044.

(b) Information collected in § 1200.13 (How does a tribe apply to withdraw funds?) will be used to determine the eligibility of applicants, and the capability of tribes or their contractors to manage and invest large blocks of funds.

(c) Information collected in § 1200.43, (How can a tribe apply for technical assistance?) will be used to determine the eligibility of applicants, as well as the level of need for technical assistance, in order for tribes to develop Management Plans and to complete the application for withdrawal process.

#### Subpart B - Withdrawing Tribal Funds From Trust

##### § 1200.10 Who is eligible to withdraw their tribal funds from trust?

Any tribe for whom we manage funds in trust.

##### § 1200.11 What funds may be withdrawn?

A tribe may withdraw some or all funds that we hold in trust if we approve a plan that it submits under this part.

##### § 1200.12 What limitations and restrictions apply to withdrawn funds?

(a) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy judgments of the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) and the Court of Federal Claims and that we hold under the Indian Judgment Funds Use and Distributions Act (25 U.S.C. 1401) or another act of Congress if:

(1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved judgment fund plan, and;

(2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does not include any funds held for individual tribal members.

(b) A tribe may withdraw funds appropriated to satisfy settlement agreements relating to certain tribal claims and that we hold and manage for the tribe pursuant to an act of Congress if:

(1) The tribe uses the funds as specified in the previously approved settlement act plan;

(2) The tribe withdraws only funds held for Indian tribes and does not include any funds held for individual tribal members; and

(3) It is determined that there is no provision in the act or settlement agreement requiring that the funds remain in trust to implement the act or agreement that cannot be waived.

(c) Tribal funds commonly known as “Proceeds of Labor” funds, usually income to trust resources, are generally withdrawn under normal tribal budgeting procedures, but may also be withdrawn from trust under this part. These funds may be returned to trust under the provisions of subpart C of this part.

##### § 1200.13 How does a tribe apply to withdraw funds?

To withdraw funds, a tribe must submit four copies of its application and the attachments listed in this section to: Director, Office of External Affairs, Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Department of the Interior, MS&#x2013;5140, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. We will notify the tribe if the application is incomplete and will help the tribe complete the application if requested. When we determine that the application is complete, we will send copies to the appropriate agency superintendent and regional director, and to the Special Trustee and the Solicitor. Each application package must contain the items listed below.

(a) Proof that the tribe has notified its members of its intent to remove funds from trust and that, when the request is approved, the tribe and not the United States Government will be liable for funds management. Notification must be by the method(s) that the tribe customarily uses to notify its members of significant tribal actions. The notification must identify the specific funds to be withdrawn.

(b) A tribal resolution that:

(2) Transfer funds to the tribe or another manager only after receiving a valid tribal resolution calling for this transfer and proof that the tribe has notified its members of intent to transfer the funds. The resolution must clearly state that:

(i) The funds are being withdrawn to be reinvested by the tribe in a manner consistent with the goals and strategies of the approved plan; and

(ii) The fund managers will continue to follow any previously approved distribution plan conditions.

(d) A legal opinion by the tribe's attorney or its general counsel that:

(1) The resolution referred to in paragraph (b) of this section was enacted under procedures established by the tribe's organic documents or oral tradition;

(2) The tribal governing body has the legal authority to withdraw funds from trust status and that the withdrawal does not require a referendum vote or other procedure beyond a tribal council resolution; and

(l) A statement as to whether the tribe chooses to receive the withdrawal as a cash balance transfer, as a transfer of marketable investments that we own for the tribe, or as a combination of the two.

(1) A cash balance transfer may require us to sell bonds, notes, or other investments that we purchased when investing the tribe's monies.

(2) We cannot transfer non-marketable securities to a tribe. We can only purchase and hold them and must sell them back to the U.S. Treasury.

(3) If we sell a tribe's security at a loss (i.e., when market value is less than book value or carrying value) we will first notify the tribe. The tribe must instruct us to proceed with the sale and must agree not to hold us responsible for the loss before we will make the sale.

(4) If the tribe asks us to transfer marketable securities, upon proper instructions from the new tribal custodian, we will order our custodian to physically transfer the proper security to the new custodian on the agreed upon date.

(m) Agreement that judgment award funds will have segregated accounts.

(n) A description of the procedures for amending or revising the plan.

##### § 1200.15 What is the approval process for management plans?

The Secretary will approve or disapprove each management plan, based in part upon our recommendation.

(a) We will determine the completeness of the application, provide for adequate professional review of the application and the management plan, and provide technical assistance as necessary to make an application complete.

(b) We will coordinate with regional directors in confirming authority of tribal governments to make requests.

(c) We will approve or disapprove a request within 90 calendar days of receiving a completed application. This 90-day period does not include time that we spend awaiting a response from the tribe for additional information that we have requested. All determinations will be in writing, and all responses will be by certified mail.

(d) If we find that a plan does not meet the criteria in § 1200.16, we will notify the tribe of shortcomings of the request, and allow the tribe to respond before recommending formal disapproval.

(e) Before final approval, we will reach agreement with the tribe on how many days after final approval we will transfer the funds. We will transfer the funds as soon after final approval as the tribe or manager is ready to receive them, unless we need additional time to sell existing instruments.

##### § 1200.16 What criteria will be used in evaluating the management plan?

Each plan must be approved by the appropriate tribal governing body, and must be accompanied by a resolution approving the plan. The plan must be reasonable in light of the trust responsibility and the principles of Indian self-determination, and other appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, the factors listed below:

(a) We will evaluate the individuals or entities that will manage the funds to be withdrawn, or that will advise the tribe on investing the funds to be withdrawn in order to determine if they have the capability and experience to manage the funds. Among the elements we will evaluate are: the number of years in business, the performance record for funds management, and the ability to compensate the tribe if the entity is found liable for failing to comply with the tribe's management plan (i.e., its assets, bonding, and insurance).

(b) We will review the tribe's experience in managing investments. We will compare this experience to the complexity of the proposed management plan to determine whether the tribe has the experience to manage its proposed plan or whether it should begin with a less complex approach.

(c) We will evaluate the tribe's internal audit and control systems for overseeing or monitoring its investment activity.

(d) We will evaluate the adequacy of protection against substantial loss of principal. Our determination will include a thorough evaluation of the tribe's investment plan including:

(1) The goals and objectives;

(2) The proposed uses of the fund in order to meet business objectives;

(3) The size and diversity of the investment portfolio (for example, the class of stocks and the mixture of types of investments);

(4) The financial condition of the tribe;

(5) The inherent riskiness of the proposed investments; and

(6) The tribe's projected need and proposed timeframes to draw down the funds being invested or the income from them.

(e) We will determine the likelihood that the plan will be followed. We will base this determination on the contents of the agreement between the tribe and the fund manager and other appropriate factors.

##### § 1200.17 What special criteria will be used to evaluate management plans for judgment or settlement funds?

For judgment or settlement funds, in addition to the criteria in § 1200.16, we will determine if the plan adequately provides for compliance with any conditions, uses of funds, or other requirements established by the appropriate judgment fund plan or settlement act.

##### § 1200.18 When does the Department's trust responsibility end?

Our trust responsibility for funds withdrawn under this part ends on the date that the funds are withdrawn. However at the time of withdrawal neither we nor the tribe may be deemed to have accepted the account balance at the time of withdrawal as accurate; or waived any rights regarding the balance and our ability to seek compensation.

##### § 1200.19 How can the plan be revised?

Once a tribe has withdrawn its funds, the tribe may revise its plan without our approval. All revisions should conform to the procedures outlined in the approved management plan. The tribe should inform its members of all revisions to a plan through normal tribal procedures before the revisions are implemented.

##### § 1200.20 How can a tribe withdraw additional funds?

(a) If a tribe has withdrawn funds under an approved tribal management plan and wishes to withdraw additional funds that will be managed under the same plan, it need not submit a complete new application. The tribe must:

(1) Notify us of the additional amount it intends to withdraw and whether the funds to be withdrawn are in kind or cash. (Written notification should be provided to our address in § 1200.13);

(2) Send us a tribal resolution approving the new withdrawal and certifying that the funds are being withdrawn subject to the same conditions and that they will be managed under the plan in the original approved application;

(3) Send us a copy of the most recent compliance audit or investment report.

(b) After we finish our review we will release the additional funds, unless the compliance audit or investment report indicates that the tribe is not complying with its management plan. In this case, we will not release the additional funds until the tribe demonstrates that it is complying with the management plan.

##### § 1200.21 How may a tribe appeal denials under this part?

If we deny a request or do not approve an application within 90 days of a request, the tribe may address any problems that we identify and resubmit a revised request, seek technical assistance, or appeal the denial under 43 CFR part 4.

#### Subpart C - Returning Tribal Funds to Trust

##### § 1200.30 How does a tribe notify the Department if it wishes to return withdrawn funds to Federal trust status?

If a tribe elects to return some or all of the funds it has withdrawn from Federal trust status pursuant to this Act, it must first notify us in writing at our address in § 1200.13. This notification must provide a proposed date for the return of the funds, as well as the amount of funds to be returned, or actual securities to be delivered to the appropriate custodian.

##### § 1200.31 What part of withdrawn funds can be returned to trust?

A tribe may return all or a portion of the principal which was removed from trust under this Act along with earnings and profits. We will verify the amount declared for earnings before we accept a return. We will accept any amount less than the original principal amount as a principal amount.

##### § 1200.32 How often can funds be returned?

Tribes may return all or part of withdrawn funds no more than twice a year, beginning no sooner than six months after date of withdrawal, except with approval of the Secretary.

##### § 1200.33 How can funds be returned?

Funds may be returned either as cash or securities, which meet the requirements for investments in 25 U.S.C. 162a. Cash can be transferred to the US Treasury by Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT), or the Automated Clearing House (ACH) process. Tribes must coordinate the transfer of ownership in securities with us to ensure proper credit to the tribe. The securities must meet investment restrictions contained in 25 U.S.C. 162a.

##### § 1200.34 Can a tribe withdraw redeposited funds?

Yes. If a tribe wishes to withdraw redeposited funds from Federal trust status, it must submit a written request to do so, accompanied by a new resolution and any revisions it wishes to make in its original management plan.

#### Subpart D - Technical Assistance

##### § 1200.40 How will the Department provide technical assistance for tribes?

(a) We will provide direct or contract technical assistance, in accordance with appropriations availability to tribes for developing, implementing, and managing Indian trust fund investment plans. We will ensure that our legal, financial and other expertise is made fully available to advise tribes in developing, implementing, and managing investment plans.

(b) We may award grants to tribes for developing and implementing plans for investing Indian tribal trust funds.

(c) Tribes may also obtain technical assistance on their own.

##### § 1200.41 What types of technical assistance are available?

The types of technical assistance include: investment planning; accounting; selection of investment managers; monitoring of investments; asset management; or other assistance appropriate to support funds withdrawal.

##### § 1200.42 Who can provide technical assistance?

A sample of competent providers includes any of the following entities with the appropriate skills and capabilities: available DOI or OST staff; intertribal organizations; public agencies; and contracted private investment firms.

##### § 1200.43 How can a tribe apply for technical assistance?

(a) Tribes wishing technical assistance may request it by sending us a letter along with a tribal resolution outlining the technical assistance required, tribal resources which may be applied to the need, and suggested provider, if known. The resolution must state clearly that the assistance is needed for developing, implementing, or managing an investment plan under the provisions of this authority.

(b) Tribes requesting funds for technical assistance must send a completed SF&#x2013;424, APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE, and SF&#x2013;424A, BUDGET INFORMATION, along with a tribal resolution, detailing the assistance specifically requested, and the suggested provider to our address in § 1200.13.

(c) We will make grants subject to funds availability. We will publish a notice in theconcerning the availability of funding, deadlines for grants, the application process, and approval criteria. If funding is limited, grants will be awarded based on criteria that we feel will best meet the intent of the Act. We will consult with tribes in determining annual criteria. Unsolicited grant requests will not be accepted.

##### § 1200.44 What action will the Department take on requests for technical assistance?

We will respond in writing to all requests for technical assistance and grants, advising of decision, availability of appropriate expertise and funding, and anticipated delivery of the service.
