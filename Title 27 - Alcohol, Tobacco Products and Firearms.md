##### Subpart C - Standards of Identity for Wine

###### § 4.20 Application of standards.

The standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set forth herein shall be applicable to all regulations and permits issued under the act. Whenever any term for which a standard of identity has been established herein is used in any such regulation or permit, such term shall have the meaning assigned to it by such standard of identity.

###### § 4.21 The standards of identity.

Standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set forth in this part shall be as follows:

(a)&#x2014; (1)is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes (including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must and with or without added spirits of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382.

(2) Still grape wine may be ameliorated, or sweetened, before, during, or after fermentation, in a way that is consistent with the limits set forth in 26 U.S.C. 5383 for natural grape wine.

(3) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 degrees Celsius) for red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 degrees Celsius) for other grape wine, provided that the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 mL for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 mL for white wine.

(4) Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, or pulp of grapes may be designated as “red wine,” “pink (or rose) wine,” “amber wine,” or “white wine” as the case may be. Any grape wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further designated as “natural.”

(5)is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as “light wine,” “red table wine,” “light white wine,” “sweet table wine,” etc., as the case may be.

(6)is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as “sherry”. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as “angelica,” “madeira,” “muscatel,” or “port” respectively. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as “light sherry,” “light angelica,” “light madeira,” “light muscatel” or “light port,” respectively.

(b)(1)(including “sparkling wine,” “sparkling red wine” and “sparkling white wine”) is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.

(2)is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to champagne as made in the champagne district of France.

(3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for “champagne” may, in addition to but not in lieu of the class designation “sparkling wine,” be further designated as:

(A) “Champagne style;” or

(B) “Champagne type;” or

(C) “American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,” along with one of the following terms: “Bulk process,” “fermented outside the bottle,” “secondary fermentation outside the bottle,” “secondary fermentation before bottling,” “not fermented in the bottle,” or “not bottle fermented.” The term “charmat method” or “charmat process” may be used as additional information.

(ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the consumer with adequate information about the method of production and origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components of the further designation and the optional term “charmat method” or “charmat process,” as well as the contrast between the lettering and its background, and the placement of information on the label.

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of the required class designation “sparkling wine,” upon a finding that such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production of the sparkling wine.

(4)(including cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated “crackling wine&#x2014;bulk process,” and the words “bulk process” shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size as the words “crackling wine.”

(c)(includingand) is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide other than that resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle.

(d) [Reserved]

(e)

(1) Fruit wine is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe fruit (including restored or unrestored pure condensed fruit must) other than grapes, with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed fruit must and, with or without added spirits of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382.

(2) Fruit wine may be ameliorated, or sweetened, before, during, or after fermentation, in a way that is consistent with the limits set forth in 26 U.S.C. 5384 for natural fruit wine.

(3) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for fruit wine that does not contain added brandy or wine spirits, more than 0.14 gram, and for other fruit wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 degrees Celsius).

(4) Any fruit wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further designated as “natural.”

(5)is fruit wine produced from berries.

(6)oris fruit or berry wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated “light fruit wine,” or “light berry wine.”

(7)oris fruit or berry wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume.

(8) Fruit wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from one kind of fruit shall be designated by the word “wine” qualified by the name of such fruit,“peach wine,” “blackberry wine,” “orange wine.” Fruit wine not derived wholly from one kind of fruit shall be designated as “fruit wine” or “berry wine,” as the case may be, qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. If the fruit wine is derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from more than one citrus fruit, the designation “citrus wine” or “citrus fruit wine” may, but is not required to, be used instead of “fruit wine,” and the designation must also be qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Fruit wines which are derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples or pears may be designated “cider” and “perry,” respectively, and shall be so designated if lacking in vinous taste, aroma, and characteristics. Fruit wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or bottle shall be further designated as “sparkling”; and fruit wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be further designated as “carbonated.”

(f)(1)(i) Wine of this class is wine (other than grape wine, citrus wine, or fruit wine) made by the normal alcoholic fermentation of sound fermentable agricultural products, either fresh or dried, or of the restored or unrestored pure condensed must thereof, with the addition before or during fermentation of a volume of water not greater than the minimum necessary to correct natural moisture deficiencies in such products, with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed must, and with or without added alcohol or such other spirits as will not alter the character of the product, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment:That a domestic product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with part 24, of this chapter, and any product other than domestic may be ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar or such an amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more than 35 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content, derived by fermentation of more than 14 percent by volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.

(ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural wine of this class, more than 0.14 gram, and for other wine of this class, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 &#xB0;C.).

Any statement of alcoholic content shall be made as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Alcoholic content shall be stated in terms of percentage of alcohol by volume, and not otherwise, as provided in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section:

(1) “Alcohol __ % by volume,” or similar appropriate phrase;that if the word “alcohol” and/or “volume” are abbreviated, they shall be shown as “alc.” (alc) and/or “vol.” (vol), respectively. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a tolerance of 1 percent, in the case of wines containing more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and of 1.5 percent, in the case of wines containing 14 percent or less of alcohol by volume, will be permitted either above or below the stated percentage.

(2) “Alcohol __ % to __ % by volume,” or similar appropriate phrase;that if the word “alcohol” and/or “volume” are abbreviated, they shall be shown as “alc.” (alc) and/or “vol.” (vol), respectively. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a range of not more than 2 percent, in the case of wines containing more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, and of not more than 3 percent, in the case of wines containing 14 percent or less of alcohol by volume, will be permitted between the minimum and maximum percentages stated, and no tolerances will be permitted either below such minimum or above such maximum.

(c) Regardless of the type of statement used and regardless of tolerances normally permitted in direct statements and ranges normally permitted in maximum and minimum statements, alcoholic content statements, whether required or optional, shall definitely and correctly indicate the class, type and taxable grade of the wine so labeled and nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the appearance upon the labels of any wine of an alcoholic content statement in terms of maximum and minimum percentages which overlaps a prescribed limitation on the alcoholic content of any class, type, or taxable grade of wine, or a direct statement of alcoholic content which indicates that the alcoholic content of the wine is within such a limitation when in fact it is not.

###### § 4.37 Net contents.

(a)The net contents of wine for which a standard of fill is prescribed in § 4.72 shall be stated in the same manner and form as set forth in the standard of fill. The net content of wine for which no standard of fill is prescribed in § 4.72 shall be stated in the metric system of measure as follows:

(1) If more than one liter, net contents shall be stated in liters and in decimal portions of a liter accurate to the nearest one-hundredth of a liter.

(2) If less than one liter, net contents shall be stated in milliliters (ml).

(b)When net contents of wine are stated in metric measure, the equivalent volume in U.S. measure may also be shown. If shown, the U.S. equivalent volume will be shown as follows:

(1) For the metric standards of fill: 3 liters (101 fl. oz.); 1.5 liters (50.7 fl. oz.); 1 liter (33.8 fl. oz.); 750 ml (25.4 fl. oz.); 500 ml (16.9 fl. oz.); 375 ml (12.7 fl. oz.); 187 ml (6.3 fl. oz.); 100 ml (3.4 fl. oz.); and 50 ml (1.7 fl. oz.).

(2) Equivalent volumes of less than 100 fluid ounces will be stated in fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest one-tenth of a fluid ounce; for example, 700 ml (23.7 fl. oz.).

(3) Equivalent volumes of 100 fluid ounces or more will be stated in fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest whole fluid ounce; for example, 6 liters (203 fl. oz.).

(c)The net contents need not be stated on any label if the net contents are displayed by having the same blown, etched, sand-blasted, marked by underglaze coloring, or otherwise permanently marked by any method approved by the appropriate TTB officer, in the sides, front, or back of the bottle, in letters and figures in such manner as to be plainly legible under ordinary circumstances, and such statement is not obscured in any manner in whole or in part.

(d)Statement of net contents shall indicate exactly the volume of wine within the container, except that the following tolerances shall be allowed:

(1) Discrepancies due exclusively to errors in measuring which occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.

(2) Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing such containers so as to be of uniform capacity:That no greater tolerance shall be allowed in case of containers which, because of their design, cannot be made of approximately uniform capacity than is allowed in case of containers which can be manufactured so as to be of approximately uniform capacity.

(3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in containers to evaporation. The reasonableness to discrepancies under this paragraph shall be determined on the facts in each case.

(e)Unreasonable shortages in certain of the containers in any shipment shall not be compensated by overages in other containers in the same shipment.

###### § 4.38 General requirements.

(6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization;That this paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, blender, rectifier, importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of wine, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by him or his predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.

(7) Any statement, design, device, or representation (other than a statement of alcohol content in conformity with § 4.36), which tends to create the impression that a wine:

(i) Contains distilled spirits;

(ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or

(iii) Has intoxicating qualities.

(8) Any coined word or name in the brand name or class and type designation which simulates, imitates, or which tends to create the impression that the wine so labeled is entitled to bear, any class, type, or permitted designation recognized by the regulations in this part unless such wine conforms to the requirements prescribed with respect to such designation and is in fact so designated on its labels.

(9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, or created the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base. Examples of such words are: “Manhattan,” “Martini,” and “Daquiri” in a class and type designation or brand name of a wine cocktail; “Cuba Libre,” “Zombie,” and “Collins” in a class and type designation or brand name of a wine specialty or wine highball; “creme,” “cream,” “de,” or “of” when used in conjunction with “menthe,” “mint,” or “cacao” in a class and type designation or a brand name of a mint or chocolate flavored wine specialty.

(c)The statement of any bottling date shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such statement appears in lettering not greater than 8-point Gothic caps and in the following form: “Bottled in __” (inserting the year in which the wine was bottled).

(d)No date, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to statement of vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated on any label unless in addition thereto and in direct conjunction therewith in the same size and kind of printing, there shall be stated an explanation of the significance thereof such as “established” or “founded in”. If any such date refers to the date of establishment of any business or brand name, it shall not be stated, in the case of containers of a capacity of 5 liters or less, in any script, type, or printing larger than 2 millimeters, and shall be stated in direct conjunction with the name of the person, company, or brand name to which it refers if the appropriate TTB officer finds that this is necessary in order to prevent confusion as to the person, company, or brand name to which the establishment date is applicable.

(e)(1) No labels shall be of such design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States Government or any State or foreign government. No label, other than stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the wine contained in the labeled container is produced, blended, bottled, packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State or Federal Government authorization, law, or regulation, unless such statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, State or municipal law or regulation, or is required or specifically authorized by the laws or regulations of a foreign country. If the municipal, State, or Federal Government permit number is stated upon a label, it shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.

(2) Bonded wine cellar and bonded winery numbers may be stated but only in direct conjunction with the name and address of the person operating such wine cellar or winery. Statement of bonded wine cellar or winery numbers may be made in the following form: “Bonded Wine Cellar No. __”, “Bonded Winery No. __”, “B. W. C. No. __”, “B. W. No. __”. No additional reference thereto shall be made, nor shall any use be made of such statement that may convey the impression that the wine has been made or matured under Government supervision or in accordance with Government specifications or standards.

(3) If imported wines are covered by a certificate of origin and/or a certificate of vintage date issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate foreign government, the label, except where prohibited by the foreign government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of such certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional statements relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or certification shall be substantially in the following form:

(f)The wordor similar words, shall not be stated on labels on containers of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of a permittee for or by whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed:That in all cases where such words are used as part of such name, there shall be stated on the same label the words “Product of the United States”, or similar words to negative any impression that the product is imported, and such negative statement shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.

(g)Labels shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.

(h)&#x2014;(1)When used in this paragraph (h), terms are defined as follows:

(i)means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required by § 16.21 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.

(ii)is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.

(iii)is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption.

(2)&#x2014;(i)In general, labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.

(ii)(A) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on a wine label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on a wine label.

(B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a wine label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.

(iii)A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it&#x2014;

(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and

(B)() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or

() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.

(i)(1) Except as provided in subparagraph 2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named.

(2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval issued prior to July 7, 1986:

(i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named; or

(ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in accordance with § 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either:

(A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or;

(B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears a state name; or

(iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of the origin of the wine.

(3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, or when found to have viticultural significance by the appropriate TTB officer.

(j)The use of product names with specific geographical significance is prohibited unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that because of their long usage, such names are recognized by consumers as fanciful product names and not representations as to origin. In such cases the product names shall be qualified with the word “brand” immediately following the product name, in the same size of type, and as conspicuous as the product name itself. In addition, the label shall bear an appellation of origin under the provisions of § 4.34(b), and, if required by the appropriate TTB officer, a statement disclaiming the geographical reference as a representation as to the origin of the wine.

(k)Other statements, designs, devices or representations which indicate or infer an origin other than the true place of origin of the wine are prohibited.

(l)Foreign terms which: (1) Describe a particular condition of the grapes at the time of harvest (such as “Auslese,” “Eiswein,” and “Trockenbeerenauslese”); or (2) denote quality under foreign law (such as “Qualitatswein” and “Kabinett”) may not be used on the labels of American wine.

(m)When used in a brand name, a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name having geographical or viticultural significance is subject to the requirements of §§ 4.33(b) and 4.39(i) of this part. Additionally, the name of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch shall not be used on a wine label, unless 95 percent of the wine in the container was produced from primary winemaking material grown on the named vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch.

(n)Labels that contain in the brand name, product name, or distinctive or fanciful name, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive designation, are misleading unless the wine is made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 of § 4.21. Any other use of such a designation on other than a class 1, 2, or 3 wine is presumed misleading.

##### Subpart E - Requirements for Withdrawal of Wine From Customs Custody

###### § 4.40 Label approval and release.

(a)Wine, imported in containers, is not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such wine from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the wine has obtained and is in possession of a certificate of label approval (COLA) and the containers bear labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the certificate, or labels with changes authorized by the form. Any person removing wine in containers from customs custody for consumption must first apply for and obtain a COLA covering the wine from the appropriate TTB officer, or obtain authorization to use the COLA from the person to whom the COLA is issued. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer. If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the brand or lot of wine to be imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer. The COLA requirement imposed by this section applies only to wine that is removed for sale or any other commercial purpose. See 27 CFR 27.49, 27.74 and 27.75 for labeling exemptions applicable to certain imported samples of wine.

(b) [Reserved]

(c)Imported wine in U.S. Customs custody which is not labeled in conformity with certificates of label approval issued by the appropriate TTB officer must be relabeled prior to release under the supervision and direction of customs officers of the port at which the wine is located.

(d)For procedures regarding the issuance, denial, and revocation of certificates of label approval, as well as appeal procedures, see part 13 of this chapter.

###### § 4.45 Certificates of origin, identity and proper cellar treatment.

(a)Wine imported in containers is not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such wine from customs custody for consumption, unless that person has obtained, and is in possession of an invoice accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the appropriate foreign government if that country requires the issuance of such a certificate for wine exported from that country. The certificate must have been issued by an official duly authorized by the foreign government, and it must certify as to the identity of the wine and that the wine has been produced in compliance with the laws of the foreign country regulating the production of the wine for home consumption.

(b)&#x2014;(1)An importer of wine may be required to have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody a certification or may have to comply with other conditions prescribed in § 27.140 of this chapter regarding proper cellar treatment. If imported wine requires a certification under § 27.140, the importer must provide a copy of that certification to TTB as follows:

(i) The importer must attach a copy of the certification to the application for a certificate of label approval for the wine in question submitted under § 13.21 of this chapter; or

(ii) If a certification for the wine in question was not available when the importer submitted the application for label approval, the importer must submit a copy of the certification to the appropriate TTB officer prior to release from customs custody of the first shipment of the wine.

(2)A certification submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is valid as long as the wine is of the same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the certification. Accordingly, if the cellar treatment of the wine changes and a new certification under § 27.140 is required, an importer is required to submit a new certification for the wine even though it is subject to the same label approval.

(3)TTB may use the information from a certification for purposes of verifying the appropriate class and type designation of the wine under the labeling provisions of this part. TTB will make certifications submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section available to the public on the TTB Internet Web site at

(c)The importer of wine imported in containers must retain for five years following the date of the removal of the bottled wine from customs custody copies of the certificates (and accompanying invoices, if required) required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and must provide them upon request of the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.

##### Subpart F - Requirements for Approval of Labels of Wine Domestically Bottled or Packed

###### § 4.50 Certificates of label approval.

(a) No person shall bottle or pack wine, other than wine bottled or packed in U.S. Customs custody, or remove such wine from the plant where bottled or packed, unless an approved certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31, is issued by the appropriate TTB officer.

(b) Any bottler or packer of wine shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if upon application the bottler or packer shows to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the wine to be bottled or packed is not to be sold, offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced in interstate or foreign commerce. Application for exemption shall be made on TTB Form 5100.31 in accordance with instructions on the form. If the application is approved, a certificate of exemption will be issued on the same form.

(c)For procedures regarding the issuance, denial, and revocation of certificates of label approval, and certificates of exemption from label approval, as well as appeal procedures, see part 13 of this chapter.

###### § 4.51 Exhibiting certificates to Government officials.

Any bottler or packer holding an original or duplicate original of a certificate of label approval or a certificate of exemption shall, upon demand, exhibit such certificate to a duly authorized representative of the United States Government.

###### § 4.52 Photoprints.

Photoprints or other reproductions of certificates of label approval or certificates of exemption are not acceptable, for the purposes of §§ 4.50 through 4.52, as substitutes for an original or duplicate original of a certificate of label approval, or a certificate of exemption. The appropriate TTB officer will, upon the request of the bottler or packer, issue duplicate originals of certificates of label approval or of certificates of exemption if wine under the same brand is bottled or packed at more than one plant by the same person, and if the necessity for the duplicate originals is shown and there is listed with the appropriate TTB officer the name and address of the additional bottling or packing plant where the particular label is to be used.

###### § 4.53 Retention of certificates.

Wine that would be required under § 4.45 to be covered by a certificate of origin and identity and/or a certification of proper cellar treatment and that is imported in bulk for bottling in the United States may be removed for consumption from the premises where bottled only if the bottler possesses a certificate of origin and identity and/or a certification of proper cellar treatment of natural wine applicable to the wine, issued by the appropriate entity as set forth in §§ 4.45 and 27.140 of this chapter respectively, that provides the same information as a certificate required under § 4.45(a) and (b) would provide for like wine imported in bottles. The bottler of wine imported in bulk must retain for five years following the removal of such wine from the bonded wine cellar where bottled copies of the certificates required by § 4.45(a) and (b), and must provide them upon request of the appropriate TTB officer.

###### § 4.54 Personalized labels.

(a)Applicants for label approval may obtain permission from TTB to make certain changes in order to personalize labels without having to resubmit labels for TTB approval. A personalized label is an alcohol beverage label that meets the minimum mandatory label requirements and is customized for customers. Personalized labels may contain a personal message, picture, or other artwork that is specific to the consumer who is purchasing the product. For example, a winery may offer individual or corporate customers labels that commemorate an event such as a wedding or grand opening.

(b)Any person who intends to offer personalized labels must submit a template for the personalized label as part of the application for label approval required under §§ 4.40 or 4.50 of this part, and must note on the application a description of the specific personalized information that may change.

(c)If the application complies with the regulations, TTB will issue a certificate of label approval (COLA) with a qualification allowing the personalization of labels. The qualification will allow the certificate holder to add or change items on the personalized label such as salutations, names, graphics, artwork, congratulatory dates and names, or event dates without applying for a new COLA. All of these items on personalized labels must comply with the regulations of this part.

(d)Approval of an application to personalize labels does not authorize the addition of any information that discusses either the alcohol beverage or characteristics of the alcohol beverage or that is inconsistent with or in violation of the provisions of this part or any other applicable provision of law or regulations.

##### Subpart G - Advertising of Wine

###### § 4.60 Application.

No person engaged in the business as a producer, rectifier, blender, importer, or wholesaler of wine, directly or indirectly or through an affiliate, shall publish or disseminate or cause to be published or disseminated by radio or television broadcast, or in any newspaper, periodical, or any publication, by any sign or outdoor advertisement, or any other printed or graphic matter, any advertisement of wine, if such advertising is in, or is calculated to induce sale in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail, unless such advertisement is in conformity with §§ 4.60&#x2013;4.65 of this part.

(a)Any person removing distilled spirits in containers from customs custody for consumption must first apply for and obtain a certificate of label approval (COLA) covering the distilled spirits from the appropriate TTB officer, or obtain authorization to use the COLA from the person to whom the COLA is issued.

(b)Distilled spirits, imported in containers, are not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such distilled spirits from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the distilled spirits has obtained a COLA covering the distilled spirits and is able to provide it (either electronically or on paper) upon request. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer.

(c)If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned identification number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the product or lot of distilled spirits to be imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at the time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.

(d)Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, an importer must provide evidence that a container of distilled spirits is covered by a COLA. This requirement may be satisfied by providing original COLAs, photocopies or electronic copies of COLAs, or records showing the TTB identification number assigned to the approved certificate.

(e)The COLA requirement imposed by this section applies only to distilled spirits that are removed for sale or any other commercial purpose. Distilled spirits that are imported in containers are not eligible for a certificate of exemption from label approval. See 27 CFR 27.49, 27.74, and 27.75 for labeling exemptions applicable to certain imported samples of distilled spirits.

(f)Containers of distilled spirits in customs custody that are required to be covered by a COLA but are not labeled in conformity with a COLA must be relabeled, under the supervision and direction of customs officers, prior to their removal from customs custody for consumption.

(b)Labels may not include any misleading brand names. A brand name is misleading if it creates (by itself or in association with other printed or graphic matter) any erroneous impression or inference as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the distilled spirits. A brand name that would otherwise be misleading may be qualified with the word “brand” or with some other qualification, if the appropriate TTB officer determines that the qualification dispels any misleading impression that might otherwise be created.

###### § 5.65 Alcohol content.

(a)The alcohol content for distilled spirits must be stated on the label as a percentage of alcohol by volume.

###### § 5.66 Name and address for domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in the United States.

(a)Domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in the United States and contain no imported distilled spirits must be labeled in accordance with this section. (See §§ 5.67 and 5.68 for name and address requirements applicable to distilled spirits that are not wholly made in the United States.) For purposes of this section, a “processor” who solely bottles the labeled distilled spirits will be considered the “bottler.”

(b)The bottler, distiller, or processor of the distilled spirits must be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person. If that person performs more than one function, the label may (but is not required to) so indicate.

(1) If the name of the bottler appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “bottled by,” “canned by,” “packed by,” or “filled by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler.

(2) If the name of the processor appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “blended by,” “made by,” “prepared by,” “produced by,” or “manufactured by,” as appropriate, followed by the name and address of the processor. When applied to distilled spirits, the term “produced by” indicates a processing operation (formerly known as rectification) that involves a change in the class or type of the product through the addition of flavors or some other processing activity.

(3) If the name of the distiller appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by,” followed by the name and address of the distiller. If the distilled spirits were bottled for the distiller thereof, the name and address of the distiller may be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by and bottled for,” or “bottled for.”

(c)If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person.

(d)&#x2014;(1)The address consists of the city and State where the operation occurred, or the city and State of the principal place of business of the person performing the operation. This information must be consistent with the information on the basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.

(2)If the bottler, distiller, or processor listed on the name and address statement is the actual operator of more than one distilled spirits plant engaged in bottling, distilling, or processing operations, as applicable, the label may state, immediately following the name of the permittee, the addresses of those other plants, in addition to the address of the plant at which the distilled spirits were bottled. In this situation, the address where the operation occurred must be indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.

(3)The label may provide the address of the bottler's, distiller's, or processor's principal place of business, in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred, provided that the address where the operation occurred is indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.

(4)(i) If distilled spirits are bottled for another person, other than the actual distiller thereof, the label may state, in addition to (but not in place of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words “bottled for” or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract bottling).

(ii) If the same brand of distilled spirits is bottled by two distillers that are not under the same ownership, the label for each distiller may set forth both locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.

(5)No additional places or addresses may be stated for the same person unless:

(i) That person is actively engaged in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual alcohol beverage business at such additional place or address, and

(ii) The label also contains in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or address in connection with the particular product (such as “distilled by.”)

(e)If “straight whiskies” (see § 5.143) of the same type are distilled in the same State by two or more different distillers and are combined (either at the time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded premises for further storage) and subsequently bottled and labeled as “straight whisky,” that “straight whisky” must bear a label that contains name and address information of the bottler. If that combined “straight whisky” is bottled by or for the distillers, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the label may contain the words “distilled by,” followed immediately by the names (or trade names) and addresses of the different distillers who distilled a portion of the “straight whisky” and the percentage of “straight whisky” distilled by each distiller, with a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent. If “straight whisky” consists of a mixture of “straight whiskies” of the same type from two or more different distilleries of the same proprietor located within the same State, and if that “straight whisky” is bottled by or for that proprietor, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the “straight whisky” may bear a label containing the words “distilled by” followed by the name (or trade name) of the proprietor and the addresses of the different distilleries that distilled a portion of the “straight whisky.”

(f)(1) The State of distillation, which is the State in which original distillation takes place, must appear on the label of any type of whisky defined in § 5.143(c)(2) through (7), which is distilled in the United States. The State of distillation may appear on any label and must be shown in at least one of the following ways:

(i) By including a “distilled by” (or “distilled and bottled by” or any other phrase including the word “distilled”) statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location.

(ii) If the address shown in the “bottled by” statement includes the State in which distillation occurred, by including a “bottled by” statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;

(iii) By including the name of the State in which original distillation occurred immediately adjacent to the class or type designation (such as “Kentucky bourbon whisky”), as long as the product was both distilled and aged in that State in conformance with the requirements of § 5.143(b); or

(iv) By including a separate statement, such as “Distilled in [name of State].”

(2) The appropriate TTB officer may require that the State of distillation or other information appear on a label of any whisky subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section (and may prescribe placement requirements for such information), even if that State appears in the name and address statement, if such additional information is necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive impression that might otherwise be created as regards the actual State of distillation.

(3) In the case of “light whisky,” the State name “Kentucky” or “Tennessee” may not appear on any label, except as a part of a name and address as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.

(g)The name of the person appearing on the label may be the trade name or the operating name, as long as it is identical to a trade or operating name appearing on the basic permit. In the case of a distillation statement for spirits bottled in bond, the name or trade name under which the spirits were distilled must be shown.

###### § 5.67 Name and address for domestically bottled distilled spirits that were bottled after importation.

(a)This section applies to distilled spirits that were bottled after importation. See § 5.68 for name and address requirements applicable to imported distilled spirits that were imported in a container.

(3) If the distilled spirits were bottled by the person responsible for the importation, the words “imported by and bottled (canned, packed, or filled) in the United States by” (or a similar appropriate phrase) followed by the name and address of the principal place of business in the United States of the person responsible for the importation.

(c)Distilled spirits that, after importation in bulk, were blended, made, prepared, produced, manufactured or further distilled, may not bear an “imported by” statement on the label, but must instead be labeled in accordance with the rules set forth in § 5.66 for mandatory and optional labeling statements.

(d)In addition to the statements required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the label may also state the name and address of the principal place of business of the foreign producer.

(e)(1) The address consists of the city and State where the operation occurred, or the city and State of the principal place of business of the person performing the operation. This information must be consistent with the information on the basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses.

(2) If the bottler or processor listed on the name and address statement is the actual operator of more than one distilled spirits plant engaged in bottling, distilling, or processing operations, as applicable, the label may state, immediately following the name of the bottler, the addresses of those other plants, in addition to the address of the plant at which the distilled spirits were bottled. In this situation, the address where the operation occurred must be indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.

(3) The label may provide the address of the bottler's or processor's principal place of business, in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred, provided that the address where the operation occurred is indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.

(f)A trade name may be used if the trade name is listed on the basic permit or other qualifying documentation.

###### § 5.68 Name and address for distilled spirits that were imported in a container.

(a)This section applies to distilled spirits that were imported in a container, as defined in § 5.1. See § 5.67 for name and address requirements applicable to distilled spirits that were domestically bottled after importation. See 19 CFR parts 102 and 134 for U.S. Customs and Border Protection country of origin marking requirements.

(b)Distilled spirits imported in containers, as defined in § 5.1, must bear a label stating the words “imported by” or a similar appropriate phrase, followed by the name and address of the importer.

(1) For purposes of this section, the importer is the holder of the importer's basic permit who either makes the original customs entry or is the person for whom such entry is made, or the holder of the importer's basic permit who is the agent, distributor, or franchise holder for the particular brand of imported alcohol beverages and who places the order abroad.

###### § 5.69 Country of origin.

For U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rules regarding country of origin marking requirements, see the CBP regulations at 19 CFR parts 102 and 134.

###### § 5.70 Net contents.

The requirements of this section apply to the net contents statement required by § 5.63.

(a)The volume of spirits in the container must appear on a label as a net contents statement. The word “liter” may be alternatively spelled “litre” or may be abbreviated as “L”. The word “milliliters” may be abbreviated as “ml.,” “mL.,” or “ML.” Net contents in equivalent U.S. customary units of measurement and in metric equivalents such as centiliters may appear on a label and, if used, must appear in the same field of vision as the metric net contents statement.

(b)(1) The following tolerances are permissible for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section:

(i)Discrepancies due to errors in measuring that occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice;

(ii)Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing the containers so as to be of uniform capacity, provided that the discrepancy does not result from a container design that prevents the manufacture of containers of an approximately uniform capacity; and

(iii)Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric conditions in various places, including discrepancies resulting from the ordinary and customary exposure of alcohol beverage products in containers to evaporation, provided that the discrepancy is determined to be reasonable on a case by case basis.

(2)A contents shortage in certain of the containers in a shipment may not be counted against a contents overage in other containers in the same shipment for purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of this section.

###### § 5.71 Neutral spirits and name of commodity.

(a) In the case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, flavored neutral spirits, including flavored vodka, and distilled spirits specialty products) manufactured by blending or other processing, if neutral spirits were used in the production of the spirits, the percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from which the neutral spirits were distilled must appear on a label. The statement of percentage and the name of the commodity must be in substantially the following form: “____% neutral spirits distilled from____ (insert grain, cane products, fruit, or other commodity as appropriate)”; or “____ % neutral spirits (vodka) distilled from ____ (insert grain, cane products, fruit, or other commodity as appropriate)”; or “____ % (grain) (cane products), (fruit) neutral spirits”, or “____ % grain spirits.”

(b) In the case of gin manufactured by a process of continuous distillation or in the case of neutral spirits, a label on the container must state the name of the commodity from which the gin or neutral spirits were distilled. The statement of the name of the commodity must appear in substantially the following form: “Distilled from grain” or “Distilled from cane products”.

###### § 5.72 Coloring materials.

The words “artificially colored” must appear on a label of any distilled spirits product containing synthetic or natural materials that primarily contribute color, or when information on a label conveys the impression that a color was derived from a source other than the actual source of the color, except that:

(a) If no coloring material other than a color exempt from certification under FDA regulations has been added, a truthful statement of the source of the color may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored,” for example, “Contains Beta Carotene” or “Colored with beet extract.” See 21 CFR parts 73 and 74 for the list of such colors under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations;

(b) If no coloring material has been added other than one certified as suitable for use in foods by the FDA, the words “(to be filled in with name of) certified color added” or “Contains Certified Color” may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored”; and

(c) If no coloring material other than caramel has been added, the words “colored with caramel,” “contains caramel color,” or another statement specifying the use of caramel color, may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored.” However, no statement of any type is required for the use of caramel color in brandy, rum, or Tequila, or in any type of whisky other than straight whisky if used at not more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product.

(d) As provided in § 5.61, the use of FD&C Yellow No. 5, carmine, or cochineal extract must be specifically stated on the label even if the label also contains a phrase such as “contains certified color” or “artificially colored.”

###### § 5.73 Treatment of whisky or brandy with wood.

The words “colored and flavored with wood____ ” (inserting “chips,” “slabs,” etc., as appropriate) must appear immediately adjacent to, and in the same size of type as, the class and type designation under subpart I of this part for whisky and brandy treated, in whole or in part, with wood through percolation or otherwise during distillation or storage, other than through contact with an oak barrel. However, the statement specified in this section is not required in the case of brandy treated with an infusion of oak chips in accordance with § 5.155(b)(3)(B).

###### § 5.74 Statements of age, storage, and percentage.

(a)(1) As defined in § 5.1, age is the length of time during which, after distillation and before bottling, the distilled spirits have been stored in oak barrels. For bourbon whisky, rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, and straight whiskies other than straight corn whisky, aging must occur in charred new oak barrels.

(2) If an age statement is used, it is permissible to understate the age of a product, but overstatements of age are prohibited. However, the age statement may not conflict with the standard of identity, if aging is required as part of the standard of identity. For example, the standard of identity for straight rye whisky requires that the whisky be aged for a minimum of 2 years, so the age statement “Aged 1 year,” would be prohibited for a product designated as “straight” rye whisky, even if the spirits were actually aged for more than 2 years, because it is inconsistent with the standard of identity.

(3)The age may be stated in years, months, or days.

(b)For all domestic or foreign whiskies that are aged less than 4 years, including blends containing a whisky that is aged less than 4 years, an age statement and percentage of types of whisky statement is required to appear on a label, unless the whisky is labeled as “bottled in bond” in conformity with § 5.88. For all other whiskies, the statements are optional, but if used, they must conform to the formatting requirements listed below. Moreover, if the bottler chooses to include a statement of age or percentage on the label of a product that is 4 years old or more and that contains neutral spirits, the statement must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by § 5.70. The following are the allowable formats for the age and percentage statements for whisky:

(1)(i) In the case of whisky, whether or not mixed or blended but containing no neutral spirits, the age of the youngest whisky in the product. The age statement must appear substantially as follows: “____ years old”; and

(ii) If a whisky is aged in more than one container, the label may optionally indicate the types of oak containers used.

(2) In the case of whisky containing neutral spirits, whether or not mixed or blended, if any straight whisky or other whisky in the product is less than 4 years old, the percentage by volume of each such whisky and the age of each such whisky (the age of the youngest of the straight whiskies or other whiskies if the product contains two or more of either). The age and percentage statement for a straight whisky and other whisky must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by § 5.70 and must read substantially as follows:

(i) If the product contains only one straight whisky and no other whisky: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old;”

(ii) If the product contains more than one straight whisky but no other whisky: “____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old.” In this case the age blank must state the age of the youngest straight whisky in the product. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old”;

(iii) If the product contains only one straight whisky and one other whisky: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old”; or

(iv) If the product contains more than one straight whisky and more than one other whisky: “____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old, ____ percent whiskies ____ years or more old.” In this case, the age blanks must state the age of the youngest straight whisky and the age of the youngest other whisky. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent whisky ____ years old”;

(3) In the case of an imported rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, a label on the product must state each age and percentage in the manner and form that would be required if the whisky had been made in the United States;

(4) In the case of whisky made in the United States and stored in reused oak barrels, other than corn whisky and light whisky, in lieu of the words “____ years old” specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the period of storage in the reused oak barrels must appear on the label as follows: “stored ____ years in reused cooperage.”

(c)A statement of age on labels of rums, brandies, and agave spirits is optional, except that, in the case of brandy (other than immature brandies, fruit brandies, marc brandy, pomace brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy, which are not customarily stored in oak barrels) not stored in oak barrels for a period of at least two years, a statement of age must appear on the label. Any statement of age authorized or required under this paragraph must appear substantially as follows: “____ years old,” with the blank to be filled in with the age of the youngest distilled spirits in the product.

(d)In the case of grain spirits, the period of storage in oak barrels may appear on a label immediately adjacent to the percentage statement required under § 5.73, for example: “____ % grain spirits stored ____ years in oak barrels.”

(e)(1) Statements regarding age or maturity or similar statements or representations on labels for all other spirits, except neutral spirits, are permitted only when the distilled spirits are stored in an oak barrel and, once dumped from the barrel, subjected to no treatment besides mixing with water, filtering, and bottling. If batches are made from barrels of spirits of different ages, the label may only state the age of the youngest spirits.

(2) Statements regarding age or maturity or similar statements of neutral spirits (except for grain spirits as stated in paragraph (c) of this section) are prohibited from appearing on any label.

(f)(1) If a representation that is similar to an age or maturity statement permitted under this section appears on a label, a statement of age, in a manner that is conspicuous and in characters at least half the type size of the representation must also appear on each label that carries the representation, except in the following cases:

(i) The use of the word “old” or another word denoting age as part of the brand name of the product is not deemed to be an age representation that requires a statement of age; and

(ii) Labels of whiskies and brandies (other than immature brandies, pomace brandy, marc brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy) not required to bear a statement of age, and rum and agave spirits aged for not less than four years, may contain general inconspicuous age, maturity or similar representations without the label having to bear an age statement.

(2) Distillation dates (which may be an exact date or a year) may appear on a label of spirits where the spirits are manufactured solely through distillation. A distillation date may only appear if an optional or mandatory age statement is used on the label and must appear in the same field of vision as the age statement.

##### Subpart F - Restricted Labeling Statements.

###### § 5.81 General.

(a)The labeling practices, statements, and representations in this subpart may be used on distilled spirits labels only when used in compliance with this subpart. In addition, if any of the practices, statements, or representations in this subpart are used elsewhere on containers or in packaging, they must comply with the requirements of this subpart. For purposes of this subpart:

(iii) The names “egg” and “peanuts,” as well as the names of the different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or plural form, and the name “soy,” “soybean,” or “soya” may be used instead of “soybeans.”

(b)Major food allergens used in the production of a distilled spirits product may, on a voluntary basis, be declared on any label affixed to the container. However, if any one major food allergen is voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the distilled spirits product, including major food allergens used as fining or processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a petition for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under § 5.83. The major food allergens declaration must consist of the word “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived (for example, “Contains: egg”).

###### § 5.83 Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.

(a)Any person may petition the appropriate TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the labeling requirements of § 5.82. The burden is on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (as well as the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, either:

(1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or

(2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the foods identified in § 5.82(a)(1)(i), even though a major food allergen was used in production.

(b)TTB will approve or deny a petition for exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval or denial under this section will constitute final agency action.

(c)After a petition for exemption is denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB will treat this submission as a new petition.

(d)&#x2014;(1)TTB will promptly post to its website () all petitions received under this section, as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to the TTB website will be available to the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, at 5 U.S.C. 552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2)A person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial information in connection with a petition for exemption under this section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of information under this section must conform to the following standards:

(i) The request must be in writing;

(ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept confidential;

(iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of that person;

(iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information should not be disclosed, including the reasons why the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested person; and

(v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or other confidential commercial or financial information and that the information is not already in the public domain.

###### § 5.84 Use of the term “organic.”

Use of the term “organic” is permitted if any such use complies with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program rules (7 CFR part 205), as interpreted by the USDA.

###### § 5.85 [Reserved]

###### § 5.86 [Reserved]

###### § 5.87 “Barrel Proof” and similar terms.

(a) The term “barrel proof” or “cask strength” may be used to refer to distilled spirits stored in wood barrels only when the bottling proof is not more than two degrees lower than the proof of the spirits when the spirits are dumped from the barrels.

(b) The term “original proof,” “original barrel proof,” “original cask strength,” or “entry proof” may be used only if the distilled spirits were stored in wooden barrels and the proof of the spirits entered into the barrel and the proof of the bottled spirits are the same.

###### § 5.88 Bottled in bond.

(a) The term “bond,” “bonded,” “bottled in bond,” or “aged in bond,” or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, may be used (including as part of the brand name) only if the distilled spirits are:

(1) Composed of the same kind (type, if one is applicable to the spirits, otherwise class) of spirits distilled from the same class of materials;

(2) Distilled in the same distilling season (as defined in § 5.1) by the same distiller at the same distillery.

(3) Stored for at least 4 years in wooden containers wherein the spirits have been in contact with the wood surface, except for vodka, which must be stored for at least 4 years in wooden containers coated or lined with paraffin or other substance which will preclude contact of the spirits with the wood surface, and except for gin, which must be stored in paraffin-lined or unlined wooden containers for at least 4 years;

(4) Unaltered from their original condition or character by the addition or subtraction of any substance other than by filtration, chill proofing, or other physical treatments (which do not involve the addition of any substance which will remain in the finished product or result in a change in class or type);

(5) Reduced in proof by the addition of only pure water to 50 percent alcohol by volume (100 degrees of proof); and

(6) Bottled at 50 percent alcohol by volume (100 degrees of proof).

(b) Imported spirits labeled as “bottled in bond” or other synonymous term described above must be manufactured in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section and may only be so labeled if the laws and regulations of the country in which the spirits are manufactured authorize the bottling of spirits in bond and require or specifically authorize such spirits to be so labeled. The “bottled in bond” or synonymous statement must be immediately followed, in the same font and type size, by the name of the country under whose laws and regulations such distilled spirits were so bottled.

(c) Domestically manufactured spirits labeled as “bottled in bond” or with some other synonymous statement must bear the real name of the distillery or the trade name under which the distiller distilled and warehoused the spirits, and the number of the distilled spirits plant in which distilled, and the number of the distilled spirits plant in which bottled. The label may also bear the name or trade name of the bottler.

###### § 5.89 Multiple distillation claims.

(a) Truthful statements about the number of distillations, such as “double distilled,” “distilled three times,” or similar terms to convey multiple distillations, may be used if they are truthful statements of fact. For the purposes of this section only, the term “distillation” means a single run through a pot still or a single run through a column of a column (reflux) still. For example, if a column still has three separate columns, one complete additional run through the system would constitute three additional distillations.

###### § 5.90 Terms related to Scotland.

(a) The words “Scotch,” “Scots,” “Highland,” or “Highlands,” and similar words connoting, indicating, or commonly associated with Scotland, may be used to designate only distilled spirits wholly manufactured in Scotland, except that the term “Scotch whisky” may appear in the designation for a flavored spirit (“Flavored Scotch Whisky”) or in a truthful statement of composition (“Scotch whisky with natural flavors”) where the base distilled spirit meets the requirements for a Scotch whisky designation, regardless of where the finished product is manufactured.

(b) In accordance with § 5.127, statements relating to government supervision may appear on Scotch whisky containers only if such labeling statements are required or specifically authorized by the applicable regulations of the United Kingdom.

###### § 5.91 Use of the term “pure.”

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not bear the word “pure” unless it:

(a) Refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about that ingredient;

(c) Is part of the bona fide name of the permittee that bottled the distilled spirits.

##### Subpart G - Prohibited Labeling Practices

###### § 5.101 General.

(a)The prohibitions set forth in this subpart apply to any distilled spirits label, container, or packaging. For purposes of this subpart:

(1) The term “label” includes all labels on distilled spirits containers on which mandatory information may appear, as set forth in § 5.61(a), as well as any other label on the container;

(2) The term “container” includes all parts of the distilled spirits container, including any part of a distilled spirits container on which mandatory information may appear, as well as those parts of the container on which information does not satisfy mandatory labeling requirements, as set forth in § 5.61(b); and

(3) The term “packaging” includes any carton, case, carrier, individual covering or other packaging of such containers used for sale at retail, but does not include shipping cartons or cases that are not intended to accompany the container to the consumer.

(b)For purposes of the practices in this subpart, the term “statement or representation” includes any statement, design, device, or representation, and includes pictorial or graphic designs or representations as well as written ones. The term “statement or representation” includes explicit and implicit statements and representations.

###### § 5.102 False or untrue statements.

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation that is false or untrue in any particular.

###### § 5.103 Obscene or indecent depictions.

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement, design, device, picture, or representation that is obscene or indecent.

##### Subpart H - Labeling Practices That Are Prohibited If They Are Misleading

###### § 5.121 General.

(a)The labeling practices that are prohibited if misleading set forth in this subpart apply to any distilled spirits label, container, or packaging. For purposes of this subpart:

(1) The term “label” includes all labels on distilled spirits containers on which mandatory information may appear, as set forth in § 5.61(a), as well as any other label on the container;

(2) The term “container” includes all parts of the distilled spirits container, including any part of a distilled spirits container on which mandatory information may appear, as well as those parts of the container on which information does not satisfy mandatory labeling requirements, as set forth in § 5.61(b); and

(3) The term “packaging” includes any carton, case, carrier, individual covering or other packaging of such containers used for sale at retail, but does not include shipping cartons or cases that are not intended to accompany the container to the consumer.

(b)For purposes of this subpart, the term “statement or representation” includes any statement, design, device, or representation, and includes pictorial or graphic designs or representations as well as written ones. The term “statement or representation” includes explicit and implicit statements and representations.

###### § 5.122 Misleading statements or representations.

(a)Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation, irrespective of falsity, that is misleading to consumers as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the distilled spirits, or with regard to any other material factor.

(b)(1) A statement or representation is prohibited, irrespective of falsity, if it directly creates a misleading impression, or if it does so indirectly through ambiguity, omission, inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific, or technical matter. For example, an otherwise truthful statement may be misleading because of the omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.

(2) All claims, whether implicit or explicit, must have a reasonable basis in fact. Any claim on distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging that does not have a reasonable basis in fact, or cannot be adequately substantiated upon the request of the appropriate TTB officer, is considered misleading.

###### § 5.123 Guarantees.

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement relating to guarantees if the appropriate TTB officer finds it is likely to mislead the consumer. However, money-back guarantees are not prohibited.

###### § 5.124 Disparaging statements.

(a)Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any false or misleading statement that explicitly or implicitly disparages a competitor's product.

(b)This section does not prevent truthful and accurate comparisons between products (such as, “Our liqueur contains more strawberries than Brand X”) or statements of opinion (such as, “We think our rum tastes better than any other distilled spirits on the market”).

###### § 5.125 Tests or analyses.

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation of or relating to analyses, standards, or tests, whether or not it is true, that is likely to mislead the consumer. An example of such a misleading statement is “tested and approved by our research laboratories” if the testing and approval does not in fact have any significance.

###### § 5.126 Depictions of government symbols.

Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols on the label, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.

###### §§ 5.127-5.128 [Reserved]

###### § 5.129 Health-related statements.

(a)When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:

(1)means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required under part 16 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits product, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (for example, statements of vitamin content).

(2)means a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a disease or health-related condition.

(3)means a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.

(b)&#x2014;(1)In general, distilled spirits may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.

(2)(i) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on the distilled spirits. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on the distilled spirits.

(ii) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; is sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.

(3)A health-related directional statement is presumed misleading unless it:

(i) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and

(ii)(A) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or

(B) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.

###### § 5.130 Appearance of endorsement.

(a)Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not include the name, or the simulation or abbreviation of the name, of any living individual of public prominence, or an existing private or public organization, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of the individual or organization, if its use is likely to lead a consumer to falsely believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization. This section does not prohibit the use of such names where the individual or organization has provided authorization for their use.

(b)Statements or other representations do not violate this section if, taken as a whole, they create no misleading impression as to an implied endorsement either because of the context in which they are presented or because of the use of an adequate disclaimer.

(c)This section does not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier (processor), blender, or other producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of distilled spirits. This section also does not apply to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by the industry member or its predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.

##### Subpart I - Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits

###### § 5.141 The standards of identity in general.

(a)Distilled spirits are divided, for labeling purposes, into classes, which are further divided into specific types. As set forth in § 5.63, a distilled spirits product label must bear the appropriate class, type or other designation. The standards that define the classes and types are known as the “standards of identity.” The classes and types of distilled spirits set forth in this subpart apply only to distilled spirits for beverage or other nonindustrial purposes.

(b)(1) Unless otherwise specified, when a standard of identity states that a mash is of a particular ingredient (such as “fermented mash of grain”), the mash must be made entirely of that ingredient without the addition of other fermentable ingredients.

(2) Some distilled spirits products may conform to the standards of identity of more than one class. Such products may be designated with any single class designation defined in this subpart to which the products conform.

(c)If a product is designated with both the class and the type, the type designation must be as conspicuous as the class designation, and must appear in the same field of vision.

(d)All words in a designation must be similarly conspicuous and must appear together.

###### § 5.142 Neutral spirits or alcohol.

(a)“Neutral spirits” or “alcohol” are distilled spirits distilled from any suitable material at or above 95 percent alcohol by volume (190&#xB0; proof), and, if bottled, bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof). Neutral spirits other than the type “grain spirits” may be designated as “neutral spirits” or “alcohol” on a label. Neutral spirits (other than the type “grain spirits”) may not be aged in wood barrels at any time.

(b)The following chart lists the types of neutral spirits and the rules that apply to the type designation.

###### § 5.143 Whisky.

(a)“Whisky” or “whiskey” is distilled spirits that is an alcoholic distillate from a fermented mash of any grain distilled at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190&#xB0; proof) having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to whisky, stored in oak barrels (except that corn whisky need not be so stored), and bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof), and also includes mixtures of such distillates for which no specific standards of identity are prescribed.

(b)The word whisky may be spelled as either “whisky” or “whiskey”. The place, State, or region where the whisky was distilled may appear as part of the designation on the label if the distillation and any required aging took place in that location (“New York Bourbon Whisky” must be distilled and aged in the State of New York); however, blending and bottling need not have taken place in the same place, State, or region. However, if any whisky is made partially from whisky distilled in a country other than that indicated by the type designation, the label must indicate the percentage of such whisky and the country where that whisky was distilled. Additionally, the label of whisky that does not meet one of the standards for specific types of whisky and that is comprised of components distilled in more than one country must contain a statement of composition indicating the country of origin of each component (such as “Whisky&#x2014;50% from Japan, 50% from the United States”). The word “bourbon” may not be used to describe any whisky or whisky-based distilled spirits not distilled and aged in the United States. The whiskies defined in paragraphs (c)(2) through (6) and (10) through (14) of this section are distinctive products of the United States and must have the country of origin stated immediately adjacent to the type designation if it is distilled outside of the United States, or the whisky designation must be proceeded by the term “American type” if the country of origin appears elsewhere on the label. For example, “Brazilian Corn Whisky,” “Rye Whisky distilled in Sweden,” and “Blended Whisky&#x2014;Product of Japan” are statements that meet this country of origin requirement. “Light whisky”, “Blended light whisky”, and “Whisky distilled from bourbon (rye, wheat, malt, rye malt, or other named grain) mash” may only be produced in the United States.

(c)The following tables set out the designations for whisky. Table 1 sets forth the standards for whisky that are defined based on production, storage, and processing standards, while Table 2 sets forth rules for the types of whisky that are defined as distinctive products of certain foreign countries. For the whiskies listed in Table 1, a domestic whisky may be labeled with the designation listed, when it complies with the production standards in the subsequent columns. The “source” column indicates the source of the grain mash used to make the whisky. The “distillation proof” indicates the allowable distillation proof for that type. The “storage” column indicates the type of packages (barrels) in which the spirits must be stored and limits for the proof of the spirits when entering the packages. The “neutral spirits permitted” column indicates whether neutral spirits may be used in the product in their original state (and not as vehicles for flavoring materials), and if so, how much may be used. The “harmless coloring, flavoring, blending materials permitted” column indicates whether harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials, other than neutral spirits in their original form, described in § 5.142, may be used in the product. The use of the word “straight” is a further designation of a type, and is optional.

###### § 5.144 Gin.

(a)“Gin” is distilled spirits made by original distillation from mash, or by redistillation of distilled spirits, or by mixing neutral spirits, with or over juniper berries and, optionally, with or over other aromatics, or with or over extracts derived from infusions, percolations, or maceration of such materials, and includes mixtures of gin and neutral spirits. It must derive its main characteristic flavor from juniper berries and be bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof). Gin may be aged in oak containers.

(b)Gin made exclusively by original distillation or by redistillation may be further designated as “distilled,” “Dry,” “London,” “Old Tom” or some combination of these four terms.

###### § 5.145 Brandy.

(a)“Brandy” is spirits that are distilled from the fermented juice, mash, or wine of fruit, or from the residue thereof, distilled at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190&#xB0; proof) having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to the product, and bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof).

(b)Brandy conforming to one of the type designations must be designated with the type name or specific designation specified in the requirements for that type. The term “brandy” without further qualification (such as “peach” or “marc”) may only be used as a designation on labels of grape brandy as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Brandy conforming to one of the type designations defined in paragraphs (c)(1) through (13) of this section must be designated on the label with the type name unless a specific designation is included in the requirements for that type. Brandy, or mixtures thereof, not conforming to any of the types defined in this section must be designated on the label as “brandy” followed immediately by a truthful and adequate statement of composition.

(c)Paragraphs (c)(1) through (13) of this section set out the types of brandy and the standards for each type.

###### § 5.146 Blended applejack.

(a)“Blended applejack” is a mixture containing at least 20 percent on a proof gallon basis of apple brandy (applejack) that has been stored in oak barrels for not less than 2 years, and not more than 80 percent of neutral spirits on a proof gallon basis. Blended applejack must be bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof).

(b)The label designation for blended applejack may be “blended applejack” or “applejack&#x2013;a blend.”

###### § 5.147 Rum.

(a)“Rum” is distilled spirits that is distilled from the fermented juice of sugar cane, sugar cane syrup, sugar cane molasses, or other sugar cane by-products at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190&#xB0; proof) having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to rum, and bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof); and also includes mixtures solely of such spirits. All rum may be designated as “rum” on the label, even if it also meets the standards for a specific type of rum.

(b)Paragraph (b)(1) of this section describes a specific type of rum and the standards for that type.

###### § 5.148 Agave spirits.

(a)“Agave spirits” are distilled from a fermented mash, of which at least 51 percent is derived from plant species in the genus Agave and up to 49 percent is derived from other sugars. Agave spirits must be distilled at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190&#xB0; proof) and bottled at or above 40 percent alcohol by volume (80&#xB0; proof). Agave spirits may be stored in wood barrels. Agave spirits may contain added flavoring or coloring materials as authorized by § 5.155. This class also includes mixtures of agave spirits. Agave spirits that meet the standard of identity for “Tequila” or “Mezcal” may be designated as “agave spirits,” or as “Tequila” or “Mezcal”, as applicable.

(b)Paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section describe the types of agave spirits and the rules for each type.

###### § 5.149 [Reserved]

###### § 5.150 Cordials and liqueurs.

(a)Cordials and liqueurs are flavored distilled spirits that are made by mixing or redistilling distilled spirits with or over fruits, flowers, plants, or pure juices therefrom, or other natural flavoring materials, or with extracts derived from infusions, percolation, or maceration of such materials, and containing sugar (such as sucrose, fructose, dextrose, or levulose) in an amount of not less than 2.5 percent by weight of the finished product. Designations on labels may be “Cordial” or “Liqueur,” or, in the alternative, may be one of the type designations below. Cordials and liqueurs may not be designated as “straight”. The designation of a cordial or liqueur may include the word “dry” if sugar is less than 10 percent by weight of the finished product.

(b)Paragraph (b)(1) through (12) of this section list definitions and standards for optional type designations.

###### § 5.151 Flavored spirits.

(a)“Flavored spirits” are distilled spirits that are spirits conforming to one of the standards of identity set forth in §§ 5.142 through 5.148 to which have been added nonbeverage natural flavors, wine, or nonalcoholic natural flavoring materials, with or without the addition of sugar, and bottled at not less than 30 percent alcohol by volume (60&#xB0; proof). The flavored spirits must be specifically designated by the single base spirit and one or more of the most predominant flavors (for example, “Pineapple Flavored Tequila” or “Cherry Vanilla Flavored Bourbon Whisky”). The base spirit must conform to the standard of identity for that spirit before the flavoring is added. Base spirits that are a distinctive product of a particular place must be manufactured in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country as designated in the base spirit's standard of identity. If the finished product contains more than 2.5 percent by volume of wine, the kinds and percentages by volume of wine must be stated as a part of the designation (whether the wine is added directly to the product or whether it is first mixed into an intermediate product), except that a flavored brandy may contain an additional 12.5 percent by volume of wine, without label disclosure, if the additional wine is derived from the particular fruit corresponding to the labeled flavor of the product.

(b) [Reserved]

###### § 5.152 Imitations.

(a) Imitations must bear, as a part of the designation thereof, the word “imitation” and include the following:

(1) Any class or type of distilled spirits to which has been added coloring or flavoring material of such nature as to cause the resultant product to simulate any other class or type of distilled spirits;

(2) Any class or type of distilled spirits (other than distilled spirits specialty products as defined in § 5.156) to which has been added flavors considered to be artificial or imitation.

(3) Any class or type of distilled spirits (except cordials, liqueurs and specialties marketed under labels which do not indicate or imply that a particular class or type of distilled spirits was used in the manufacture thereof) to which has been added any whisky essence, brandy essence, rum essence, or similar essence or extract which simulates or enhances, or is used by the trade or in the particular product to simulate or enhance, the characteristics of any class or type of distilled spirits;

(4) Any type of whisky to which beading oil has been added;

(5) Any rum to which neutral spirits or distilled spirits other than rum have been added;

(6) Any brandy made from distilling material to which has been added any amount of sugar other than the kind and amount of sugar expressly authorized in the production of standard wine; and

(7) Any brandy to which neutral spirits or distilled spirits other than brandy have been added, except that this provision shall not apply to any product conforming to the standard of identity for blended applejack.

(b) If any of the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section apply, the “Imitation” class designation must be used in front of the appropriate class as part of the designation (for example, Imitation Whisky).

###### § 5.153 [Reserved]

###### § 5.154 Rules for geographical designations.

(a)(1) Geographical names for distinctive types of distilled spirits (other than names found by the appropriate TTB officer under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to have become generic) may not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other place than the particular region indicated by the name, unless:

(i) There appears the word “type” or the word “American” or some other adjective indicating the true place of production, in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name; and

(ii) The distilled spirits to which the name is applied conform to the distilled spirits of that particular region. The following are examples of distinctive types of distilled spirits with geographical names that have not become generic: Eau de Vie de Dantzig (Danziger Goldwasser), Ojen, Swedish punch. Geographical names for distinctive types of distilled spirits may be used to designate only distilled spirits conforming to the standard of identity, if any, for such type specified in this section, or if no such standard is so specified, then in accordance with the trade understanding of that distinctive type.

(2) Only such geographical names for distilled spirits as the appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common knowledge lost their geographical significance to such extent that they have become generic shall be deemed to have become generic. Examples are London dry gin, Geneva (Hollands) gin.

(3) Geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of distilled spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other place than the particular place or region indicated in the name. Examples are Armagnac, Greek brandy, Jamaica rum, Puerto Rico rum, Demerara rum and Andong Soju.

(b)(1) The whiskies of the types specified in paragraphs (c)(2) through (6) and (10) through (14) of § 5.143 are distinctive products of the United States and if produced in a foreign country shall be designated by the applicable designation prescribed in such paragraphs, together with the words “American type” or the words “produced (distilled, blended) in ____”, the blank to be filled in with the name of the foreign country:That the word “bourbon” shall not be used to describe any whisky or whisky-based distilled spirits not produced in the United States. If whisky of any of these types is composed in part of whisky or whiskies produced in a foreign country there shall be stated, on the brand label, the percentage of such whisky and the country of origin thereof.

(2) The name for other distilled spirits which are distinctive products of a particular place or country (such as Habanero), may not be given to the product of any other place or country unless the designation for such product includes the word “type” or an adjective such as “American”, or the like, clearly indicating the true place of production. The provision for place of production shall not apply to designations which by usage and common knowledge have lost their geographical significance to such an extent that the appropriate TTB officer finds they have become generic. Examples of generic designations are Slivovitz, Zubrovka, Aquavit, Arrack, and Kirschwasser.

###### § 5.155 Alteration of class and type.

(a)&#x2014;(1)For the purposes of this section, the term “coloring, flavoring, or blending material” means a harmless substance that is an essential component of the class or type of distilled spirits to which it is added; or a harmless substance, such as caramel, straight malt or straight rye malt whiskies, fruit juices, sugar, infusion of oak chips when approved by the Administrator, or wine, that is not an essential component part of the distilled spirits product to which it is added but which is customarily employed in the product in accordance with established trade usage.

(2)For purposes of this section, the term “certified color” means a color additive that is required to undergo batch certification in accordance with part 74 or part 82 of the Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR parts 74 and 82). An example of a certified color is FD&C Blue No. 2.

(b)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following may be added to distilled spirits without changing the class or type designation:

(1) Coloring, flavoring, and blending materials that are essential components of the class or type of distilled spirits to which added;

(2) Coloring, flavoring, and blending materials that are not essential component parts of the distilled spirits to which added, provided that such coloring, flavoring, or blending materials do not total more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product; and

(3) Wine, when added to Canadian whisky in Canada in accordance with the laws and regulations of Canada governing the manufacture of Canadian whisky.

(c)The addition of the following will require a redesignation of the class or type of the distilled spirits product to which added:

(1) Coloring, flavoring, or blending materials that are not essential component parts of the class or type of distilled spirits to which they are added, if such coloring, flavoring, and blending materials total more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product;

(2) Any material, other than caramel, infusion of oak chips, and sugar, added to Cognac brandy;

(3) Any material whatsoever added to neutral spirits or straight whisky, except that vodka may be treated with sugar, in an amount not to exceed two grams per liter, and with citric acid, in an amount not to exceed one gram per liter;

(4) Certified colors, carmine, or cochineal extract;

(5) Any material that would render the product to which it is added an imitation, as defined in § 5.152; or

(6) For products that are required to be stored in oak barrels in accordance with a standard of identity, the storing of the product in an additional barrel made of another type of wood.

(d)The removal of any constituents from a distilled spirits product to such an extent that the product no longer possesses the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to that class or type of distilled spirits will alter the class or type of the product, and the resulting product must be redesignated appropriately. In addition, in the case of straight whisky, the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, volatile acids, esters, soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or the removal of more than 25 percent of the soluble color, constitutes an alteration of the class or type of the product and requires a redesignation of the product.

(e)Nothing in this section has the effect of modifying the standards of identity specified in § 5.150 for cordials and liqueurs, and in § 5.151 for flavored spirits, or of authorizing any product defined in § 5.152 to be designated as other than an imitation.

###### § 5.156 Distilled spirits specialty products.

(a)Distilled spirits that do not meet one of the other standards of identity specified in this subpart are distilled spirits specialty products and must be designated in accordance with trade and consumer understanding, or, if no such understanding exists, with a distinctive or fanciful name (which may be the name of a cocktail) appearing in the same field of vision as a statement of composition. The statement of composition and the distinctive or fanciful name serve as the class and type designation for these products. The statement of composition must follow the rules found in § 5.166. A product may not bear a designation which indicates it contains a class or type of distilled spirits unless the distilled spirits therein conform to such class and type.

(b)Products may be designated in accordance with trade and consumer understanding without a statement of composition if the appropriate TTB officer has determined that there is such understanding.

###### §§ 5.157-5.165 [Reserved]

###### § 5.166 Statements of composition.

(a)When a statement of composition is required as part of a designation for a distilled spirits specialty product, the statement must be truthful and adequate.

(b)A statement of the classes and types of distilled spirits used in the manufacture thereof will be deemed a sufficient statement of composition in the case of highballs, cocktails, and similar prepared specialties when the designation adequately indicates to the consumer the general character of the product.

##### Subpart J - Formulas

###### § 5.191 Application.

The requirements of this subpart apply to the following persons:

(a) Proprietors of distilled spirits plants qualified as processors under part 19 of this chapter;

(b) Persons in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico who manufacture distilled spirits products for shipment to the United States. However, the filing of a formula for approval by TTB is only required for those products that will be shipped to the United States; and

(c) Persons who ship Virgin Islands distilled spirits products into the United States.

###### § 5.192 Formula requirements.

(a)An approved formula is required to blend, mix, purify, refine, compound, or treat distilled spirits in a manner that results in a change of class or type of the spirits.

(b)In order to obtain formula approval, a person listed in § 5.191 must file a formula in accordance with the instructions on TTB Form 5100.51, Formula and Process for Domestic and Imported Alcohol Beverages (if filing by paper) or on Formulas Online, if filing electronically. When a product will be made or processed under the same formula at more than one location operated by the distiller or processor, the distiller or processor must identify on the form each place of production or processing by name and address, and by permit number, if applicable, and must ensure that a copy of the approved formula is maintained at each location.

(c)Any approval of a formula will remain in effect until revoked, superseded, or voluntarily surrendered, and if the formula is revoked, superseded, or voluntarily surrendered, any existing qualifying statements on such approval as to the rate of tax or the limited use of alcoholic flavors will be made obsolete.

(d)Any change in an approved formula requires the filing of a new TTB Form 5100.51 for approval of the changed formula. After a changed formula is approved, the filer must surrender the original formula approval to the appropriate TTB officer.

###### § 5.193 Operations requiring formulas.

The following operations change the class or type of distilled spirits and therefore require formula approval under § 5.192:That, TTB may exempt categories of distilled spirits products from specific regulatory formula requirements upon a finding that the filing of a formula is no longer necessary in order to properly classify the finished product:

(a) The compounding of distilled spirits through the mixing of a distilled spirits product with any coloring or flavoring material, wine, or other material containing distilled spirits, unless TTB has issued public guidance recognizing that such ingredients are harmless coloring, flavoring or blending materials that do not alter the class or type pursuant to the standards set forth in § 5.155;

(b) The manufacture of an intermediate product to be used exclusively in other distilled spirits products on bonded premises;

(c) Any filtering or stabilizing process that results in a distilled spirits product's no longer possessing the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to the class or type of distilled spirits before the filtering or stabilizing, or, in the case of straight whisky, that results in the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, volatile acids, esters, soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or more than 25 percent of the soluble color;

(d) The mingling of spirits that differ in class or in type of materials from which made;

(e) The mingling of distilled spirits that were stored in charred cooperage with distilled spirits that were stored in plain or reused cooperage, or the mixing of distilled spirits that have been treated with wood chips with distilled spirits not so treated, or the mixing of distilled spirits that have been subjected to any treatment which changes their character with distilled spirits not subjected to such treatment, unless it is determined by the appropriate TTB officer in each of these cases that the composition of the distilled spirits is the same notwithstanding the storage in different kinds of cooperage or the treatment of a portion of the spirits;

(f) Except when authorized for production or storage operations by part 19 of this chapter, the use of any physical or chemical process or any apparatus that accelerates the maturing of the distilled spirits;

(g) The steeping or soaking of plant materials, such as fruits, berries, aromatic herbs, roots, or seeds, in distilled spirits or wines at a distilled spirits plant;

(h) The artificial carbonating of distilled spirits;

(i) In Puerto Rico, the blending of distilled spirits with any liquors manufactured outside Puerto Rico;

(j) The production of gin by:

(1) Redistillation, over juniper berries and other natural aromatics or over the extracted oils of such materials, of spirits distilled at or above 190 degrees of proof that are free from impurities, including such spirits recovered by redistillation of imperfect gin spirits; or

(2) Mixing gin with other distilled spirits;

(k) The treatment of gin by:

(1) The addition or abstraction of any substance or material other than pure water after redistillation in a manner that would change its class and type designation; or

(2) The addition of any substance or material other than juniper berries or other natural aromatics or the extracted oils of such materials, or the addition of pure water, before or during redistillation, in a manner that would change its class and type designation; and

(l) The recovery of spirits by redistillation from distilled spirits products containing other alcoholic ingredients and from spirits that have previously been entered for deposit. However, no formula approval is required for spirits redistilled into any type of neutral spirits other than vodka or for spirits redistilled at less than 190 degrees of proof that lack the taste, aroma and other characteristics generally attributed to whisky, brandy, rum, or gin and that are designated as “Spirits” preceded or followed by a word or phrase descriptive of the material from which distilled. Such spirits may not be designated “Spirits Grain” or “Grain Spirits” on any label.

###### § 5.194 Adoption of predecessor's formulas.

A successor to a person listed in § 5.191 may adopt a predecessor's approved formulas by filing an application with the appropriate TTB officer. The application must include a list of the formulas for adoption and must identify each formula by formula number, name of product, and date of approval. The application must clearly show that the predecessor has authorized the use of the previously approved formulas by the successor.

(2) Any false or misleading statement that explicitly or implicitly disparages a competitor's product. This does not prevent truthful and accurate comparisons between products (such as, “Our liqueur contains more strawberries than Brand X”) or statements of opinion (such as, “We think our rum tastes better than any other distilled spirits on the market”).

(3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.

(4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to analyses, standards or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.

(5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back guarantees are not prohibited.

(6) The words “bond”, “bonded”, “bottled in bond”, “aged in bond”, or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, unless such words or phrases appear, pursuant to § 5.88, on labels of the distilled spirits advertised, and are stated in the advertisement in the manner and form in which they are permitted to appear on the label.

(7) The word “pure” unless:

(i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about the ingredient; or

(ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer from whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or

(iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled the distilled spirits.

(8) The words “double distilled” or “triple distilled” or any similar terms unless it is a truthful statement of fact. For purposes of this paragraph only, a distillation means a single run through a pot still or a single run through a column of a column (reflux) still. The number of distillations may be understated but may not be overstated.

(b)(1) Advertisements shall not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of distilled spirits that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.

(2) Any label depicted on a container in an advertisement shall be a reproduction of an approved label.

(c)The advertisement shall not contain any statement, design, or device directly or by implication concerning age or maturity of any brand or lot of distilled spirits unless a statement of age appears on the label of the advertised product. When any such statement, design, or device concerning age or maturity is contained in any advertisement, it shall include (in direct conjunction therewith and with substantially equal conspicuousness) all parts of the statement, if any, concerning age and percentages required to be made on the label under the provisions of § 5.74. An advertisement for any whisky or brandy (except immature brandies, pomace brandy, marc brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy) which is not required to bear a statement of age on the label or an advertisement for any rum or agave spirits, which has been aged for not less than 4 years may, however, contain inconspicuous, general representations as to age, maturity or other similar representations even though a specific age statement does not appear on the label of the advertised product and in the advertisement itself.

(d)&#x2014;(1)When used in this paragraph (d), terms are defined as follows:

(i)means any statement related to health and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.

(ii)is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a disease or health-related condition.

(iii)is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.

(2)&#x2014;(i)In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.

(ii)A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.

(iii)A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it&#x2014;

(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and

(B)() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or

() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.

(e)The advertisement shall not represent that the distilled spirits were manufactured in or imported from a place or country other than that of their actual origin, or were produced or processed by one who was not in fact the actual producer or processor.

(f)Two or more different brands or lots of distilled spirits shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provisions of this subpart or are in any respect untrue.

(g)Advertisements may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.

(h)Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. “Subliminal or similar techniques,” as used in this subpart, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

(i) Any use of the term “organic” in the advertising of distilled spirits must comply with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules, 7 CFR part 205, as interpreted by the USDA.

###### § 5.236 Comparative advertising.

(a)Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a competitor's product in a manner that is false or misleading.

(b)(1) Taste test results may be used in advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are disparaging in a false or misleading manner; deceptive; or likely to mislead the consumer.

(2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM, 1968, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68&#x2013;15545.

(3) A statement shall appear in the advertisement providing the name and address of the testing administrator.

This prohibition applies to any person, including retailers, holding malt beverages for sale in interstate or foreign commerce or any person holding malt beverages for sale after shipment in interstate or foreign commerce.

(c)Subject to the jurisdictional limits of the FAA Act, as set forth in § 7.4, it is unlawful for any person engaged in business as a brewer, wholesaler, or importer of malt beverages, directly or indirectly, or through an affiliate, to sell or ship, or deliver for sale or shipment, or otherwise introduce or receive in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove from customs custody, any malt beverages in containers unless such containers are marked, branded, labeled, and packaged in conformity with the regulations in this part.

(1) It must bear one or more labels meeting the standards for “labels” set forth in subpart D of this part;

(2) One or more of the labels on the container must include the mandatory information set forth in subpart E of this part;

In accordance with §§ 7.3 and 7.4, malt beverages that are not subject to the COLA requirements of this section may still be subject to the substantive labeling provisions of subparts D through I of this part to the extent that the State into which the malt beverages are being shipped has similar State laws or regulations.

(c)Persons bottling malt beverages that will not be shipped or delivered for sale or shipment in interstate or foreign commerce are not required to obtain a COLA or a certificate of exemption from label approval. (Note: A certificate of exemption from label approval is a certificate issued by TTB to cover a wine or distilled spirits product that will not be sold, offered for sale, shipped, delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce.)

(d)Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, a bottler or importer must provide evidence of label approval for a label used on a container of malt beverages that is subject to the COLA requirements of this part.

(b)Malt beverages, imported in containers, are not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such malt beverages from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the malt beverages has obtained a COLA covering the malt beverages and is able to provide it (either electronically or on paper) upon request. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer.

(c)If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned identification number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the product or lot of malt beverages being imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at the time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.

(d)Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, an importer must provide evidence of label approval for a label used on a container of malt beverages that is subject to the COLA requirements of this part. This requirement may be satisfied by providing original COLAs, photocopies, or electronic copies of COLAs, or records showing the TTB identification number assigned to the approved COLA.

(e)The COLA requirement imposed by this section applies only to malt beverages that are removed for sale or any other commercial purpose. See 27 CFR 27.49, 27.74, and 27.75 for labeling exemptions applicable to certain imported samples of malt beverages.

(f)Containers of malt beverages in customs custody that are required to be covered by a COLA but are not labeled in conformity with a COLA must be relabeled, under the supervision and direction of customs officers, prior to their removal from customs custody for consumption.

(g)Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply only if the laws or regulations of the State in which the malt beverages are withdrawn require that all malt beverages sold or otherwise disposed of in such State be labeled in conformity with the requirements of subparts D through I of this part. A State requires that malt beverages be labeled in conformity with the requirements of subparts D through I of this part when the State has either adopted subparts D through I of this part in their entireties or has adopted requirements identical in effect to those set forth in subparts D through I in this part. In accordance with §§ 7.3 and 7.4, malt beverages that are not subject to the COLA requirements of this section may still be subject to the substantive labeling provisions of subparts D through I of this part to the extent that the State into which the malt beverages are being shipped has similar State law or regulation.

###### § 7.25 Rules regarding certificates of label approval (COLAs) for malt beverages imported in containers.

(a)An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the use of the labels covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA) on containers of malt beverages, as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by the form or otherwise authorized by TTB (such as through the issuance of public guidance available on the TTB website at).

(b)The COLA must be obtained prior to the removal of malt beverages in containers from customs custody for consumption.

(c)The person responsible for the importation of malt beverages must obtain approval of the labels by submitting an application to TTB on Form 5100.31. A person may apply for a COLA either electronically by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, ator by submitting the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of COLAs, see part 13 of this chapter.

###### § 7.27 Presenting certificates of label approval (COLAs) to Government officials.

A certificate holder must present the original or a paper or electronic copy of the appropriate certificate of label approval (COLA) upon the request of any duly authorized representative of the United States Government.

###### § 7.28 Formulas, samples, and documentation.

(a) Prior to or in conjunction with the review of an application for a certificate of label approval (COLA) on TTB Form 5100.31, the appropriate TTB officer may require a bottler or importer to submit a formula, the results of laboratory testing of the malt beverage, or a sample of any malt beverage or ingredients used in producing a malt beverage. After the issuance of a COLA, or with regard to any malt beverage required to be covered by a COLA, the appropriate TTB officer may require a full and accurate statement of the contents of the container.

(b) A formula may be filed electronically by using Formulas Online, or it may be submitted on paper on TTB Form 5100.51. See § 7.11 for more information on forms and Formulas Online.

###### § 7.29 Personalized labels.

(a)Applicants for label approval may obtain permission from TTB to make certain changes in order to personalize labels without having to resubmit labels for TTB approval. A personalized label is an alcohol beverage label that meets the minimum mandatory label requirements and is customized for customers. Personalized labels may contain a personal message, picture, or other artwork that is specific to the consumer who is purchasing the product. For example, a brewer may offer individual or corporate customers labels that commemorate an event such as a wedding or grand opening.

(b)Any person who intends to offer personalized labels must submit a template for the personalized label as part of the application for label approval required under §§ 7.21 or 7.24, and must note on the application a description of the specific personalized information that may change.

(c)If the application complies with the regulations, TTB will issue a certificate of label approval (COLA) with a qualification allowing the personalization of labels. The qualification will allow the certificate holder to add or change items on the personalized label such as salutations, names, graphics, artwork, congratulatory dates and names, or event dates without applying for a new COLA. All of these items on personalized labels must comply with the regulations of this part.

(d)Approval of an application to personalize labels does not authorize the addition of any information that discusses either the alcohol beverage or characteristics of the alcohol beverage or that is inconsistent with or in violation of the provisions of this part or any other applicable provision of law or regulations.

##### Subpart C - Alteration of Labels, Relabeling, and Adding Information to Containers

###### § 7.41 Alteration of labels.

(a)It is unlawful for any person to alter, mutilate, destroy, obliterate or remove any mark, brand, or label on malt beverages in containers held for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or held for sale after shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, except as authorized by §§ 7.42, 7.43, or 7.44, or as otherwise authorized by Federal law.

(b)For purposes of the relabeling activities authorized by this subpart, the term “relabel” includes the alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal of any existing mark, brand, or label on the container, as well as the addition of a new label (such as a sticker that adds information about the product or information engraved on the container) to the container, and the replacement of a label with a new label bearing identical information.

(c)Authorization to relabel under this subpart:

(1) In no way authorizes the placement of labels on containers that do not accurately reflect the brand, bottler, identity, or other characteristics of the product;

(2) Does not relieve the person conducting the relabeling operations from any obligation to comply with the regulations in this part and with State or local law: and,

(3) Does not relieve the person conducting the relabeling operations from any obligation to obtain permission from the owner of the brand where otherwise required.

###### § 7.42 Authorized relabeling activities by brewers and importers.

(a)A brewer may relabel domestically bottled malt beverages prior to removal from, and after return to bond at, the brewery premises, with labels covered by a certificate of label approval (COLA) without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, provided that the brewer is the certificate holder (and bottler).

(b)A brewer may relabel domestically bottled malt beverages (or direct the relabeling of such malt beverages by an authorized agent) after removal from brewery premises with labels covered by a COLA, without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, provided that the brewer is the certificate holder (and bottler).

(c)Under the supervision of U.S. customs officers, imported malt beverages in containers in customs custody may be relabeled without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity. Such containers must bear labels covered by a certificate of label approval (COLA) upon their removal from customs custody for consumption. See § 7.24(b).

(d)The importer of malt beverages in containers may relabel such malt beverages (or direct the relabeling of such malt beverages by an authorized agent) after removal from customs custody without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, as long as the labels are covered by a COLA.

###### § 7.43 Relabeling activities that require separate written authorization from TTB.

(a)Any permittee or brewer holding malt beverages for sale who needs to relabel the containers but is not the original bottler may apply for written permission for the relabeling of malt beverage containers. The appropriate TTB officer may permit relabeling of malt beverages in containers if the facts show that the relabeling is for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of this part or State law, or for the purpose of replacing damaged labels.

(b)The written application must include:

(1) Copies of the original and proposed new labels;

(2) The circumstances of the request, including the reason for relabeling;

(3) The number of containers to be relabeled;

(4) The location where the relabeling will take place; and,

(5) The name and address of the person who will be conducting the relabeling operations.

###### § 7.44 Adding a label or other information to a container that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer.

Any label or other information that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer of the malt beverage may be added to containers (by the addition of stickers, engraving, stenciling, etc.) without prior approval from TTB and without being covered by a certificate of label approval. Such information may be added before or after the containers are removed from brewery premises or released from customs custody. The information added:

(a) May not violate the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part;

(b) May not contain any reference to the characteristics of the product; and

(c) May not be added to the container in such a way that it obscures any other label on the container.

##### Subpart D - Label Standards

###### § 7.51 Requirement for firmly affixed labels.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any label that is not an integral part of the container must be affixed to the container in such a way that it cannot be removed without thorough application of water or other solvents.

(b)The following provisions apply to labels on kegs with a capacity of 5.16 gallons or more that bear mandatory information, as defined by § 7.61(a)(5), and are in the form of a keg collar or tap cover, as defined in § 7.1.

(1) Such keg collars or tap covers are considered to be firmly affixed if removal would break or destroy the keg collar or tap cover in such a way that it cannot be reused.

(2) Such keg collars or tap covers are not required to be firmly affixed, provided that the name of the bottler or importer of the malt beverage, as applicable under §§ 7.66&#x2013;7.68, is permanently or semi-permanently stated on the keg in the form of embossing, engraving, stamping, or through the use of a sticker or ink jet method.

(c) This section in no way affects the requirements of part 16 of this chapter regarding the mandatory health warning statement.

###### § 7.52 Legibility and other requirements for mandatory information on labels.

(a)Mandatory information on labels must be readily legible to potential consumers under ordinary conditions.

(b)Subject to the exceptions below, mandatory information on labels, except brand names, must be separate and apart from any additional information.

(1) This does not preclude the addition of brief optional phrases of additional information as part of the class or type designation (such as “premium malt beverage”), the name and address statement (such as “Proudly brewed and bottled by ABC Brewing Co. in Pittsburgh, PA, for over 30 years”), or other information required by § 7.63(a). The statements required by § 7.63(b) may not include additional information.

(2) Mandatory information (other than an aspartame declaration required by § 7.63(b)(4)) may be contained among other descriptive or explanatory information if the script, type, or printing of the mandatory information is substantially more conspicuous than that of the descriptive or explanatory information.

(c)Mandatory information must appear in a color that contrasts with the background on which it appears, except that if the net contents or the name and address are blown into a glass container, they need not be contrasting. The color of the container and of the malt beverages must be taken into account if the label is transparent or if mandatory label information is etched, engraved, sandblasted, or otherwise carved into the surface of the container or is branded, stenciled, painted, printed, or otherwise directly applied on to the surface of the container. Examples of acceptable contrasts are:

(1) Black lettering appearing on a white or cream background; or

(2) White or cream lettering appearing on a black background.

(d)Except for the aspartame statement when required by § 7.63(b)(4), which must appear in all capital letters, mandatory information may appear in all capital letters, in all lower case letters, or in mixed-case using both capital and lower-case letters.

###### § 7.53 Type size of mandatory information and alcohol content statements.

(a) All capital and lowercase letters in statements of mandatory information on labels must meet the following type size requirements.

(1)&#x2014;All mandatory information (including an alcohol content statement required by § 7.63(a)(3)) must be in script, type, or printing that is at least two millimeters in height.

(2)&#x2014;All mandatory information (including an alcohol content statement required by § 7.63(a)(3)) must be in script, type, or printing that is at least one millimeter in height.

(b)&#x2014;(1)An alcohol content statement, whether required or optional under this part, may not appear in script, type, or printing that is more than four millimeters in height on containers of malt beverages of more than 40 fluid ounces.

(2)An alcohol content statement, whether required or optional under this part, may not appear in script, type, or printing that is more than three millimeters in height on containers of malt beverages of 40 fluid ounces or less.

###### § 7.54 Visibility of mandatory information.

Mandatory information on a label must be readily visible and may not be covered or obscured in whole or in part. See § 7.62 for rules regarding packaging of containers (including cartons, coverings, and cases). See subpart N of this part for regulations pertaining to advertising materials.

###### § 7.55 Language requirements.

(a)Mandatory information must appear in the English language, with the exception of the brand name and except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

(b)Additional statements in a foreign language, including translations of mandatory information that appears elsewhere in English on the label, are allowed on labels and containers as long as they do not in any way conflict with, or contradict, the requirements of this part.

(c)Mandatory information may be stated solely in the Spanish language on labels of malt beverages bottled for consumption within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

###### § 7.56 Additional information.

Information (other than mandatory information) that is truthful, accurate, and specific, and that does not violate subpart F, G, or H of this part, may appear on labels. Such additional information may not conflict with, modify, qualify or restrict mandatory information in any manner.

##### Subpart E - Mandatory Label Information

###### § 7.61 What constitutes a label for purposes of mandatory information.

(a)Certain information, as outlined in § 7.63, must appear on a label. When used in this part for purposes of determining where mandatory information must appear, the term “label” includes:

(1) Material affixed to the container, whether made of paper, plastic, metal, or other matter;

(2) For purposes of the net contents statement and the name and address statement only, information blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container;

(3) Information etched, engraved, sandblasted, or otherwise carved into the surface of the container;

(4) Information branded, stenciled, painted, printed, or otherwise directly applied on to the surface of the container; and

(5) Information on a keg collar or a tap cover of a keg, only if it includes mandatory information that is not repeated elsewhere on a label firmly affixed to the container and only if it meets the requirements of § 7.51.

(b)Information appearing on the following parts of the container is subject to all of the restrictions and prohibitions set forth in subparts F, G, and H of this part, but will not satisfy any requirements in this part for mandatory information that must appear on labels:

(1) Material affixed to, or information appearing on, the bottom surface of the container;

(2) Caps, corks, or other closures unless authorized to bear mandatory information by the appropriate TTB officer; and

(3) Foil or heat shrink bottle capsules.

(c)Any materials that accompany the container to the consumer but are not firmly affixed to the container, including booklets, leaflets, and hang tags, are not “labels” for purposes of this part. Such materials are instead subject to the advertising regulations in subpart N of this part.

###### § 7.62 Packaging (cartons, coverings, and cases).

(a)The term “packaging” includes any covering, carton, case, carrier, or other packaging of malt beverage containers used for sale at retail, but does not include shipping cartons or cases that are not intended to accompany the container to the consumer.

(b)Any packaging of malt beverage containers may not contain any statement, design, device, or graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation that is prohibited on labels by regulations in subpart F, G, or H of this part.

(c)The following requirements apply to optional information on packaging.

(1) The packaging may display any information that is not in conflict with the labeling on the container or containers within the packaging.

(2) If the packaging displays a brand name, it must display the brand name in its entirety. For example, if a brand name is required to be modified with additional information on the container or containers within the packaging, the packaging must also display the same modifying language.

(3) If the packaging displays a class or type designation it must be identical to the class or type designation appearing on the container or containers within the packaging. For example, if the packaging displays a class or type designation for a specialty product for which a statement of composition is required on the container, the packaging must include the statement of composition as well.

(d)The container or containers within the packaging are subject to all labeling requirements of this part, including mandatory labeling information requirements, regardless of whether the packaging bears such information.

###### § 7.63 Mandatory label information.

(a)Malt beverage containers must bear a label or labels (as defined in § 7.61(a)) containing the following information:

(1) Brand name, in accordance with § 7.64;

(2) Class, type, or other designation, in accordance with subpart I of this part;

(3) Alcohol content, in accordance with § 7.65, for malt beverages that contain any alcohol derived from added nonbeverage flavors or other added nonbeverage ingredients (other than hops extract) containing alcohol;

(4) Name and address of the bottler or importer (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container), in accordance with § 7.66, 7.67, or 7.68, as applicable; and

(5) Net contents (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container), in accordance with § 7.70.

(b)Certain ingredients must be declared on a label without the inclusion of any additional information as part of the statement as follows:

(1)If a malt beverage contains the coloring material FD&C Yellow No. 5, the label must include a statement to that effect, such as “FD&C Yellow No. 5” or “Contains FD&C Yellow No. 5.”

(2)If a malt beverage contains the color additive cochineal extract or the color additive carmine, the label must include a statement to that effect, using the respective common or usual name (such as, “contains cochineal extract” or “contains carmine”). This requirement applies to labels when either of the coloring materials is used in a malt beverage that is removed from bottling premises or from customs custody on or after April 16, 2013.

(3)If a malt beverage contains 10 or more parts per million of sulfur dioxide or other sulfiting agent(s) measured as total sulfur dioxide, the label must include a statement to that effect. Examples of acceptable statements are “Contains sulfites” or “Contains (a) sulfiting agent(s)” or a statement identifying the specific sulfiting agent. The alternative terms “sulphites” or “sulphiting” may be used.

(4)If the malt beverage contains aspartame, the label must include the following statement, in capital letters, separate and apart from all other information: “PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.”

###### § 7.64 Brand name.

(a)The malt beverage label must include a brand name. If the malt beverage is not sold under a brand name, then the name of the bottler or importer, as applicable, appearing in the name and address statement is treated as the brand name.

(b)Labels may not include any misleading brand names. A brand name is misleading if it creates (by itself or in association with other printed or graphic matter) any erroneous impression or inference as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the malt beverage. A brand name that would otherwise be misleading may be qualified with the word “brand” or with some other qualification if the appropriate TTB officer determines that the qualification dispels any misleading impression that might otherwise be created.

###### § 7.65 Alcohol content.

(a)Alcohol content and the percentage and quantity of the original gravity or extract may be stated on any malt beverage label, unless prohibited by State law. When alcohol content is stated, and the manner of statement is not required under State law, it must be stated as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b)The following rules apply to both mandatory and optional statements of alcohol content.

(1) A statement of alcohol content must be expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume. Other truthful, accurate, and specific factual representations of alcohol content, such as alcohol by weight, may be made, as long as they appear together with, and as part of, the statement of alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume.

(2) For malt beverages containing one half of one percent (0.5 percent) or more alcohol by volume, statements of alcohol content must be expressed to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage point, subject to the tolerance permitted by paragraph (c) of this section. For malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, alcohol content may be expressed either to the nearest one-tenth or the nearest one-hundredth of a percentage point, and such statements are not subject to any tolerance. See paragraph (e) of this section for the rules applicable to such statements.

(3)(i) The alcohol content statement must be expressed in one of the following formats:

(A) “Alcohol percent by volume”;

(B) “percent alcohol by volume”; or

(C) “Alcohol by volume: percent.”

(ii) Any of the words or symbols may be enclosed in parentheses and authorized abbreviations may be used with or without a period. The alcohol content statement does not have to appear with quotation marks.

(4) The statements listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section must appear as shown, except that the following abbreviations may be used: Alcohol may be abbreviated as “alc”; percent may be represented by the percent symbol “%”; alcohol and volume may be separated by a slash “/” in lieu of the word “by”; and volume may be abbreviated as “vol”.

(5)The following are examples of alcohol content statements that comply with the requirements of this part:

(i) “4.2% alc/vol”;

(ii) “Alc. 4.0 percent by vol.”;

(iii) “Alc 4% by vol”; and

(iv) “5.9% Alcohol by Volume.”

(c)Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, a tolerance of 0.3 percentage points will be permitted, either above or below the stated alcohol content, for malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume. However, any malt beverage that is labeled as containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume may not contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, regardless of any tolerance. The tolerance provided by this paragraph does not apply in determining compliance with the provisions of § 7.5 regarding the percentage of alcohol derived from added nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.

(d)The terms “low alcohol” or “reduced alcohol” may be used only on labels of malt beverages containing less than 2.5 percent alcohol by volume. The actual alcohol content may not equal or exceed 2.5 percent alcohol by volume, regardless of any tolerance permitted by paragraph (c) of this section.

(e)The term “non-alcoholic” may be used on labels of malt beverages only if the statement “contains less than 0.5 percent (or .5%) alcohol by volume” appears immediately adjacent to it, in readily legible printing, and on a completely contrasting background. No tolerances are permitted for malt beverages labeled as “non-alcoholic” and containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. A malt beverage may not be labeled with an alcohol content of 0.0 percent alcohol by volume, unless it is also labeled as “alcohol free” in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, and contains no alcohol.

(f)The term “alcohol free” may be used only on malt beverages containing no alcohol. No tolerances are permitted for “alcohol free” malt beverages.

###### § 7.66 Name and address for domestically bottled malt beverages that were wholly fermented in the United States.

(a)Domestically bottled malt beverages that were wholly fermented in the United States and contain no imported malt beverages must be labeled in accordance with this section. (See §§ 7.67 and 7.68 for name and address requirements applicable to malt beverages that are not wholly fermented in the United States.)

(b)A label on the container must state the name and address of the bottler, in accordance with the rules set forth in this section.

(c)The address consists of the city and State and must be consistent with the information reflected on the brewer's notice required under part 25 of this chapter. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.

(d)The bottler may, but is not required to, be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person, such as “bottled by,” “canned by,” “packed by,” or “filled by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler. If one person performs more than one function, the label may so indicate (for example, “brewed and bottled by XYZ Brewery.”) If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person. The appropriate TTB officer may require specific information about the functions performed if necessary to prevent a misleading impression on the label.

(e)The bottler's principal place of business may be shown in lieu of the actual place where the malt beverage was bottled if the address shown is a location where a bottling operation takes place. The appropriate TTB officer may disapprove the listing of a principal place of business if its use would create a false or misleading impression as to the geographic origin of the malt beverage. See 27 CFR 25.141 and 25.142 for coding requirements applicable in these circumstances.

(f)If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, the place where the malt beverage is bottled within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section may be shown in one of the following two ways:

(1)The place where the malt beverage is bottled may be shown as the only location on the label; or

(2)The place where the malt beverage is bottled may appear in a listing of the locations of breweries owned by that person if the place of bottling is not given less emphasis than any of the other locations. See 27 CFR 25.141 and 25.142 for coding requirements applicable in these circumstances.

(g)(1) If malt beverages are bottled for another person, the label may state, in addition to (but not in lieu of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words “brewed and bottled for” or “bottled for” or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract brewing).

(2) If the same brand of malt beverage is brewed and bottled by two or more breweries that are not under the same ownership, the label for each brewery may set forth all the locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.

(h)The name of the person appearing on the label may be the trade name or the operating name, as long as it is identical to a trade or operating name appearing on the brewer's notice.

###### § 7.67 Name and address for domestically bottled malt beverages that were bottled after importation.

(a)This section applies to domestically bottled malt beverages that were bottled after importation. See § 7.68 for name and address requirements applicable to imported malt beverages that are imported in a container. See 19 CFR parts 102 and 134 for U.S. Customs and Border Protection country of origin marking requirements.

(b)Malt beverages that were subject, after importation, to blending or other production may not bear an “imported by” statement on the label, but must instead be labeled in accordance with the rules set forth in § 7.66 with regard to mandatory and optional labeling statements.

(c)The label on malt beverages that are bottled without being subject to blending or other production activities in the United States after the malt beverages were imported must state the words “imported by” or a similar appropriate phrase, followed by the name and address of the importer. The label must also state the words “bottled by” or “packed by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler, except that the following phrases are acceptable in lieu of the name and address of the bottler under the circumstances set forth below:

(1) If the malt beverages were bottled for the person responsible for the importation, the words “imported and bottled (canned, packed or filled) in the United States for” (or a similar appropriate phrase) followed by the name and address of the principal place of business in the United States of the person responsible for the importation;

(2) If the malt beverages were bottled by the person responsible for the importation, the words “imported and bottled (canned, packed or filled) in the United States by” (or a similar appropriate phrase) followed by the name and address of the principal place of business in the United States of the person responsible for the importation;

(3) In the situations set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the address shown on the label may be that of the principal place of business of the importer who is also the bottler, provided that the address shown is a location where bottling takes place.

(d)A trade name may be used if the trade name is listed on the importer's basic permit.

###### § 7.68 Name and address for malt beverages that are imported in a container.

(a)This section applies to malt beverages that are imported in a container, as defined in § 7.1. See § 7.67 for rules regarding name and address requirements applicable to malt beverages that are domestically bottled after importation. See 19 CFR parts 102 and 134 for U.S. Customs and Border Protection country of origin marking requirements.

(b)The label on malt beverages imported in containers, as defined in § 7.1, must state the words “imported by” or a similar appropriate phrase, followed by the name and address of the importer.

(1) For purposes of this section, the importer is the holder of the importer's basic permit that either makes the original customs entry or is the person for whom such entry is made, or the holder of the importer's basic permit that is the agent, distributor, or franchise holder for the particular brand of imported alcohol beverages and that places the order abroad.

(2) The address of the importer must be stated as the city and State of the principal place of business and must be consistent with the address reflected on the importer's basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.

###### § 7.69 Country of origin.

For U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rules regarding country of origin marking requirements, see the CBP regulations at 19 CFR parts 102 and 134.

###### § 7.70 Net contents.

The following rules apply to the net contents statement required by § 7.63.

(a) The volume of malt beverage in the container must appear on a label as a net contents statement using the following measures:

(b)(1) A statement or representation is prohibited, irrespective of falsity, if it directly creates a misleading impression or if it does so indirectly through ambiguity, omission, inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific, or technical matter. For example, an otherwise truthful statement may be misleading because of the omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.

(2) All claims, whether implicit or explicit, must have a reasonable basis in fact. Any claim on malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging that does not have a reasonable basis in fact or cannot be adequately substantiated upon the request of the appropriate TTB officer is considered misleading.

###### § 7.123 Guarantees.

An example of a misleading statement is “tested and approved by our research laboratories” if the testing and approval does not in fact have any significance.

###### § 7.126 Depictions of government symbols.

Malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols on the label, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.

###### § 7.127 [Reserved]

###### § 7.129 Health-related statements.

(a)When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:

(1)means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required under part 16 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, a malt beverage, or any substance found within the malt beverage product, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the alcohol beverage product, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (for example, statements of vitamin content). Numerical statements of the calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content of the product do not constitute claims of nutritional value.

(2)means a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.

(3)means a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption.

(b)&#x2014;(1)In general, malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.

(2)(i) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as needed on the use of specific health claims on labels, containers, or packaging. If FDA determines that the use of such a claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on the malt beverage label.

(ii) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; is sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.

(3)A health-related directional statement is presumed misleading unless it:

(i) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and

(ii)(A) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons”; or

(B) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.

###### § 7.130 Appearance of endorsement.

(a)Malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not include the name, or the simulation or abbreviation of the name, of any living individual of public prominence or an existing private or public organization, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of the individual or organization if its use is likely to lead a consumer to falsely believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization. This section does not prohibit the use of such names where the individual or organization has provided authorization for their use.

(b)Statements or other representations do not violate this section if, taken as a whole, they create no misleading impression as to an implied endorsement either because of the context in which they are presented or because of the use of an adequate disclaimer.

(c)This section does not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, importer, bottler, packer, wholesaler, retailer, or warehouseman, of malt beverages. This section also does not apply to the use by any industry member of a trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by the industry member or its predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.

###### § 7.131 [Reserved]

###### § 7.132 [Reserved]

##### Subpart I - Classes and Types of Malt Beverages

###### § 7.141 Class and type.

(a)The class of the malt beverage must be stated on the label (see § 7.63). The type of the malt beverage may be stated, but is not required to appear on the label. Statements of class and type must conform to the designation of the product as known to the trade. All parts of the designation must appear together.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A malt beverage specialty product is a malt beverage that does not fall under any of the class designations set forth in §§ 7.142 through 7.144 and is not known to the trade under a particular designation, usually because of the addition of ingredients such as colorings, flavorings, or food materials or the use of certain types of production processes where the appropriate TTB officer has not determined that such ingredients or processes are generally recognized as traditional in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor.”

(2)A malt beverage specialty product must be designated with a distinctive or fanciful name, together with a statement of the composition of the product, in accordance with § 7.147. This statement will be considered the class designation for the purposes of this part. All parts of the designation must appear together.

###### § 7.142 Class designations.

The following class designations may be used in accordance with this section:

(a) Any malt beverage, as defined in § 7.1, may be designated simply as a “malt beverage.”

(b)(1) The class designations “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” and “malt liquor” may be used to designate malt beverages that contain at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume and that conform to the trade understanding of those designations. These designations may be preceded or followed by descriptions of the color of the product (such as “amber,” “brown,” “red,” or “golden”) as well as descriptive terms such as “dry,” “export,” “cream,” and “pale.”

(2) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at a comparatively high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to “ale,” “porter,” or “stout” and produced without the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard brewing practices) may bear any of these class designations.

###### § 7.143 Class and type - special rules.

The following special rules apply to specified class and type designations:

(a)Malt beverages that have been concentrated by the removal of water therefrom and reconstituted by the addition of water and carbon dioxide must for the purpose of this part be labeled in the same manner as malt beverages which have not been concentrated and reconstituted, except that there must appear immediately adjacent to, and as a part of, the class designation the statement “PRODUCED FROM____ __CONCENTRATE” (the blank to be filled in with the appropriate class designation). All parts of the class designation must appear in lettering of substantially the same size and kind. However, ice beers, described in paragraph (c) of this section, which are produced by the removal of less than 0.5 percent of the volume of the beer in the form of ice crystals and that retain beer character are not considered concentrated.

(b)No product may be designated with the type designation “half and half” unless it is in fact composed of equal parts of two classes of malt beverages, the names of which are conspicuously stated immediately adjacent to the designation “half and half” (for example, “Half and Half, Porter and Stout”). This does not preclude the use of terms such as “half and half” as part of a distinctive or fanciful name that refers to flavors added to a malt beverage designated in accordance with trade understanding or with a statement of composition.

(c)Malt beverages supercooled during the brewing process to form ice crystals may be labeled with the type designation “ice” preceding the class designation (beer, ale, etc.).

(d)A product composed of two classes of malt beverages may be designated with the type designation “black and tan,” and the class and type designation is the names of the two classes of malt beverages in conjunction with “black and tan” (for example, “Black and Tan, Stout and Ale”).

(e)Any “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” “malt liquor,” or other malt beverage made from a fermentable base that consists of at least 25 percent by weight malted wheat may be designated with the type designation “wheat” preceding the applicable class designation.

(f)Any “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” “malt liquor,” or other malt beverage made from a fermentable base that consists of at least 25 percent by weight malted rye may be designated with the type designation “rye” preceding the applicable class designation.

(g)The term “barley (or wheat or rye) wine ale” or “barley (or wheat or rye) wine style ale” may be used in accordance with trade understanding.

(h)&#x2014;(1)Label designations for malt beverages aged in barrels or with woodchips, spirals, or staves derived from barrels may, but are not required to, include a description of how the product was aged. Thus, for example, acceptable designations for a standard beer aged in an oak barrel would include “beer,” “oak aged beer,” and “beer aged in an oak barrel.”

(2)Malt beverages aged in barrels previously used in the production or storage of wine or distilled spirits, or with woodchips, spirals, or staves derived from barrels previously used in the production or storage of wine or distilled spirits, or from woodchips previously used in the aging of distilled spirits or wine may, but are not required to, include a description of how the product was aged.

(i) Examples of acceptable designations for a standard beer aged in a wine barrel include “beer,” “beer aged in a wine barrel,” and “wine barrel aged beer.”

(ii) Examples of acceptable designations for an ale brewed with honey and aged in a bourbon barrel include “honey ale” and “bourbon barrel aged honey ale” but not simply “ale” or “bourbon barrel aged ale.”

(3)Designations that create a misleading impression as to the identity of the product by emphasizing certain words or terms are prohibited. As set forth in § 7.122, designations may not mislead consumers as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the malt beverage. Examples of designations that would be prohibited under this provision are “bourbon ale,” “bourbon-flavored lager,” “Chardonnay lager,” or “lager with whisky flavors.”

(i)Other type designations (such as “milk” preceding the class designation “stout”) may be applied in conformance with trade understanding.

###### § 7.144 Malt beverages fermented or flavored with certain traditional ingredients.

(a)Any malt beverage that has been fermented or flavored only with one or more ingredients (such as honey or certain fruits) that the appropriate TTB officer has determined are generally recognized as traditional ingredients in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor” may be labeled in accordance with trade understanding following the rules set forth in this section.

(1) A list of such traditional ingredients may be found on the TTB website ().

(2) If the malt beverage has also been fermented or flavored with ingredients that the appropriate TTB officer has not determined are generally recognized as traditional ingredients in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor,” it is a malt beverage specialty and must be labeled in accordance with the statement of composition rules in § 7.147.

(b)(1) A designation in accordance with trade understanding must identify the base product, such as “malt beverage,” “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor” along with a modifier or explanation that provides the consumer with adequate information about the fruit, honey, or other food ingredient used in production of the malt beverage. The label may include additional information about the production process (such as “beer fermented with cherry juice”).

(2) Where more than one exempted ingredient is included, a designation in accordance with trade understanding may identify each ingredient (such as “Ale with cherry juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg”), refer to the ingredients by category (such as “Fruit ale,” “Spiced ale,” or “Ale with natural flavors”), or simply include the ingredient or ingredients that the bottler or importer believes best identify the product (such as “Cherry ale,” “Cinnamon ale,” or “Nutmeg ale”). The designation must distinguish the product from a malt beverage, beer, ale, porter, stout, lager, or malt liquor that is not brewed or flavored with any of these ingredients; thus, unmodified designations such as “beer,” “stout,” or “ale” would not be acceptable.

(c)All parts of the designation must appear together and must be readily legible on a contrasting background. Designations that create a misleading impression as to the identity of the product by emphasizing certain words or terms are prohibited.

###### § 7.145 Malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.

(a) Products containing less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume must bear the class designation “malt beverage,” “cereal beverage,” or “near beer.”

(b) If the designation “near beer” is used, both words must appear in the same size and style of type, in the same color of ink, and on the same background.

(c) No product containing less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume may bear the class designations “beer,” “lager beer,” “lager,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” or any other class or type designation commonly applied to malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or more of alcohol by volume.

###### § 7.146 Geographical names.

(a) Geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages (other than names found under paragraph (b) of this section to have become generic) shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular region indicated by the name unless:

(1) In direct conjunction with the name there appears the word “type” or the word “American”, or some other statement indicating the true place of production in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name; and

(2) The malt beverages to which the name is applied conform to the type so designated. The following are examples of distinctive types of beer with geographical names that have not become generic; Dortmund, Dortmunder, Vienna, Wien, Wiener, Bavarian, Munich, Munchner, Salvator, Kulmbacher, Wurtzburger, Pilsen (Pilsener and Pilsner):That notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, beer which is produced in the United States may be designated as “Pilsen,” “Pilsener,” or “Pilsner” without further modification, if it conforms to such type.

(b) Only such geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages as the appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common knowledge lost their geographical significance to such an extent that they have become generic shall be deemed to have become generic,India Pale Ale.

(c) Except as provided in § 7.64(b), geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of malt beverages shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular place or region indicated in the name.

###### § 7.147 Statement of composition.

(a) A statement of composition is required to appear on the label for malt beverage specialty products, as defined in § 7.141(b), which are not known to the trade under a particular designation. For example, the addition of flavoring materials, colors, or artificial sweeteners may change the class and type of the malt beverage. The statement of composition along with a distinctive or fanciful name serves as the class and type designation for these products.

(b) When required by this part, a statement of composition must contain all of the following information, as applicable:

(1)The statement of composition must clearly identify the base class and/or type designation of the malt beverage product (“beer,” “lager beer,” “lager,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” or “malt beverage”).

(2)The statement of composition must disclose fermentable or non-fermentable flavoring materials added to the malt beverage base class.

(i) If the flavoring material is used before or during the fermentation process, the statement of composition must indicate that the malt beverage was fermented or brewed with the flavoring material (such as “Beer Fermented with grapefruit juice” or “Grapefruit Ale”). If the flavoring material is added after fermentation, the statement of composition must describe that process, using terms such as “added,” “with,” “infused,” or “flavored” (such as “Grapefruit-flavored ale.”).

(ii) If a single flavoring material is used in the production of the malt beverage product, the flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as “Ale Fermented with grapefruit juice”) or generally referenced (such as “Ale with natural flavor”). If two or more flavoring materials are used in the production of the malt beverage, each flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as “lemon juice, kiwi juice” or “lemon and kiwi juice”) or the characterizing flavoring material may be specifically identified and the remaining flavoring materials may be generally referenced (such as “kiwi and other natural and artificial flavor(s)”), or all flavors may be generally referenced (such as “with artificial flavors”).

(3)The statement of composition must disclose the addition of coloring material(s), whether added directly or through flavoring material(s). The coloring materials may be identified specifically (such as “caramel color,” “FD&C Red #40,” “annatto,” etc.) or as a general statement, such as “Contains certified color” for colors approved under 21 CFR subpart 74 or “artificially colored” to indicate the presence of any one or a combination of coloring material(s). However, FD&C Yellow No. 5, carmine, and cochineal extract require specific disclosure in accordance with § 7.63(b)(1) and (2) and that specific disclosure may appear either in the statement of composition or elsewhere in accordance with those sections.

(4)The statement of composition must disclose any artificial sweetener that is added to a malt beverage product, whether the artificial sweetener is added directly or through flavoring material(s). The artificial sweetener may be identified specifically by either generic name or trademarked brand name, or as a general statement (such as “artificially sweetened”) to indicate the presence of any one or combination of artificial sweeteners. However, if aspartame is used, an additional warning statement is required in accordance with § 7.63(b)(4).

##### Subparts J-L [Reserved]

##### Subpart M - Penalties and Compromise of Liability

###### § 7.221 Criminal penalties.

A violation of the labeling provisions of 27 U.S.C. 205(e) is punishable as a misdemeanor. See 27 U.S.C. 207 for the statutory provisions relating to criminal penalties, consent decrees, and injunctions.

###### § 7.222 Conditions of basic permit.

A basic permit is conditioned upon compliance with the requirements of 27 U.S.C. 205, including the labeling and advertising provisions of this part.

###### § 7.232 Definitions.

As used in this subpart, the term “advertisement” or “advertising” includes any written or verbal statement, illustration, or depiction which is in, or calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail, whether it appears in a newspaper, magazine, trade booklet, menu, wine card, leaflet, circular, mailer, book insert, catalog, promotional material, sales pamphlet, internet or other electronic site or social network, or in any written, printed, graphic, or other matter (such as hang tags) accompanying, but not firmly affixed to, the container, representations made on shipping cases, or in any billboard, sign, or other outdoor display, public transit card, other periodical literature, publication, or in a radio or television broadcast, or in any other media; except that such term shall not include:

###### § 7.235 Prohibited practices.

(a)An advertisement of malt beverages must not contain:

(1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression.

(2) Any false or misleading statement that explicitly or implicitly disparages a competitor's product. This does not prevent truthful and accurate comparisons between products (such as “Our ale contains more hops than Brand X”) or statements of opinion (such as “We think our beer tastes better than any other beer on the market”).

(3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.

(6) [Reserved].

(7) [Reserved].

(8) Any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product. Advertisements may include the types of statements that are listed as being not prohibited on labels in § 7.128(b).

(b)(1) Advertisements shall not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of malt beverages that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.

(2) Any label depicted on a container in an advertisement shall be a reproduction of an approved label, except that malt beverage labels not required to be covered by a COLA in accordance with the rules in § 7.21 of this chapter may also appear on advertisements.

(c) [Reserved]

(2) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at comparatively high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to “ale,” “porter,” or “stout” and produced without the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard brewing practices) shall be designated in any advertisement by any of these class designations.

(e)&#x2014;(1)When used in this paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:

(i)means any statement related to health and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.

(ii)is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.

(iii)is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption.

(2)&#x2014;(i)In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.

(ii)A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.

(iii)A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it&#x2014;

(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and

(B)() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or

() Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.

(f)Two or more different brands or lots of malt beverages shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or a newspaper or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provision of this subpart or are in any respect untrue.

(g)Advertisements may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.

(h)Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. “Subliminal or similar techniques,” as used in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

(i)Any use of the term “organic” in the advertising of malt beverages must comply with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules, 7 CFR part 205, as interpreted by the USDA.

###### § 7.236 Comparative advertising.

(a)Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a competitor's product in a manner that is false or misleading.

(b)(1) Taste test results may be used in advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are disparaging in a false or misleading manner, deceptive, or likely to mislead the consumer.

(2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM, 1968, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68&#x2013;15545.

##### Subpart B - Definitions

###### § 8.11 Meaning of terms.

As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires, terms have the meanings given in this section. Any other term defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and used in this part shall have the meaning assigned to it by that Act.

The Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

The Administrator, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.

An officer or employee of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) authorized to perform any functions relating to the administration or enforcement of this part by TTB Order 1135.8, Delegation of the Administrator's Authorities in 27 CFR Part 8, Exclusive Outlets.

Any person engaged in business as a distiller, brewer, rectifier, blender, or other producer, or as an importer or wholesaler, of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages, or as a bottler, or warehouseman and bottler, of distilled spirits; industry member does not include an agency of a State or political subdivision thereof, or an officer or employee of such agency.

Distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages, as defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

Any person engaged in the sale of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages to consumers. A wholesaler who makes incidental retail sales representing less than five percent of the wholesaler's total sales volume for the preceding two-month period shall not be considered a retailer with respect to such incidental sales.

##### Subpart C - Prohibited Practices

###### § 8.21 General.

It is unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or otherwise, that any retailer purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. This prohibition includes purchases coerced by industry members, through acts or threats of physical or economic harm, as well as voluntary industry member-retailer purchase agreements.

###### § 8.22 Contracts to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages.

Any contract or agreement, written or unwritten, which has the effect of requiring the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member beyond a single sales transaction is prohibited. Examples of such contracts are:

(a) An advertising contract between an industry member and a retailer with the express or implied requirement of the purchase of the advertiser's products; or

(b) A sales contract awarded on a competitive bid basis which has the effect of prohibiting the retailer from purchasing from other industry members by:

(1) Requiring that for the period of the agreement, the retailer purchase a product or line of products exclusively from the industry member; or

(2) Requiring that the retailer purchase a specific or minimum quantity during the period of the agreement.

###### § 8.23 Third party arrangements.

Industry member requirements, by agreement or otherwise, with non-retailers which result in a retailer being required to purchase the industry member's products are within the exclusive outlet provisions. These industry member requirements are covered whether the agreement or other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third party. For example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or arrangement contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third party, a ballclub, or municipal or private corporation, not acting as a retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the purchasing decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry member, requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. The business arrangements entered into by the industry member and the third party may consist of such things as sponsoring radio or television broadcasting, paying for advertising, or providing other services or things of value.

##### Subpart D - Exclusion

###### § 8.51 Exclusion, in general.

(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:

(1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) retailer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control over the retailer, and

(2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product.

(b) Section 8.52 lists practices that result in exclusion. Section 8.53 lists practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 8.54 lists the criteria used for determining whether other practices can put retailer independence at risk.

###### § 8.52 Practices which result in exclusion.

The practices specified in this section result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act. The practices specified here are examples and do not constitute a complete list of such practices:

(a) Purchases of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages by a retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member.

(b) Contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another industry member.

###### § 8.53 Practice not resulting in exclusion.

The practice specified in this section is deemed not to result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act: a supply contract for one year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the industry member agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages to the retailer on an “as needed” basis provided that the retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such product.

###### § 8.54 Criteria for determining retailer independence.

The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice, other than those in §§ 8.52 and 8.53, places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to place retailer independence at risk.

(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.

(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.

(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.

(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.

(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.

(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

A petition sent through the U.S. Postal Service should be addressed to: Regulations and Rulings Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 1310 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20220. A petition sent via a private delivery service should be directed to: Regulations and Rulings Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Suite 200E, 1310 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.

(c)The submission of a petition under this subpart is intended to provide TTB with sufficient documentation to propose the establishment of a new AVA or to propose changing the name or boundary of an existing AVA. After considering the petition evidence and any other relevant information, TTB shall decide what action to take in response to a petition and shall so advise the petitioner. Nothing in this chapter shall, or shall be interpreted to, compel any Department of the Treasury official to proceed to rulemaking in response to a submitted petition.

###### § 9.12 AVA petition requirements.

(a)A petition for the establishment of a new AVA must include all of the evidentiary materials and other information specified in this section. The petition must contain sufficient information, data, and evidence such that no independent verification or research is required by TTB.

(1)The name identified for the proposed AVA must be currently and directly associated with an area in which viticulture exists. All of the area within the proposed AVA boundary must be nationally or locally known by the name specified in the petition, although the use of that name may extend beyond the proposed AVA boundary. The name evidence must conform to the following rules:

(i)The petition must completely explain, in narrative form, the manner in which the name is used for the area covered by the proposed AVA.

(ii)The name and the evidence in support of it must come from sources independent of the petitioner. Appropriate name evidence sources include, but are not limited to, historical and modern government or commercial maps, books, newspapers, magazines, tourist and other promotional materials, local business or school names, and road names. Whenever practicable, the petitioner must include with the petition copies of the name evidence materials, appropriately cross-referenced in the petition narrative. Although anecdotal information by itself is not sufficient, statements taken from local residents with knowledge of the name and its use may also be included to support other name evidence.

(2)The petition must explain in detail the basis for defining the boundary of the proposed AVA as set forth in the petition. This explanation must have reference to the name evidence and other distinguishing features information required under this section. In support of the proposed boundary, the petition must outline the commonalities or similarities within that boundary and must explain with specificity how those elements are different in the adjacent areas outside that boundary.

(3)The petition must provide, in narrative form, a description of the common or similar features of the proposed AVA affecting viticulture that make it distinctive. The petition must also explain with specificity in what way these features affect viticulture and how they are distinguished viticulturally from features associated with adjacent areas outside the proposed AVA boundary. For purposes of this section, information relating to distinguishing features affecting viticulture includes the following:

(i)Temperature, precipitation, wind, fog, solar orientation and radiation, and other climate information;

(ii)Underlying formations, landforms, and such geophysical events as earthquakes, eruptions, and major floods;

(iii)Soil series or phases of a soil series, denoting parent material, texture, slope, permeability, soil reaction, drainage, and fertility;

(iv)Flat, hilly, or mountainous topography, geographical formations, bodies of water, watersheds, irrigation resources, and other physical features; and

(v)Minimum and maximum elevations.

(4)&#x2014;(i)The petitioner must submit with the petition, in an appropriate scale, the U.S.G.S. map(s) showing the location of the proposed AVA. The exact boundary of the AVA must be prominently and clearly drawn on the maps without obscuring the underlying features that define the boundary line. U.S.G.S. maps may be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Distribution. If the map name is not known, the petitioner may request a map index by State.

(ii)The petition must include a detailed narrative description of the proposed AVA boundary based on U.S.G.S. map markings. This description must have a specific beginning point, must proceed unbroken from that point in a clockwise direction, and must return to that beginning point to complete the boundary description. The boundary description must refer to easily discernable reference points on the U.S.G.S. maps. The proposed AVA boundary description may rely on any of the following map features:

(A) State, county, township, forest, and other political entity lines;

(B) Highways, roads (including unimproved roads), and trails;

(C) Contour or elevation lines;

(D) Natural geographical features, including rivers, streams, creeks, ridges, and marked elevation points (such as summits or benchmarks);

(E) Human-made features (such as bridges, buildings, windmills, or water tanks); and

(F) Straight lines between marked intersections, human-made features, or other map points.

(b)If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA entirely within, or overlapping, an existing AVA, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information that both identifies the attributes of the proposed AVA that are consistent with the existing AVA and explains how the proposed AVA is sufficiently distinct from the existing AVA and therefore appropriate for separate recognition. If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA that is larger than, and encompasses, all of one or more existing AVAs, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information addressing whether, and to what extent, the attributes of the proposed AVA are consistent with those of the existing AVA(s). In any case in which an AVA would be created entirely within another AVA, whether by the establishment of a new, larger AVA or by the establishment of a new AVA within an existing one, the petition must explain why establishment of the AVA is acceptable. When a smaller AVA has name recognition and features that so clearly distinguish it from a larger AVA that surrounds it, TTB may determine in the course of the rulemaking that it is not part of the larger AVA and that wine produced from grapes grown within the smaller AVA would not be entitled to use the name of the larger AVA as an appellation of origin or in a brand name.

(c)&#x2014;(1)If a petition seeks to change the boundary of an existing AVA, the petitioner must include with the petition all relevant evidence and other information specified for a new AVA petition in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. This evidence or information must include, at a minimum, the following:

(i)If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing boundary, the petition must show how the name of the existing AVA also applies to the expansion area. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain, if so, the extent to which the AVA name does not apply to the excluded area.

(ii)The petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the proposed change has, or does not have, distinguishing features affecting viticulture that are essentially the same as those of the existing AVA. If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing AVA, the petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the expansion has the same distinguishing features as those of the existing AVA and has different features from those of the area outside the proposed, new boundary. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain how the distinguishing features of the excluded area are different from those within the boundary of the smaller AVA. In all cases the distinguishing features must affect viticulture.

(iii)The petition must explain how the boundary of the existing AVA was incorrectly or incompletely defined or is no longer accurate due to new evidence or changed circumstances, with reference to the name evidence and distinguishing features of the existing AVA and of the area affected by the proposed boundary change. The petition must include the appropriate U.S.G.S. maps with the proposed boundary change drawn on them and must provide a detailed narrative description of the changed boundary.

(2)If a petition seeks to change the name of an existing AVA, the petition must establish the suitability of that name change by providing the name evidence specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

###### § 9.13 Initial processing of AVA petitions.

(a)The appropriate TTB officer will acknowledge receipt of a submitted petition. This notification will be in a letter sent to the petitioner within 30 days of receipt of the petition.

(b)The appropriate TTB officer will perform an initial review of the petition to determine whether it is a perfected petition. If the petition is not perfected, the appropriate TTB officer will return it to the petitioner without prejudice to resubmission in perfected form. If the petition is perfected, TTB will decide whether to proceed with rulemaking under § 9.14 and will advise the petitioner in writing of that decision. If TTB decides to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the petitioner of the date of receipt of the perfected petition. If TTB decides not to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the petitioner of the reasons for that decision.

(c)When a perfected petition is accepted for rulemaking, TTB will place a notice to that effect on the TTB Web site.

###### § 9.14 AVA rulemaking process.

(a)If TTB determines that rulemaking in response to a petition is appropriate, TTB will prepare and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in theto solicit public comments on the petitioned-for AVA action.

(b)Following the close of the NPRM comment period, TTB will review any submitted comments and any other available relevant information and will take one of the following actions:

(1) Prepare a final rule for publication in theadopting the proposed AVA action, with or without changes;

(2) Prepare a notice for publication in thewithdrawing the proposal and setting forth the reasons for the withdrawal. Reasons for withdrawal of a proposal must include at least one of the following:

(i) The extent of viticulture within the proposed boundary is not sufficient to constitute a grape-growing region as specified in § 9.11(a); or

(ii) The name, boundary, or distinguishing features evidence does not meet the standards for such evidence set forth in § 9.12; or

(iii) The petitioned-for action would be inconsistent with one of the purposes of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act or any other Federal statute or regulation or would be otherwise contrary to the public interest;

(3) Prepare a new NPRM for publication in thesetting forth a modified AVA action for public comment; or

(4) Take any other action deemed appropriate by TTB as authorized by law.

##### Subpart B - Definitions

###### § 10.11 Meaning of terms.

As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires, terms have the meanings given in this section. Any other term defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and used in this part shall have the meaning assigned to it by that Act.

The Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

The Administrator, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.

An officer or employee of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) authorized to perform any functions relating to the administration or enforcement of this part by TTB Order 1135.10, Delegation of the Administrator's Authorities in 27 CFR Part 10, Commercial Bribery.

Any person engaged in business as a distiller, brewer, recitifier, blender, or other producer, or as an importer or wholesaler of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages, or as a bottler, or warehouseman and bottler, of distilled spirits; industry member does not include an agency of a State or political subdivision thereof, or an officer or employee of such agency.

All corporate executives, including presidents, vice presidents, treasurers, and chief executive officers.

Distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages, as defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

Any person who is a wholesaler or retailer of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages.

##### Subpart C - Commercial Bribery

###### § 10.21 Commercial bribery.

It is unlawful for an industry member, directly or indirectly or through an affiliate, to induce a trade buyer to purchase the industry member's products, to the complete or partial exclusion of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, by offering or giving a bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value to any officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer. The bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value need not be offered or given for the purpose of directly inducing a trade buyer to purchase from the seller, but rather is applicable if an industry member induces officers, employees or representatives of the trade buyer to promote sales of the industry member's products and thereby indirectly induces the trade buyer to purchase from the industry member.

###### § 10.22 Employee associations.

Gifts, donations, and other payments such as for advertising in publications, by an industry member, to trade buyer employee associations are considered the same as bonuses, premiums, compensation, or other things of value given directly to the employees, since the benefits resulting from the gifts or payments flow to the individual members of the association.

###### § 10.23 Gifts or payments to wholesalers.

Although industry members are not prohibited from offering or giving money or other things of value to a wholesale entity (, the corporation, partnership, or individual who owns the business), the wholesaler will be considered as acting as a mere conduit between its officers, employees, or representatives and the industry member, if:

(a) There is an agreement or understanding, implied or explicit, that the money or thing of value will be passed on to the officers, employees, or representatives, or

(b) It is obvious by the very nature of the item given (such as a free trip) that a pass through to the officers, employees, or representatives is clearly contemplated, or

(c) The records of the recipient wholesaler do not accurately reflect such money or item as an asset or the wholesale entity, thus being subject to all ensuing tax consequences as distinguished from the receipt of the money or item as a personal asset of an officer, employee, or representative.

###### § 10.24 Sales promotion contests.

Sales contests sponsored by an industry member which offer prizes directly or indirectly to trade buyer officers, employees or representatives are inducements within the meaning of the Act.

##### Subpart D - Exclusion

###### § 10.51 Exclusion, in general.

(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:

(1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) trade buyer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and trade buyer or by any other means of industry member control over the trade buyer, and

(2) Such practice results in the trade buyer purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product.

(b) Section 10.52 lists practices that create a tie or link that places trade buyer independence at risk. Section 10.53 is reserved and will list practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 10.54 lists the criteria used for determining whether other practices can put trade buyer independence at risk.

###### § 10.52 Practice which puts trade buyer independence at risk.

The practice specified in this section is deemed to place trade buyer independence at risk within the description of exclusion in § 10.51: Industry member payments of money to the employee(s) of a trade buyer without the knowledge or consent of the trade buyer-employer in return for the employee agreeing to order distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member. The practice enumerated here is an example and does not constitute a complete list of those situations which result in such control.

###### § 10.53 Practices not resulting in exclusion. [Reserved]

###### § 10.54 Criteria for determining trade buyer independence.

The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice between an industry member and an officer, employee, or representative of a trade buyer, other than those in § 10.52, places trade buyer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to place trade buyer independence at risk.

(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a trade buyer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to retailers and consumers.

(b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.

(c) The trade buyer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.

(d) The trade buyer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.

(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the trade buyer. For example, the industry member controls the trade buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the trade buyer's premises.

(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all trade buyers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

#### PART 11 - CONSIGNMENT SALES

##### Subpart A - Scope of Regulations

###### § 11.1 General.

The regulations in this part, issued pursuant to section 105 of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 205), specify arrangements which are consignment sales under section 105(d) of the Act and contain guidelines concerning return of distilled spirits, wine and malt beverages from a trade buyer. This part does not attempt to enumerate all of the practices prohibited by section 105(d) of the Act.

(2) If: (i) The sale, purchase, offer or contract is made in the course of interstate or foreign commerce; or

(ii) The industry member engages in using the practice to such an extent as substantially to restrain or prevent transactions in interstate or foreign commerce in any such products; or

(iii) The direct effect of the sale, purchase, offer or contract is to prevent, deter, hinder, or restrict other persons from selling or offering for sale any such products to such trade buyer in interstate or foreign commerce.

(b)In the case of malt beverages, this part applies to transactions between a retailer in any State and a brewer, importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages inside or outside such State only to the extent that the law of such State imposes requirements similar to the requirements of section 5(d) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 205(d)), with respect to similar transactions between a retailer in such State and a brewer, importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages in such State.

(b)Any appropriate TTB officer shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy any documentary evidence of any person, partnership, or corporation being investigated or proceeded against. An appropriate TTB officer shall also have the power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation, upon a satisfactory showing the requested evidence may reasonably be expected to yield information relevant to any matter being investigated under the Act.

(b)The exchange of one product for another is prohibited as a sales transaction conditioned on the acquisition of other products. However, the exchange of a product for equal quantities (case for case) of the same type and brand of product, in containers of another size is not considered an acquisition of “other” products and is not prohibited if there was no direct or implied privilege of return extended when the product was originally sold. Industry members may make price adjustments on products eligible for exchange under this paragraph.

###### § 11.24 Other than a bona fide sale.

TTB will not individually notify all holders of certificates of label approval, certificates of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approvals that their approvals have been revoked if the revocation occurs by operation of either TTB-administered law or regulation or applicable law or regulation of other agencies. If changes in labeling or other requirements are made as a result of amendments or revisions to the law or regulations, the certificate holder must voluntarily surrender all certificates that are no longer in compliance. The holder must submit applications for new certificates in compliance with the new requirements, unless TTB determines that new applications are not necessary.

###### § 13.54 Decision after appeal.

If the decision is that the law or regulation at issue requires the revocation of the certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval, a letter must be issued explaining the basis for the revocation, and citing the specific laws or regulations which required the revocation of the certificate. If the decision is that the law or regulation at issue does not require the revocation of such certificate, a letter explaining the decision must be sent to the certificate holder.

(d)One copy of each approved Form 5154.1 shall be returned to the manufacturer. The formulas returned to manufacturers shall be kept in serial order at the place of manufacture, as provided in § 17.170, and shall be made available to appropriate TTB officers for examination in the investigation of drawback claims.

###### § 17.122 Amended or revised formulas.

Except as provided in this section, amended or revised formulas are considered to be new formulas and shall be numbered accordingly. Minor changes may be made to a current formula on TTB Form 5154.1 with retention of the original formula number, if approval is obtained from the appropriate TTB officer. In order to obtain approval to make a minor formula change, the person holding the Form 5154.1 shall submit a letter of application to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating the formula change and requesting that the proposed change be considered a minor change. Each such application shall clearly identify the original formula by number, date of approval, and name of product. The application shall indicate whether the product is, has been, or will be used in alcoholic beverages, and shall specify whether the proposed change is intended as a substitution or merely as an alternative for the original formula. No changes may be made to current formulas without specific TTB approval in each case.

###### § 17.123 Statement of process.

Any person claiming drawback under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to file a statement of process, in addition to that required by TTB Form 5154.1, as well as any other data necessary for consideration of the claim for drawback. When pertinent to consideration of the claim, submission of copies of the commercial labels used on the finished products may also be required.

###### § 17.124 Samples.

Any person claiming drawback or submitting a formula for approval under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to submit a sample of each nonbeverage or intermediate product for analysis. If the product is manufactured with a mixture of oil or other ingredients, the composition of which is unknown to the claimant, a 1-ounce sample of the mixture shall be submitted with the sample of finished product when so required.

###### § 17.125 Adoption of formulas and processes.

(a)If there is a change in the proprietorship of a nonbeverage plant and the successor desires to use the predecessor's formulas at the same location, the successor may, in lieu of submitting new formulas in its own name, adopt any or all of the formulas of the predecessor by filing a notice of adoption with the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be filed with the first claim relating to any of the adopted formulas. The notice shall list, by name and serial number, all formulas to be adopted, and shall state that the products will be manufactured in accordance with the adopted formulas and processes. The notice shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the articles of incorporation or other document(s) necessary to prove the transfer of ownership. The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the notice with the related formulas.

(b)A manufacturer's own formulas may be adopted for use at another of the manufacturer's plants. Further, a wholly owned subsidiary may adopt the formulas of the parent company, and vice versa. A letterhead notice must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer and be accompanied by two photocopies of each formula to be adopted. The notice shall list the numbers of all formulas to be adopted and shall indicate the plant where each was originally approved and the plant(s) where each is to be adopted. Some evidence of the relationship between the plants involved in the adoption shall be attached to the notice. The notice shall be referenced in Part IV of the supporting data (TTB Form 5154.2) filed with the first claim relating to the adopted formula(s).

###### § 17.126 Formulas for intermediate products.

(a) The manufacturer shall submit a formula on TTB Form 5154.1 for each self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits and intended for the manufacturer's own use in nonbeverage products, unless the formula for any such ingredient is fully expressed as part of the approved formula for each nonbeverage product in which that ingredient is used, or unless the formula for the ingredient is contained in one of the pharmaceutical publications listed in § 17.132.

(b) Upon receipt of Form 5154.1 covering a self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, the formula shall be examined under § 17.131. If the formula is approved for drawback, the ingredient shall be treated as a finished nonbeverage product for purposes of this part, rather than as an intermediate product, notwithstanding its use by the manufacturer. (For example, see § 17.152(d).) If the formula is disapproved for drawback, the ingredient may be treated as an intermediate product in accordance with this part. Requirements pertaining to intermediate products are found in § 17.185(b).

(c) If there is a change in the composition of an intermediate product, the manufacturer shall submit an amended or revised formula, as provided in § 17.122.

###### § 17.127 Self-manufactured ingredients treated optionally as unfinished nonbeverage products.

A self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, which otherwise would be treated as an intermediate product, may instead be treated as an unfinished nonbeverage product, if the ingredient's formula is fully expressed as a part of the approved formula for the nonbeverage product in which the ingredient will be used. A manufacturer desiring to change the treatment of an ingredient from “intermediate product” to “unfinished nonbeverage product” (or vice versa) may do so by resubmitting the applicable formula(s) on TTB Form 5154.1. Requirements pertaining to unfinished nonbeverage products are found in § 17.185(c).

##### Subpart G - Claims for Drawback

###### § 17.141 Drawback.

Upon the filing of a claim as provided in this subpart, drawback shall be allowed to any person who meets the requirements of this part. Drawback shall be paid at the rate specified by 26 U.S.C. 5114 on each proof gallon of distilled spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined and which have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. The drawback rate is $1.00 less than the effective tax rate. Drawback shall be allowed only to the extent that the claimant can establish, by evidence satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer, the actual quantity of taxpaid or tax-determined distilled spirits used in the manufacture of the product, and the effective tax rate applicable to those spirits.

###### § 17.142 Claims.

(a)The manufacturer must file claim for drawback with the appropriate TTB officer who has the authority to approve or disapprove claims. A separate claim shall be filed for each place of business. Each claim shall pertain only to distilled spirits used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products during any one quarter of the tax year. Unless the manufacturer is eligible to file monthly claims (see §§ 17.143 and 17.144), only one claim per quarter may be filed for each place of business. Claims shall be filed on TTB Form 2635 (5620.8), Claim&#x2014;Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes.

(b)If a manufacturer of nonbeverage products is owned and operated by the same business entity that owns and operates a distilled spirits plant, the manufacturer's claim for drawback may be filed for credit on Form 2635 (5620.8). After the claim is approved, the distilled spirits plant may use the claim as an adjustment decreasing the taxes due in Schedule B of TTB Form 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. Adjustments resulting from an approved drawback claim are not subject to interest. This procedure may be utilized only if the manufacturer of nonbeverage products and the distilled spirits plant have the same employer identification number.

###### § 17.143 Notice for monthly claims.

If the manufacturer has notified the appropriate TTB officer, in writing, of an intention to file claims on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis, and has filed a bond in compliance with the provisions of this part, claims may be filed monthly instead of quarterly. The election to file monthly claims shall not preclude a manufacturer from filing a single claim covering an entire quarter, or a single claim covering just two months of a quarter, or two claims (one of them covering one month and the other covering two months). An election for the filing of monthly claims may be withdrawn by the manufacturer by filing a notice to that effect, in writing, with the appropriate TTB officer.

###### § 17.144 Bond for monthly claims.

Each person intending to file claims for drawback on a monthly basis shall file an executed bond on TTB Form 5154.3, conforming to the provisions of subpart E of this part. A monthly drawback claim shall not be allowed until bond coverage in a sufficient amount has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. When the limit of liability under a bond given in less than the maximum amount has been reached, further drawback on monthly claims may be suspended until a strengthening or superseding bond in a sufficient amount is furnished.

###### § 17.145 Date of filing claim.

Quarterly claims for drawback shall be filed within six months after the quarter in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Monthly claims for drawback may be filed at any time after the end of the month in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products, but shall be filed not later than the close of the sixth month succeeding the quarter in which the spirits were used.

###### § 17.146 Information to be shown by the claim.

The claim shall show the following:

(a) [Reserved]

(b) That the distilled spirits on which drawback is claimed were fully taxpaid or tax-determined at the effective tax rate applicable to the distilled spirits.

(c) That the distilled spirits on which the drawback is claimed were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products.

(d) Whether the nonbeverage products were manufactured in compliance with quantitative formulas approved under subpart F of this part. (If not, attach explanation.)

(e) That the data submitted in support of the claim are correct.

###### § 17.147 Supporting data.

(a) Each claim for drawback shall be accompanied by supporting data presented according to the format shown on TTB Form 5154.2, Supporting Data for Nonbeverage Drawback Claims (or according to any other suitable format which provides the same information). Modifications of Form 5154.2 may be used without prior authorization, if the modified format clearly shows all of the required information that is pertinent to the manufacturing operation. Under § 17.123, the appropriate TTB officer may require additional supporting data when needed to determine the correctness of drawback claims.

(b) Separate data shall be shown for eligible distilled spirits taxpaid at different effective tax rates. This requirement applies to all eligible spirits, including eligible recovered alcohol and eligible spirits contained in intermediate products.

(c) Separate data shall be shown for imported rum, spirits from Puerto Rico containing at least 92% rum, and spirits from the U.S. Virgin Islands containing at least 92% rum. The total number of proof gallons of each such category used subject to drawback during the claim period shall also be shown, with separate totals for each effective tax rate. These amounts shall include eligible spirits and rum from intermediate products or recovered alcohol.

(d) Any gain in eligible distilled spirits reported in the supporting data shall be reflected by an equivalent deduction from the amount of drawback claimed. Gains shall not be offset by known losses.

###### § 17.148 Allowance of claims.

(a)Except in the case of fraudulent noncompliance, no claim for drawback shall be denied for a failure to comply with either 26 U.S.C. 5111&#x2013;5114 or the requirements of this part, if the claimant establishes that spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined were in fact used in the manufacture of medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, which were unfit for beverage purposes.

(b)Noncompliance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5111&#x2013;5114 or of this part subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each separate product, reflected in a claim for drawback, to which the noncompliance relates, or the amount claimed for that product, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the noncompliance was due to reasonable cause. Late filing of a claim subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 or the amount of the claim, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the lateness was due to reasonable cause.

(c)Reasonable cause exists where a claimant establishes it exercised ordinary business care and prudence, and still was unable to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. Ignorance of law or regulations, in and of itself, is not reasonable cause. Each case is individually evaluated.

##### Subpart H - Records

###### § 17.161 General.

Each person claiming drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products shall maintain records showing the information required in this subpart. No particular form is prescribed for these records, but the data required to be shown shall be clearly recorded and organized to enable appropriate TTB officers to trace each operation or transaction, monitor compliance with law and regulations, and verify the accuracy of each claim. Ordinary business records, including invoices and cost accounting records, are acceptable if they show the required information or are annotated to show any such information that is lacking. The records shall be kept complete and current at all times and shall be retained by the manufacturer at the place where the taxpaid distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products, for the period prescribed in § 17.170.

###### § 17.162 Receipt of distilled spirits.

(a)For distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, barrels, or drums, the manufacturer shall record, with respect to each shipment received&#x2014;

(1) The date of receipt;

(2) The name and address of the person from whom received;

(3) The serial number or other identification mark (if any) of each tank car, tank truck, barrel, or drum;

(4) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined the tax;

(5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and

(6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.

(b)For distilled spirits received in bottles, the manufacturer shall record&#x2014;

(1) The date of receipt;

(2) The name and address of the seller;

(3) The serial number of each case, if the bottles are received in cases;

(4) The name of the bottler;

(5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and

(6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.

(c)For distilled spirits received by pipeline, the manufacturer shall record&#x2014;

(1) The date of receipt;

(2) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined the tax;

(3) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and

(4) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.

(d)At the time of receipt, each manufacturer shall determine (preferably by weight) and record the exact number of proof gallons of distilled spirits received. The amount received in bottles may be determined by the required statements on the labels. The amount received in sealed drums with no evidence of leakage may be determined from the record of shipment, which is required by § 19.626 of this chapter to accompany spirits received from a distilled spirits plant. If spirits are received in a tank car or tank truck, and the result of the manufacturer's gauge of the spirits is within 0.2 percent of the number of proof gallons reported on the record of shipment required by § 19.626, then the number of proof gallons reported on that record may be recorded as the quantity received. Nevertheless, the receiving gauge shall be noted on the record of receipt. If, for any shipment, the amount recorded in the manufacturer's records as the quantity received is greater than the amount shown as taxpaid on the record required by § 19.626, a deduction equivalent to the excess shall be made from the amount of drawback claimed in the manufacturer's claim covering that period. If no claim is filed for that period, then the deduction shall be made in the manufacturer's next claim. Losses in transit that exceed the 0.2 percent limitation provided in this paragraph shall be determined and noted on the record of receipt. Such losses shall not be recorded as distilled spirits received.

(e)If spirits are received which contain at least 92% rum, and which originate from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the record of receipt shall indicate the place of origin. If rum is received, the record shall indicate whether it is from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic.

(f)If spirits are received directly from the distilled spirits plant that paid or determined the tax, the manufacturer shall retain the record of shipment required by § 19.626 of this chapter. To the extent that the information on that record duplicates the requirements of this section, retention of that record shall satisfy those requirements. If there are differences between the information on the record of shipment and the information required to be recorded by this section, the requirements of this section may be met by appropriate annotations on the record of shipment.

###### § 17.163 Evidence of taxpayment of distilled spirits.

(a)For each shipment of taxpaid spirits from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, the manufacturer shall obtain the record of shipment prepared by the supplier under § 19.626 of this chapter. This record shall be retained with the commercial invoice (if the latter is a separate document) as evidence of taxpayment of the spirits. The record shall show the effective tax rate(s) (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001) applicable to the shipment.

(b)Manufacturers shall obtain commercial invoices or other documentation pertaining to purchases of distilled spirits from wholesale and retail liquor dealers (including such dealership operations when conducted in conjunction with a distilled spirits plant). For spirits other than alcohol, grain spirits, neutral spirits, distilled gin, or straight whisky (as defined in the standards of identity prescribed by § 5.22 of this chapter), the manufacturer of nonbeverage products shall obtain evidence, from the producer or bottler of the spirits, as to the effective tax rate paid thereon.

(c)For imported spirits that were taxpaid through Customs, evidence of such taxpayment (such as Customs Forms 7501 and 7505, receipted to indicate payment of tax, and the certificate of effective tax rate computation, if applicable) shall be secured from the importer and retained by the manufacturer.

(d)If the evidence of effective tax rate, required by this section for distilled spirits products that may contain wine or flavors, is not obtained, drawback shall only be allowed based on the lowest effective tax rate possible for the kind of distilled spirits product used.

###### § 17.164 Production record.

(a)Each manufacturer shall keep a production record for each batch of intermediate product and for each batch of nonbeverage product. The production record shall be an original record made at the time of production by a person (or persons) having actual knowledge thereof. If any product is produced by a continuous process rather than by batches, the production record shall pertain to the total quantity of that product produced during each claim period.

(b)The record shall show the name and formula number of the product, the actual quantities of all ingredients used in the manufacture of the batch (including the proof or alcohol percentage by volume of all spirits), the date when eligible spirits were considered used (see § 17.152), the effective tax rate applicable to those spirits (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001), and the quantity of product produced. The alcohol content of the product shall be shown if a test of alcohol content was made (see paragraph (e) of this section). Usage of eligible and ineligible spirits shall be shown separately. If spirits from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, containing at least 92% rum, were used, the record shall indicate their place of origin. If rum was used, the record shall indicate whether it was from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic. If spirits were recovered, the production record shall so indicate, and the record required by § 17.168 shall be kept. If drawback is claimed on spirits consumed as an essential part of the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, which were not contained in that product at its completion, then the production record shall show the quantity of spirits so consumed in the manufacture of each batch.

(c)The production record shall refer to ingredients by the same names as are used for them in the product's formula. This includes formulas submitted to TTB and formulas contained in the publications listed in § 17.132. Other names for the ingredients may be added in the production record, if necessary for the manufacturer's operations. Usage of ingredients (including spirits) may be shown in units of weight or volume.

(d)Each manufacturer shall accurately determine, by weight or volume, and record in the production records the quantity of all distilled spirits used. When the quantity used is determined by volume, adjustments shall be made if the temperature of the spirits is above or below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. A table for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Table 7 of the “Gauging Manual,” is available. See subpart E of part 30 of this chapter and § 30.67. Losses after receipt due to leakage, spillage, evaporation, or other causes not essential to the manufacturing process shall be accurately recorded in the manufacturer's permanent records at the time such losses are determined.

(e)At representative intervals, the manufacturer shall verify the alcohol content of nonbeverage products. The results of such tests shall be recorded.

###### § 17.165 Receipt of raw ingredients.

For raw ingredients destined to be used in nonbeverage or intermediate products, the manufacturer shall record, for each shipment received&#x2014;

(a) The date of receipt;

(b) The quantity received; and

(c) The identity of the supplier.

###### § 17.166 Disposition of nonbeverage products.

(a)For each shipment of nonbeverage products, the manufacturer shall record&#x2014;

(1) The formula number of the product;

(2) The date of shipment;

(3) The quantity shipped; and

(4) The identity of the consignee.

(b)For other dispositions of nonbeverage products, the manufacturer shall record&#x2014;

(1) The type of disposition;

(2) The date of disposition; and

(3) The quantity of each product so disposed of.

(c)The manufacturer need not keep the records required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any nonbeverage product which either contains less than 3 percent of distilled spirits by volume, or is sold by the producer directly to the consumer in retail quantities. However, when needed for protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the keeping of these records upon giving at least five days' notice to the manufacturer.

###### § 17.167 Inventories.

(a)The “on hand” figures reported in Part II of TTB Form 5154.2 shall be verified by physical inventories taken as of the end of each quarter in which nonbeverage products were manufactured for purposes of drawback. Spirits taxpaid at different effective tax rates shall be inventoried separately. The inventory record shall show the date inventory was taken, the person(s) by whom it was taken, subtotals for each product inventoried, and any gains or losses disclosed; and shall be retained with the manufacturer's records. The manufacturer shall explain in Part IV of the supporting data (Form 5154.2) any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and the amounts indicated by the manufacturer's records. Any gain in eligible spirits disclosed by inventory requires an equivalent deduction from the claim with which the inventory is reported. Gains shall not be offset by known losses. If no claim is filed for a quarter (nor for any monthly period therein), then no physical inventory is required for that quarter.

(b)When necessary for ensuring compliance with regulations and protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may require a manufacturer to take physical inventories of finished nonbeverage products, and/or raw ingredients intended for use in the manufacture of nonbeverage or intermediate products. The results of such inventories shall be recorded in the manufacturer's records. Any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and such amounts as indicated by the manufacturer's records shall also be recorded with an explanation of its cause.

###### § 17.168 Recovered spirits.

(a) Each manufacturer intending to recover distilled spirits under the provisions of this part shall first notify the appropriate TTB officer. Any apparatus used to separate alcohol is subject to the registration requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5179 and subpart C of part 29 of this chapter. Recovery operations may only be conducted on the premises where the recovered spirits were used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage or intermediate products.

(b) The manufacturer shall keep a record of the distilled spirits recovered and the subsequent use to which such spirits are put. The record shall show&#x2014;

(1) The date of recovery;

(2) The commodity or process from which the spirits were recovered;

(3) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of distilled spirits recovered;

(4) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of recovered distilled spirits reused;

(5) The commodity in which the recovered distilled spirits were reused; and

(6) The date of reuse.

(c) Whenever recovered spirits are destroyed (see § 17.183), the record shall further show&#x2014;

(1) The reason for the destruction;

(2) The date, time, location, and manner of destruction;

(3) The number of proof gallons destroyed; and

(4) The name of the individual who accomplished or supervised the destruction.

###### § 17.169 Transfer of intermediate products.

When intermediate products are transferred as permitted by § 17.185(b), supporting records of such transfers shall be kept at the shipping and receiving plants, showing the date and quantity of each product transferred.

###### § 17.170 Retention of records.

Each manufacturer shall retain for a period of not less than 3 years all records required by this part, a copy of all claims and supporting data filed in support thereof, all commercial invoices or other documents evidencing taxpayment or tax-determination of domestic spirits, all documents evidencing taxpayment of imported spirits, and all bills of lading received which pertain to shipments of spirits. In addition, a copy of each formula submitted on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be retained at each factory where the formula is used, for not less than 3 years from the date of filing of the last claim for drawback under the formula. A copy of an approval to use an alternate method or procedure shall be retained as long as the manufacturer employs the method or procedure, and for 3 years thereafter. Further, the appropriate TTB officer may require these records, forms, and documents to be retained for an additional period of not more than 3 years in any case where he or she deems such retention to be necessary or advisable for protection of the revenue.

###### § 17.171 Inspection of records.

All of the records, forms, and documents required to be retained by § 17.170 shall be kept at the premises where distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products and shall be readily available during the manufacturer's regular business hours for examination and copying by the appropriate TTB officers. At the same time, any other books, papers, records or memoranda in the possession of the manufacturer, which have a bearing upon the matters required to be alleged in a claim for drawback, shall be available for inspection by appropriate TTB officers.

##### Subpart I - Miscellaneous Provisions

###### § 17.181 Exportation of medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts.

Medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts, approved for drawback under the provisions of this part, may be exported subject to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d), which authorizes export drawback equal to the entire amount of internal revenue tax found to have been paid on the domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of such products. (Note: Export drawback is not allowed for imported alcohol under this provision of customs law.) Claims for such export drawback shall be filed in accordance with the applicable regulations of the U.S. Customs Service. Such claims may cover either the full rate of tax which has been paid on the alcohol, if no nonbeverage drawback has been claimed thereon, or else the remainder of the tax if nonbeverage drawback under 26 U.S.C. 5114 has been or will be claimed.

###### § 17.182 Drawback claims by druggists.

Drawback of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5114 is allowable on taxpaid distilled spirits used by druggists in compounding prescriptions. The prescriptions so compounded shall be shown in the supporting data by listing the first and last serial numbers thereof. The amount of taxpaid spirits used in each prescription need not be shown, but such prescriptions shall be made available for examination by appropriate TTB officers. If refills have been made of prescriptions received in a previous claim period, their serial numbers shall be recorded separately. Druggists claiming drawback as authorized by this section are subject to all the applicable requirements of this part, except those requiring the filing of quantitative formulas.

###### § 17.183 Disposition of recovered alcohol and material from which alcohol can be recovered.

(a)Manufacturers of nonbeverage products shall not sell or transfer recovered spirits to any other premises without TTB authorization under § 17.3. If recovered spirits are stored pending reuse, storage facilities shall be adequate to protect the revenue. If recovered spirits are destroyed, the record required by § 17.168(c) must be kept. Spirits recovered from intermediate products may be destroyed without notice to TTB. Spirits recovered from nonbeverage products may be destroyed pursuant to a notice filed with the appropriate TTB officer at least 12 days prior to the date of destruction. The notice shall state the reason for the destruction, the intended date of destruction, and the approximate quantity involved. The appropriate TTB officer may impose specific conditions, including requiring that the destruction be witnessed by an appropriate TTB. Unless the manufacturer is otherwise advised by the appropriate TTB officer before the date specified in the notice, the destruction may proceed as planned.

(b)By-product material from which alcohol can be recovered shall not be sold or transferred unless the alcohol has been removed or an approved substance has been added to prevent recovery of residual alcohol. Material from which alcohol can be recovered may also be destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by a suitable method. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, prior written approval shall be obtained from the appropriate TTB officer as to the adequacy, under this section, of any substance proposed to be added to prevent recovery of alcohol, or of any proposed method of destruction.

(c)Specific approval from the appropriate TTB officer is not required when spent vanilla beans containing residual alcohol are destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by burning, or when they are removed from those premises after treatment with sufficient kerosene, mineral spirits, rubber hydrocarbon solvent, or gasoline to prevent recovery of residual alcohol.

###### § 17.184 Distilled spirits container marks.

All marks required by part 19 of this chapter shall remain on containers of taxpaid distilled spirits until the contents are emptied. Whenever such a container is emptied, such marks shall be completely obliterated.

###### § 17.185 Requirements for intermediate products and unfinished nonbeverage products.

(a)Self-manufactured ingredients made with taxpaid spirits may be accounted for either as intermediate products or as unfinished nonbeverage products. The manufacturer may choose either method of accounting for such self-manufactured ingredients (see § 17.127). However, the method selected determines the requirements that will apply to those ingredients, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

(b)Intermediate products shall be used exclusively in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Intermediate products may be accumulated and stored indefinitely and may be used in any nonbeverage product whose formula calls for such use. Intermediate products shall be manufactured by the same entity that manufactures the finished nonbeverage products. Intermediate products shall not be sold or transferred between separate and distinct entities. However, they may be transferred to another branch or plant of the same manufacturer, for use there in the manufacture of approved nonbeverage products. (See § 17.169 for recordkeeping requirement.) For the purposes of this section, the phrase “separate and distinct entities” includes parent and subsidiary corporations, regardless of any corporate (or other) relationship, and even if the stock of both the manufacturing firm and the receiving firm is owned by the same persons.

(c)An unfinished nonbeverage product shall only be used in the particular nonbeverage product for which it was manufactured, and shall be entirely so used within the time limit stated in the approved TTB Form 5154.1. Spirits dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be regarded as having been dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Spirits contained in such unfinished products shall be accounted for in the supporting data under § 17.147 and inventoried under § 17.167 as “in process” in nonbeverage products. Production of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be recorded as an integral part of the production records for the related nonbeverage products. Unfinished nonbeverage products shall not be transferred to other premises.

###### § 17.186 Transfer of distilled spirits to other containers.

A manufacturer may transfer taxpaid distilled spirits from the original package to other containers at any time for the purpose of facilitating the manufacture of products unfit for beverage use.

(b)If TTB determines that supervision of plant operations is necessary, TTB will notify the proprietor of the extent to which TTB intends to supervise those operations. If TTB determines later that TTB supervision is no longer necessary, the appropriate TTB officer will notify the proprietor of that fact.

###### § 19.14 Delegation of the Administrator's authorities to the appropriate TTB officer.

Most of the regulatory authorities of the Administrator contained in this part are delegated to appropriate TTB officers. These TTB officers are specified in TTB Order 1135.19, Delegation of the Administrator's Authorities in 27 CFR Part 19, Distilled Spirits Plants.

The appropriate TTB officer will hold the container at a safe place until it is determined whether the detained property is subject to forfeiture.

(b)A detention under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed 72 hours without process of law or intervention of the appropriate TTB officer.

###### § 19.19 Discontinuance of storage facilities.

If TTB determines that a proprietor's bonded storage facility for spirits is unsafe or unfit for use, or causes excessive waste or loss of spirits, TTB can require that the proprietor discontinue using the facility. Further, TTB can require the transfer of the spirits stored in the facility to another storage facility. The transfer will take place at such time and under such supervision as TTB may require, and will be at the expense of the owner or warehouseman of the spirits. If the owner or warehouseman fails to transfer the spirits within the prescribed time or to pay the expense of the transfer, as ascertained and determined by the appropriate TTB officer, the spirits may be seized and sold. TTB will first apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of the taxes due on the spirits and then to the cost and expense of the sale and removal, and the remaining balance, if any, will be paid over to the owner or warehouseman.

###### § 19.20 Installation of meters, tanks, and other apparatus.

The appropriate TTB officer may require the proprietor to install meters, tanks, pipes, or any other apparatus at the proprietor's plant if that officer decides that the equipment is necessary for the protection of the revenue. If the proprietor refuses or fails to install any such apparatus when instructed to do so, the proprietor will not be permitted to conduct business as a distilled spirits plant.

##### Subpart C - Restrictions on Production, Location, and Use of Plants

###### § 19.51 Home production of distilled spirits prohibited.

A person may not produce distilled spirits at home for personal use.

##### Subpart H - Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping

###### § 19.201 Definitions.

For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

A person that sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.

A dealer that sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.

A dealer that sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

###### § 19.202 Dealer registration.

Every proprietor that sells or offers for sale any alcoholic product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer under part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's application for registration of a distilled spirits plant filed under subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the distilled spirits plant. Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of wine, beer, or other proprietors' spirits. A proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the distilled spirits plant must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

###### § 19.203 Amending the dealer registration.

Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain a current and accurate distilled spirits plant registration. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the proprietor's approved notice of registration, the proprietor must amend the registration within the time period specified in subpart E of this part. An amendment of the proprietor's distilled spirits plant registration will also serve as an amendment of the proprietor's dealer registration under this subpart. The proprietor's dealer registration will also terminate when distilled spirits plant operations under the notice of registration terminate.

###### § 19.204 Dealer records.

Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Distilled spirits transactions that appear in the records required by subpart V of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the distilled spirits plant records, such as retail sales of wine or beer in a restaurant at the distilled spirits plant, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or beer, the proprietor must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.

##### Subpart R - Losses and Shortages

###### § 19.461 Losses and shortages in general.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, TTB will not collect tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines that are lost, destroyed, or otherwise unaccounted for while in bond, and if the tax has already been paid, TTB will refund the tax.

(b)TTB will collect the tax in the case of:

(1) Theft, unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that the theft occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them;

(2) Voluntary destruction carried out other than as provided in subpart Q of this part;

(3) An unexplained shortage of bottled spirits.

(c)When it appears that a theft occurred, the burden of proof will be on the proprietor or other person liable for the tax to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not result from connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them.

(d)Claims for losses and shortages allowable under this section must be filed in accordance with the provisions of subpart J of this part.

(e)TTB will abate, remit, credit, or refund taxes on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines lost by theft only to the extent that the claimant is not indemnified against, or recompensed for, the taxes paid or owed.

###### § 19.462 Determination of losses in bond.

(a)A proprietor must determine at any of the following times whether a loss of spirits, denatured spirits, or wines has occurred:

(1) Each time a tank or bulk conveyance is emptied;

(2) Upon discovery of an accident or an unusual variation in a gauge; and

(3) When required to take a physical inventory.

(b)Whenever any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are lost or destroyed in bond, whether by theft, tampering, or unauthorized voluntary destruction, the proprietor may elect voluntarily to pay the tax on the quantity lost. If the proprietor does not elect to pay the tax, the proprietor must promptly report the loss or destruction to the appropriate TTB officer. TTB may require that the proprietor file any claim for relief from the tax in accordance with § 19.263.

(c)When a proprietor cannot locate or otherwise account for any packages of spirits, denatured spirits, or wine recorded as deposited on bonded premises, the proprietor must promptly report that fact to the appropriate TTB officer. In such case the proprietor must either pay the tax on the lost spirits, denatured spirits, or wines or file a claim for relief from the tax in accordance with § 19.263.

(d)A proprietor must promptly report excessive in-transit losses to the appropriate TTB officer. As a general rule, when spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are received in bond in bulk conveyances TTB will consider as excessive a loss that exceeds 1 percent of the quantity consigned. However, in the case of transcontinental transfers of wine in bond, TTB will consider as excessive only a loss in excess of 2 percent of the quantity of wine consigned.

(e)A proprietor must pay the tax on excessive storage account losses of spirits unless the proprietor files a claim for remission in accordance with § 19.263 and TTB allows the claim under § 19.268. TTB will consider a storage account loss as excessive when the quantity of spirits lost during a calendar quarter from all storage tanks and stored bulk conveyances exceeds 1.5 percent of the total quantity contained in the tanks and stored bulk conveyances during the calendar quarter.

###### § 19.463 Loss of spirits from packages.

(a)The appropriate TTB officer may require that a proprietor pay the tax on any loss caused by tampering or theft of spirits from packages in storage unless the proprietor establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the loss was not due to connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor. As a general rule, the tax will be assessed on the quantity of spirits that represents the difference between the quantity originally entered in the package and the quantity remaining after discovery of the tampering or theft. However, if the proprietor can show that the package had already sustained normal storage losses before the tampering or theft occurred, the proprietor may exclude the amount of the normal storage losses from the quantity to be taxpaid.

(b)If tampering or theft has occurred at a proprietor's plant and the proprietor has failed to use effective controls to prevent it, the appropriate TTB officer may use an alternative to the general method of tax assessment specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In this case, the appropriate TTB officer may assess on each package showing evidence of tampering or theft an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of spirits.

###### § 19.464 Losses after tax determination.

If a proprietor sustains a loss of spirits after tax determination but prior to completion of physical removal of the spirits from bonded premises, the proprietor may file a claim in accordance with subpart J of this part.

###### § 19.465 Shortages of bottled spirits.

(a)The determination of whether an unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits exists must be made by comparing the spirits recorded as being on hand to either the results of the physical inventory required by § 19.372 or the results of any other complete physical inventory taken by the proprietor. When the recorded quantity is greater than the quantity determined by physical inventory, the difference is an unexplained shortage. The proprietor must adjust its records to reflect the results of the physical inventory.

(b)A proprietor must pay the tax on any unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits:

(1) Immediately on a prepayment return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return; or

(2) On a deferred payment return on TTB F 5000.24 for the period during which the shortage was determined.

After fermentation natural wines may be blended with each other only if produced from the same kind of fruit.

(b)Upon completion of fermentation or removal from the fermenter, the volume of wine will be accurately determined, recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations, as wine produced. Any wine or juice remaining in fermentation tanks at the end of the reporting period will be recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17.

###### § 24.177 Chaptalization (Brix adjustment).

In producing natural grape wine from juice having a low sugar content, pure dry sugar or concentrated grape juice may be added before or during fermentation to develop alcohol. In producing natural fruit wine from juice having a low sugar content, sugar, or concentrated juice of the same kind of fruit may be added before or during fermentation to develop alcohol. The quantity of sugar or concentrated juice added may not raise the original density of the juice above 25 degrees Brix. If grape juice or grape wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, the quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice for chaptalization will be included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, pure dry sugar added under this section is not considered as ameliorating material. However, if fruit juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization and liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used to chaptalize the fruit juice, the volume of water contained in the liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup will be included as ameliorating material.

###### § 24.178 Amelioration.

(a)In producing natural wine from juice having a fixed acid level exceeding 5.0 grams per liter, the winemaker may adjust the fixed acid level by adding ameliorating material (water, sugar, or a combination of both) before, during and after fermentation. The fixed acid level of the juice is determined prior to fermentation and is calculated as tartaric acid for grapes, malic acid for apples, and citric acid for other fruit. Each 20 gallons of ameliorating material added to 1,000 gallons of juice or wine will reduce the fixed acid level of the juice or wine by 0.1 gram per liter (the fixed acid level of the juice or wine may not be less than 5.0 gram per liter after the addition of ameliorating material).

(b)(1) Amelioration is permitted only at the bonded wine premises where the natural wine is produced.

(2) The ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not reduce the fixed acid level of the ameliorated juice or wine to less than 5.0 grams per liter.

(3) For all wine, except for wine described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not exceed 35 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Where the starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 7.69 grams per liter, a maximum of 538.4 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or juice.

(4) For wine produced from any fruit (excluding grapes) or berry with a natural fixed acid of 20 parts per thousand or more (before any correction of such fruit or berry), the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not exceed 60 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). If the starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 12.5 grams per liter, a maximum of 1,500 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or juice.

###### § 24.179 Sweetening.

(a)In producing natural wine, sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice of the same kind of fruit may be added after fermentation to sweeten wine. When juice or concentrated fruit juice is added, the solids content of the finished wine may not exceed 21 percent by weight. When liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the resulting volume may not exceed the volume which would result from the maximum use of pure dry sugar only.

(b)Any natural grape wine of a winemaker's own production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation provided the finished wine does not exceed 17 percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is more than 14 percent by volume or 21 percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.

(c)Any natural fruit wine of a winemaker's own production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation provided the finished wine does not exceed 21 percent total solids by weight and the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.

(d)Specially sweetened natural wine is produced by adding to natural wine of the winemaker's own production sufficient pure dry sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice of the same kind of fruit, separately or in combination, so that the finished product has a total solids content between 17 percent and 35 percent by weight, and an alcohol content of not more than 14 percent by volume. Natural wine containing added wine spirits may be used in the production of specially sweetened natural wine; however, wine spirits may not be added to specially sweetened natural wine. Specially sweetened natural wines may be blended with each other, or with natural wine or heavy bodied blending wine (including juice or concentrated fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added), in the further production of specially sweetened natural wine only if the wines (or juice) so blended are made from the same kind of fruit.

###### § 24.180 Use of concentrated and unconcentrated fruit juice.

Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to its original density, or to 22 degrees Brix, or to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix, and unconcentrated fruit juice reduced with water to not less than 22 degrees Brix, is considered juice for the purpose of standard wine production. Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to any degree of Brix greater than 22 degrees Brix may be further reduced with water to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix. The proprietor, prior to using concentrated fruit juice in wine production, shall obtain a statement in which the producer certifies the kind of fruit from which it was produced and the total solids content of the juice before and after concentration. Concentrated or unconcentrated fruit juice may be used in juice or wine made from the same kind of fruit for the purposes of chaptalizing or sweetening, as provided in this part. Concentrated fruit juice, or juice which has been concentrated and reconstituted, may not be used in standard wine production if at any time it was concentrated to more than 80 degrees Brix.

###### § 24.181 Use of sugar.

Only sugar, as defined in § 24.10, may be used in the production of standard wine. The quantity of sugar used will be determined either by measuring the increase in volume or by considering that each 13.5 pounds of pure dry sugar results in a volumetric increase of one gallon.

###### § 24.182 Use of acid to correct natural deficiencies.

(a)Acids of the kinds occurring in grapes or other fruit (including berries) may be added within the limitations of § 24.246 to juice or wine in order to correct natural deficiencies; however, no acid may be added to juice or wine which is ameliorated to correct natural deficiencies except that in the production of grape wine, tartaric acid may be used to reduce the pH of the juice or wine. If tartaric acid is used to correct the pH of grape juice or wine, the fixed acid level of the juice shall be measured prior to the addition of any tartaric acid to determine the maximum quantity of ameliorating material allowed. In addition, when using tartaric acid to reduce the pH of ameliorated grape juice or wine, the pH cannot be reduced below 3.0.

(b)Tartaric acid or malic acid, or a combination of tartaric acid and malic acid, may be added prior to or during fermentation, to grapes or juice from grapes. In addition, after fermentation is completed, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid or tartaric acid, or a combination of two or more of these acids, may be added to correct natural deficiencies. However, the use of these acids, either prior to, during or after fermentation, may not increase the fixed acid level of the finished wine (calculated as tartaric acid) above 9.0 grams per liter. In cases where the wine contains 8.0 or more grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as tartaric acid).

(c)Only citric acid may be added to citrus fruit, juice or wine, only malic acid may be added to apples, apple juice or wine, and only citric acid or malic acid may be added to other fruit (including berries) or to juice or wine derived from other fruit (including berries) to correct natural deficiencies to 9.0 grams per liter of finished wine; however, if the wine contains 8.0 or more grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to correct natural deficiencies to the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as malic acid for apples and citric acid for other fruit (including berries).

(d)A winemaker desiring to use an acid other than the acids allowed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to correct natural deficiencies shall follow the procedure prescribed in § 24.250. A winemaker desiring to use acid to stabilize standard wine shall follow the requirements prescribed by § 24.244.

###### § 24.183 Use of distillates containing aldehydes.

Distillates containing aldehydes may be received on wine premises for use in the fermentation of wine and then returned to the distilled spirits plant from which distillates were withdrawn as distilling material. Distillates produced from one kind of fruit may not be used in the fermentation of wine made from a different kind of fruit. Distillates containing aldehydes which are received at bonded wine premises and not immediately used will be placed in a locked room or tank on bonded wine premises. Distillates containing aldehydes may not be mingled with wine spirits. If the distillates contain less than 0.1 percent of aldehydes, the proprietor shall comply with any additional condition relating to the receipt, storage, and use which the appropriate TTB officer may require to assure that the distillates are properly used and accounted for.

###### § 24.184 Use of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate.

(a)In the cellar treatment of natural wine of the winemaker's own production there may be added volatile fruit-flavor concentrate produced from the same kind of fruit or from the same variety of berry or grape so long as the proportion of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate added to the wine does not exceed the equivalent proportion of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate of the original juice or must from which the wine was produced.

(b)Juice, concentrated fruit juice, or must processed at a concentrate plant is considered to be pure juice, concentrated fruit juice, or must even though volatile fruit-flavor has been removed if, at a concentrate plant or at bonded wine premises, there is added to the juice, concentrated fruit juice, or must (or in the case of bonded wine premises, to wine of the winemaker's own production made therefrom), either the identical volatile fruit-flavor removed or an equivalent quantity of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate derived from the same kind of fruit or from the same variety of berry or grape.

(c)The proprietor, prior to the use of volatile fruit flavor concentrate in wine production, shall obtain a certificate from the producer stating the kind of fruit or the variety of berry or grape from which it was produced and the total solids content of the juice before and after concentration.

###### § 24.185 Use of wood to treat natural wine.

(a)Natural wine may be treated with any wood that is consistent with the food additive requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The wood may be in the form of barrels, staves, chips, particles, or storage tanks that were used for the addition of wine spirits if the tanks are used for the baking of wine. The wood may be toasted (that is, heated to low, medium, or high, temperature without undergoing combustion), or charred and the wood must not be otherwise treated. If wine is treated with charred wood, the wood may not remove color from the wine.

(b)A proprietor may make or purchase for blending purposes wine that has been heavily treated with wood; however, wood preparations made with an alcohol solution stronger than 24 percent alcohol by volume are essences and must be used in accordance with § 24.85. Wood essences and extracts must be consistent with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act for that purpose and may be used only in “other wine” in accordance with § 24.218. This paragraph (b) applies to liquid extracts and essences and to the extracts and essences in powder form or dissolved in water after the solvent has been evaporated.

(c)Wooden storage tanks used for the addition of spirits may be used for the baking of wine.

###### § 24.186 Accidental additions of water.

(a)When in the production, storage, treatment, or finishing of standard wine, water is accidentally added to a standard wine in an amount that does not exceed 1 percent of the total volume of the wine, such wine shall remain standard wine and the proprietor need not take any action to correct the wine.

(b)When in the production, storage, treatment, or finishing of standard wine water is accidentally added to a standard wine in an amount that exceeds 1 percent of the volume of the wine, such wine may be corrected by removal of the accidentally added water from the wine in accordance with § 24.252.

##### Subpart G - Production of Effervescent Wine

###### § 24.190 General.

(a) Effervescent wine may be made on bonded wine premises. Where the effervescence results from fermentation of the wine within a closed container, the wine is classified and taxed as sparkling wine or as hard cider, as applicable. In such wine, the use of carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, or a combination of both, is permitted to maintain counterpressure during transfer and bottling. Wine carbonated by injection of carbon dioxide is classified and taxed as artificially carbonated wine or as hard cider, as applicable. (For wine to be classified and taxed at the hard cider tax rate, it must meet the requirements set forth in § 24.331, including the limitation of not more than 0.64 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters.)

(b) Effervescent wine and any wine used as a base in the production of effervescent wine may not have an alcohol content in excess of 14 percent by volume. However, wine containing more than 14 percent alcohol by volume may be used in preparing a dosage for finishing effervescent wine.

###### § 24.191 Segregation of operations.

Where more than one process of producing effervescent wine is used, the appropriate TTB officer may require the portion of the premises used for the production and storage of wine made by each process (bottle fermenting, bulk fermenting, or injecting carbon dioxide) to be segregated as provided by § 24.27.

###### § 24.192 Process and materials.

In preparing still wine or still hard cider for the production of effervescent wine, sugar and acid of the kinds and within the limitations prescribed in § 24.182 may be added with yeast or yeast culture to acclimate the yeast and to facilitate the process of secondary fermentation or to correct the wine. Fruit syrup, sugar, wine, wine spirits, and acid may be used in preparing a finishing dosage for effervescent wine provided the dosage does not exceed 10 percent by volume of the finished product. Where the proprietor desires to use more than 10 percent by volume finishing dosage, the proprietor shall file for a formula approval under § 24.80. The fruit syrup, wine spirits and wine used will come from the same kind of fruit as the wine from which the effervescent wine is made. In the production of effervescent wine, taxpaid wine spirits or wine spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used. Tax-free wine spirits may only be used in the production of effervescent wine that is a natural wine. In the refermentation and finishing of a sparkling wine or sparkling hard cider, the acids and materials specifically authorized in § 24.246 may be used.

###### § 24.193 Conversion into still wine or still hard cider.

Effervescent wine may be dumped for use as still wine or still hard cider. The dumping process will allow the loss of carbon dioxide remaining in the wine.

##### Subpart H - Production of Special Natural Wine

###### § 24.195 General.

Special natural wine is a flavored wine made on bonded wine premises from a base of natural wine. The flavoring added may include natural herbs, spices, fruit juices, natural aromatics, natural essences or other natural flavoring, in quantities or proportions such that the resulting product derives character and flavor distinctive from the base wine and distinguishable from other natural wine. Fruit juices may not be used to give to one natural wine the flavor of another but may be used with herbs or spices to produce a wine having a distinctive flavor. Caramel and sugar may be used in a special natural wine. However, the minimum 60 degrees Brix limitations prescribed in the definition of “Liquid pure sugar” and “Invert sugar syrup” in § 24.10 do not apply to materials used in the manufacture of vermouth. Finished vermouth will contain a minimum of 80 percent by volume natural wine. Heavy bodied blending wine and juice or concentrated fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added may be used in the production of special natural wine pursuant to formula approval.

###### § 24.196 Formula required.

Before producing any special natural wine, the proprietor shall receive approval of the formula by which it is to be made as provided by § 24.80. Any change in a formula will be approved in advance as provided by § 24.81.

###### § 24.197 Production by fermentation.

In producing special natural wine by fermentation, flavoring materials may be added before or during fermentation. Special natural wine produced by fermentation may be ameliorated in the same manner and to the same extent as natural wine made from the same fruit. Spirits may not be added to special natural wine with the exception of spirits contained in the natural wine used as a base or in authorized essences made on bonded wine premises as provided in § 24.86 or in approved essences made elsewhere. Upon removal of the wine from fermenters, the volume of liquid will be determined accurately and recorded as wine produced. The quantity of liquid in fermenters at the close of each reporting period will be reported on the TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations.

###### § 24.198 Blending.

Special natural wine may be blended with other special natural wine of the same class and kind, and with heavy bodied blending wine, or natural wine of the same kind of fruit, in the further production of special natural wine. The blending of special natural wines produced under different formulas requires the filing and approval of a formula authorizing a blending; however, where two or more formulas have been approved for the production of special natural wine of the same type, e.g., producing a sweet vermouth by blending sweet vermouths produced under two or more approved formulas, the submission and approval of an additional formula is not required.

##### Subpart I - Production of Agricultural Wine

###### § 24.200 General.

Agricultural wine may be produced on bonded wine premises from suitable agricultural products other than the juice of fruit. Water or sugar, or both, may be used within the limitations of this subpart in the production of agricultural wine. Agricultural wine may not be flavored or colored; however, hops may be used in the production of honey wine. Spirits may not be used in the production of the wine and a wine made from one agricultural product may not be blended with a wine made from another agricultural product. Agricultural wine made with sugar in excess of the limitations of this subpart is other than standard wine and will be segregated and clearly identified. Since grain, cereal, malt, or molasses are not suitable materials for the production of agricultural wine, these materials may not be received on bonded wine premises. Beverage alcohol products made with these materials are not classed as wine and may not be produced or stored on bonded wine premises.

###### § 24.201 Formula required.

Before producing any agricultural wine, the proprietor shall obtain an approval of the formula and process by which it is to be made pursuant to the provisions of § 24.80. Any change in a formula will be approved in advance as provided by § 24.81.

###### § 24.202 Dried fruit.

In the production of wine from dried fruit, a quantity of water sufficient to restore the moisture content to that of the fresh fruit may be added. If it is desired not to restore the moisture content of the dried fruit to that of the fresh fruit, or if the moisture content is not known, sufficient water may be added to reduce the density to 22 degrees Brix. If the dried fruit liquid after restoration is found to be deficient in sugar, sufficient pure dry sugar may be added to increase the total solids content to 25 degrees Brix. After addition of water to the dried fruit, the resulting liquid may be ameliorated with either water or sugar, or both, in such total volume as may be necessary to reduce the natural fixed acid level of the mixture to a minimum of 5.0 grams per liter; however, in no event may the volume of the ameliorating material exceed 35 percent of the total volume of the ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Pure dry sugar may be used for sweetening. After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening, the finished product may not have a total solids content that exceeds 35 degrees Brix.

###### § 24.203 Honey wine.

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a winemaker, in the production of wine from honey, may add the following:

(1) Water to facilitate fermentation, provided the density of the honey and water mixture is not reduced below 13 degrees Brix;

(2) Hops in quantities not to exceed one pound for each 1,000 pounds of honey; and

(3) Pure, dry sugar or honey for sweetening. Sugar may be added only after fermentation is completed.

(b) After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening, the wine may not have an alcohol content of more than 14 percent by volume or a total solids content that exceeds 35 degrees Brix.

###### § 24.204 Other agricultural products.

In the production of wine from agricultural products, other than dried fruit and honey, water and sugar may be added to the extent necessary to facilitate fermentation;That the total weight of pure dry sugar used for fermentation is less than the weight of the primary winemaking material and the density of the mixture prior to fermentation is not less than 22 degrees Brix, if water, or liquid sugar, or invert sugar syrup is used. Additional pure dry sugar may be used for sweetening, provided the alcohol content of the finished wine after complete fermentation or after complete fermentation and sweetening, is not more than 14 percent by volume and the total solids content is not more than 35 degrees Brix.

##### Subpart J - Production of Other Than Standard Wine

###### § 24.210 Classes of wine other than standard wine.

The following classes of wine are not standard wine:

(a) High fermentation wine, produced as provided in § 24.212;

###### § 24.211 Formula required.

The proprietor who desires to produce wine other than standard wine shall first obtain approval of the formula by which it is to be made, except that no formula is required for distilling material or vinegar stock. The formula is filed as provided by § 24.80. Any change in the formula will be approved in advance as provided by § 24.81.

###### § 24.212 High fermentation wine.

High fermentation wine is wine made with the addition of sugar within the limitations prescribed for natural wine except that the alcohol content after complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening is more than 14 percent and wine spirits have not been added. Although high fermentation wine is not a standard wine, it is produced, stored, and handled on bonded wine premises subject to the same marking or labeling requirements.

###### § 24.213 Heavy bodied blending wine.

Heavy bodied blending wine is wine made for blending purposes from grapes or other fruit without added sugar, and with or without added wine spirits, and having a total solids content in excess of 21 percent. Heavy bodied blending wine may be used in blending with other wine made from the same kind of fruit or for removal upon payment of tax, not for sale or consumption as beverage wine. Upon removal, the shipping containers and shipping records will be marked “Heavy Bodied Blending Wine&#x2014;Not for Sale or Consumption as Beverage Wine.”

###### § 24.214 Spanish type blending sherry.

Blending wine made with partially caramelized grape concentrate may be produced, stored, and handled on, or transferred in bond between, bonded wine premises, or removed upon payment of tax, not for sale or consumption as beverage wine. Wine of a high solids content and dark in color, produced under this section, is designated “Spanish Type Blending Sherry.” Upon removal, the shipping containers will be marked with the applicable designation and the legend “Not for Sale or Consumption as Beverage Wine.” Spanish type blending sherry is not standard wine and may not be blended with standard wine except pursuant to an approved formula or in the further production of this type of wine.

###### § 24.215 Wine or wine products not for beverage use.

(a)Wine, or wine products made from wine, may be treated with methods or materials which render the wine or wine products unfit for beverage use. No wine or wine products so treated may contain more than 21 percent of alcohol by volume at the time of withdrawal free of tax from bonded wine premises; nor may any wine or wine product so withdrawn be used in the compounding of distilled spirits or wine for beverage use or in the manufacture of any product intended to be used in the compounding. Wine or wine products produced under this section will be clearly identified and segregated from beverage wine products while stored on bonded wine premises and may be transferred in bond between bonded wine premises. The shipping records for transfers in bond of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked “Not for Sale or Consumption as Beverage Wine.” Upon removal from bonded wine premises free of tax, containers of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked to clearly indicate such products are not for sale or consumption as beverage wine, e.g., salted wine, vinegar, nonbeverage cooking wine.

(b)Salted wine is a wine or wine product not for beverage use produced in accordance with the provisions of this section and having not less than 1.5 grams of salt per 100 milliliter of wine. (12.5 pounds of salt/100 gallons of wine.)

(3) Wine made with sugar other than pure dry sugar, liquid pure sugar, and invert sugar syrup.

(4) Wine made with materials not authorized for use in standard wine.

(b)Other wine may be made on bonded wine premises but will remain segregated from standard wine. Other wine will have a basic character derived from the primary winemaking material. If sugar is used to make other wine, the aggregate weight of the sugar used before and during fermentation will be less than the weight of the primary wine producing material. Wine spirits may be added to other wine. Upon removal, other wine will be marked or labeled with a designation which will adequately disclose the nature and composition of the wine.

##### Subpart K - Spirits

###### § 24.225 Production and use of spirits.

(a)The proprietor of a bonded wine premises may withdraw and receive wine spirits without payment of tax from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for use as provided in this section.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The only products considered to be wine spirits authorized for use in wine production under this section are brandy or wine spirits produced in a distilled spirits plant (with or without the use of water to facilitate the extraction and distillation) exclusively from:

(i) Fresh or dried fruit or their residues;

(ii) Natural wine or wine residues from fresh or dried fruit, including spirits byproducts of authorized wine treatments to reduce alcohol; or

(iii) Special natural wine. If wine spirits produced from special natural wine contain any flavor characteristics of the special natural wine, those wine spirits may be used only in the production of a special natural wine.

(2)The proof of wine spirits at distillation must not be reduced by the addition of water. In addition, a product is not considered to be wine spirits if it is distilled at less than 140 degrees of proof except in the following cases:

(i) Commercial brandy aged in wood for a period of not less than 2 years, and barreled at not less than 100 degrees of proof, shall be deemed wine spirits for purposes of this section; and

(ii) Spirits byproducts of alcohol reduction processing authorized under § 24.248 that are produced at a distilled spirits plant and distilled, if necessary, at not less than 90 degrees of proof shall be deemed wine spirits for purposes of this section.

(3)When, in the production of natural wine or special natural wine, sugar has been added after fermentation, the wine may not be refermented to develop alcohol from such added sugar and then used in the production of wine spirits.

(4)(i) Wine spirits produced in the United States may be added to natural wine on bonded wine premises if both the wine and the spirits are produced from the same kind of fruit.

(ii) In the case of natural still wine, wine spirits may be added in any State only to wine produced by fermentation on bonded wine premises located within the same State.

(iii) If wine has been ameliorated, wine spirits may be added (whether or not wine spirits were previously added) only if the wine contains not more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume derived from fermentation.

(c)Spirits other than wine spirits may be received, stored, and used on bonded premises only for the production of nonbeverage wine products.

###### § 24.226 Receipt or transfer of spirits.

When spirits are received at the bonded wine premises, the proprietor shall determine that the spirits are the same as described on the transfer record and follow the procedures prescribed by § 19.407 of this chapter. A copy of the transfer record, annotated to show any difference between the description of spirits and quantity received, will be maintained by the proprietor as a record of receipt. If spirits are to be transferred to a distilled spirits plant or to bonded wine premises, the proprietor shall use the transfer record and procedures prescribed by § 19.405 of this chapter.

###### § 24.227 Transfer of spirits by pipeline for immediate use.

Spirits transferred by pipeline for immediate use are gauged either by weight or by volume on the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant. Where the spirits are gauged on the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant, the pipelines will be directly connected with the spirits addition tanks. The valves in the pipeline will be closed and locked with a lock at all times except when necessary to be opened for the transfer of spirits. Where the proprietor has placed wine in a spirits addition tank and has determined the quantity of spirits to be added, the spirits may be transferred.

###### § 24.228 Transfer of spirits by pipeline to a spirits storage tank.

Where it is desired to transfer spirits by pipeline to bonded wine premises and store the spirits prior to use, there will be provided a suitable tank for storing the spirits. The spirits to be transferred, if not gauged on the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant, will be gauged by weight or volume on bonded wine premises.

###### § 24.229 Tank car and tank truck requirements.

Railroad tank cars and tank trucks used to transport spirits for use in wine production will be constructed, marked, filled, labeled, and inspected in the manner required by regulations in 27 CFR part 19.

###### § 24.230 Examination of tank car or tank truck.

Upon arrival of a tank car or tank truck at the bonded wine premises, the proprietor shall carefully examine the car or truck to see whether the seals are intact and whether there is any evidence of tampering or loss by leaking or otherwise. Any evidence of loss will be reported to the appropriate TTB officer. The contents of the tank car or tank truck will be gauged by weight or volume at the time of receipt by the proprietor. If the tank car or tank truck has been accurately calibrated and the calibration chart is available at the bonded wine premises, the spirits may be gauged by volume in the tank car or tank truck.

##### Subpart M - Losses of Wine

###### § 24.265 Losses by theft.

The proprietor shall be liable for and pay the tax on wine unlawfully removed while on bonded wine premises, or while in transit thereto or therefrom in bond, unless the proprietor or other person responsible for the tax, establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not occur as the result of connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor or other person responsible for the tax or the owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or their agents or employees.

###### § 24.266 Inventory losses.

(a)The proprietor shall take a physical inventory of all untaxpaid wine on-hand on bonded wine premises as of the close of business each tax year, or where a cycle different from the tax year has been established as provided in § 24.313, the inventory will be taken annually at the end of that cycle, or at any time required by an appropriate TTB officer. The physical inventory of bulk and bottled or packed wine will be recorded and reported as required by § 24.313.

(b)The physical inventory of bulk wine will determine losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering since the previous physical inventory required by this section. A claim for allowance of loss, under the provisions of § 24.65, is required for inventory losses in production or storage:

(1) Where there are circumstances indicating that all or a part of the wine reported lost was unlawfully removed, or

(2)(i)(A) Where the loss of wine on bonded wine premises during the annual period exceeds three percent of the aggregate volume of wine on-hand at the beginning of the annual period and the volume of wine received in bond during the annual period;

(B) The loss exceeds six percent of the still wine or still hard cider produced by fermentation;

(C) The loss exceeds six percent of the sparkling wine or sparkling hard cider produced by fermentation in bottles;

(D) The loss exceeds three percent of the special natural wine produced under § 24.195 or other wine produced under § 24.218;

(E) The loss exceeds three percent of the artificially carbonated wine or artificially carbonated hard cider produced; or

(F) The loss exceeds three percent of the bulk process sparkling wine or bulk process sparkling hard cider produced.

(ii) The percentage applicable to each tax class of wine will be calculated separately, unless the calculation is impracticable because of the mixture of different tax classes by addition of wine spirits or blending during the annual period, in which case the percentage will be calculated on the aggregate volume. Wine removed immediately after production for use as distilling material and on which the usual racking, clarifying, and filtering losses are not sustained, will not be included in the calculations.

(c)Wine filled into a bottle or other similar containers are not subject to losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering. In addition, wine that has been filled into a bottle or other similar containers can be accurately accounted for and any unexplained shortage is considered evidence of an unreported removal. Therefore, the proprietor shall pay the tax on any unexplained loss of untaxpaid bottled or packed wine disclosed by inventory or otherwise.

###### § 24.267 Losses in transit.

Where the loss in transit of bulk wine shipped in bond or the total daily bulk wine in bond shipments received in bond from the same winery exceeds one percent (two percent on transcontinental shipments) of the volume shipped, the proprietor of the receiving bonded wine premises shall immediately notify the appropriate TTB officer and file a claim under the provisions of § 24.65.

###### § 24.268 Losses by fire or other casualty.

##### Subpart P - Eligibility for the Hard Cider Tax Rate

###### § 24.331 Wine eligible for the hard cider tax rate.

A wine removed on or after January 1, 2017 is eligible for the hard cider tax rate listed in § 24.270 if:

(a) It contains no more than 0.64 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine;

(b) It is derived primarily from apples or pears, or from apple juice concentrate or pear juice concentrate and water, as described in § 24.332(a);

(c) It contains no fruit product or fruit flavoring other than apple or pear, as described in § 24.332(b) and (c); and

(d) It contains at least one-half of 1 percent and less than 8.5 percent alcohol by volume.

###### § 24.332 Hard cider materials.

This section pertains to wine that is eligible for the hard cider tax rate as set out in § 24.331.

(a)Wine will be considered to be derived primarily from apples or pears, or from apple juice concentrate or pear juice concentrate and water, if the apple juice, pear juice, or combination of apple and pear juice, or the equivalent amount of concentrate of apple and/or pear juice reconstituted to the original brix of the juice prior to concentration, or any combination thereof, represents more than 50 percent of the volume of the finished product.

(b)(1) Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit product other than apple or pear. A fruit product is any material derived or made from any fruit or part of a fruit, including but not limited to, concentrates, extracts, juices, powders, or wine spirits.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 24.332(b)(1), an authorized wine treating material set forth in § 24.246 that is derived from a fruit other than apple or pear may be used in the production of wine otherwise eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it is used for a purpose other than flavoring and it is either used in accordance with the wine treating materials provisions of § 24.246 (if used in a natural wine), or used in amounts insufficient to impart a fruit flavor other than apple or pear (if used in a special natural wine or other than standard wine). In determining whether the use of wine treating materials derived from a fruit other than apple or pear is for a purpose other than flavoring, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a material derived from a fruit other than apple or pear (other than the inclusion of a wine treating material in an ingredient labeling statement) in the labeling or advertising of a wine will be treated as evidence that the wine treating material was added for the purpose of flavoring the wine.

(c)Wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate if it contains any fruit flavoring other than apple or pear. For purposes of this section, a fruit flavoring other than apple or pear is any flavoring that imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear and includes a natural fruit flavor, an artificial fruit flavor, and a natural flavor that artificially imparts the flavor of a fruit that is not contained in that flavor. In determining whether the use of a flavoring imparts the flavor of a fruit other than apple or pear, TTB will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising of the product. Any written or pictorial reference to a fruit flavor other than apple or pear in the labeling or advertising of a wine that contains a flavoring will be treated as evidence that the wine contains a flavoring that imparts a fruit flavor other than apple or pear and thus the wine is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate. The use of spices, honey, hops, or pumpkins as a flavoring will not make a wine ineligible for the hard cider tax rate.

(d)The appropriate TTB officer may withdraw approval of an alternate method or procedure, approved under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, if the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the approval.

##### Subpart G - Qualification of a Brewery

##### Subpart H - Bonds and Consents of Surety

###### § 25.91 Requirement for bond.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, every person intending to commence the business of a brewer shall file a bond, Form 5130.22, as prescribed in this subpart, covering operations at the brewery, at the time of filing the original Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10. Every brewer intending to continue the business of a brewer shall, once every 4 years, or as provided in § 25.95, execute and file a new bond, or continuation certificate as provided in § 25.97.

A brewer is considered to be paying tax on a deferred basis for purposes of the preceding sentence even if the brewer does not pay tax during every return period as long as the brewer intends to pay tax in a future period. See §§ 25.62 and 25.79 for rules governing applying for this bond exemption. See § 25.95 for rules governing when an existing brewer who has not provided a bond under this paragraph must obtain bond coverage.

###### § 25.92 Consent of surety.

A brewer may change the terms of any bond filed under this part by filing a consent of surety. Consents of surety will be executed on Form 5000.18 by the brewer and the surety on the bond, with the same formality and proof of authorization as required for the execution of a bond.

###### § 25.93 Penal sum of bond.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a brewer must furnish a bond of a penal sum as prescribed in this section.

(1)In the case of a brewer who pays taxes using semimonthly return periods under § 25.164(c)(1), the penal sum of the brewers bond must be equal to 10 percent of the maximum amount of tax calculated at the rates prescribed by law which the brewer will become liable to pay during a calendar year during the period of the bond on beer:

(i) Removed for transfer to the brewery from other breweries owned by the same brewer;

(ii) Removed without payment of tax for export or for use as supplies on vessels and aircraft;

(iii) Removed without payment of tax for use in research, development, or testing; and

(iv) Removed for consumption or sale.

(2)In the case of a brewer who pays taxes using annual or quarterly return periods under § 25.164(c)(2) or (c)(3), the penal sum of the brewers bond is $1,000 and covers the beer described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)&#x2013;(iv) of this section.

(3)This section does not apply to a brewer who is exempt from bond requirements under § 25.91(e).

(b)A brewer who concentrates beer under subpart R of this part shall calculate the penal sum of the bond by computing 10 percent of the amount of tax at the rates prescribed by law, on the maximum quantity of beer used in the production of concentrate during a calendar year. The brewer shall add this amount to the penal sum calculated under paragraph (a) of this section to determine the total penal sum of the brewer's bond.

(c)The maximum penal sum of the bond (or total penal sum if original and strengthening bonds are filed) is not to exceed $150,000 when the tax on beer is to be prepaid, or $500,000 when the tax is to be deferred as provided in § 25.164. The minimum penal sum of a bond is $1,000.

###### § 25.94 Strengthening bonds.

(a)When the penal sum of the brewer's bond (calculated as provided in § 25.93) in effect is not sufficient, the principal may prepay the tax on beer as provided in subpart K of this part, or give a strengthening bond in sufficient penal sum if the surety is the same as on the bond in effect. If the surety is not the same, a new bond covering the entire liability is required.

(b)A strengthening bond may not in any way release a former bond or limit a bond to less than the full penal sum.

(c)Strengthening bonds will show the current date of execution and their effective date.

###### § 25.95 Superseding bonds and new bonds for existing brewers.

(a)The appropriate TTB officer may at any time, at his or her discretion, require a new bond that supersedes the existing bond. A superseding bond is required immediately in the case of insolvency of a surety. Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity must execute a superseding bond or obtain a consent of surety on all bonds in effect. When the interests of the Government so demand, or in any case when the security of the bond becomes impaired for any reason, the principal will be required to give a superseding bond. When a bond is found to be not acceptable by the appropriate TTB officer, the principal will be required immediately to obtain a satisfactory superseding bond or discontinue business.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if an existing brewer has not furnished a bond covering operations and withdrawals of beer because the brewer was exempt from bond requirements under § 25.91(e), the brewer must furnish a bond as provided in this subpart beginning in any portion of a calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the brewer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000. When furnishing the bond, the brewer must also file an amended Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10, as provided in § 25.79 to change the brewer's bond status.

(2)&#x2014;(i)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, an existing brewer who must furnish a bond as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be treated as having furnished the required bond if the brewer submits the bond on Form 5130.22 no later than 30 days following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the brewer during the relevant calendar year exceeds $50,000. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the brewer will be treated as having furnished the required bond for the purposes of this paragraph until TTB approves or disapproves the bond.

(ii)The grace period specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to beer removed for consumption or sale on deferred payment of tax. A brewer that must furnish a bond under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may not remove beer for consumption or sale on deferred payment of tax until TTB approves the bond.

###### § 25.96 Superseding bond.

When the principal submits a new bond to supersede a bond or bonds in effect, the appropriate TTB officer, after approving the superseding bond, will issue a notice of termination for the superseded bond under the provisions of this subpart. Superseding bonds will show the current date of execution and their effective date.

###### § 25.97 Continuation certificate.

If the contract of surety between the brewer and the surety on an expiring bond or continuation certificate is continued in force for a succeeding period of not less than 4 years from the expiration date of the bond or continuation certificate, the brewer may submit, in lieu of a new bond, a Brewer's Bond Continuation Certificate on Form 5130.23, executed under the penalties of perjury, by the brewer and the surety attesting to continuation of the bond. Each continuation certificate will constitute a bond and all provisions of law and regulations applicable to bonds on Form 5130.22 given under this part, including the disapproval of bonds, are applicable to continuation certificates.

###### § 25.98 Surety or security.

(a)Bonds required by this part will be given with corporate surety or collateral security.

(b)Surety bonds may be given only with surety companies holding certificates of authority from the Secretary as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds, subject to the limitations set forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular 570, Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.

(c)Department of the Treasury Circular 570 is published in theannually on the first business day in July, and supplemental changes are published periodically thereafter. The most recent circular and any supplemental changes to it may be viewed on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Web site at

(d)A bond may be executed by two or more corporate sureties. Each corporate surety may limit its liability in terms on the face of the bond in a specified amount. This amount may not exceed the limitations set forth for corporate security by the Secretary which are set forth in the current revision of Treasury Department Circular No. 570. The sum of the liabilities for the sureties will equal the required penal sum of the bond.

(e)Bonds or notes of the United States, or other obligations which are unconditionally guaranteed as to both interest and principal by the United States, may be pledged and deposited by principals as collateral security in lieu of corporate surety in accordance with 31 CFR part 225.

(f)As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under paragraph (b) of this section, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by submitting cash or its equivalent (including a money order, cashier's check, or personal check). Cash or its equivalent must be no less than the penal sums of the required bonds. Bonds described in this paragraph will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. Cash equivalents must be payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

###### § 25.99 Filing powers of attorney.

Each bond, continuation certificate, and each consent of surety will be accompanied by a power of attorney authorizing the agent or officer to execute the document. The power of attorney will be prepared on a form provided by the surety company and executed under the corporate seal of the company. If the power of attorney submitted is other than a manually signed original, it will be accompanied by a certificate of its validity.

##### Subpart I - Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping

###### § 25.111 Definitions.

For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.

A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.

A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.

###### § 25.112 Dealer registration.

Every brewer who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10, filed under subpart G of this part, and approval of that notice by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the brewer's registration as a dealer at the brewery. Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of wine, spirits, or other brewers' beer. As provided in § 31.52 of this chapter, the brewer is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a brewer who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the brewery must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.

###### § 25.113 Amending the dealer registration.

Every brewer registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain a current and accurate Brewer's Notice, TTB Form 5130.10. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the approved Brewer's Notice, the brewer must amend the notice within the time period specified in subpart G of this part. An amendment to the Brewer's Notice, Form 5130.10, will also serve as an amendment of the brewer's dealer registration under this subpart. The brewer's dealer registration will also terminate when brewery operations under the Brewer's Notice terminate.

###### § 25.114 Dealer records.

Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Beer transactions that appear in the records required by subpart U of this part will meet the brewer's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the brewery records, such as retail sales of wine or distilled spirits in a restaurant at the brewery, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or distilled spirits, the brewer must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.

##### Subpart J - Marks, Brands, and Labels

###### § 25.141 Barrels and kegs.

(a)The brewer's name or trade name and the place of production (city and, if necessary for identification, State) shall be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. If the place of production is clearly shown on the bung or on the tap cover, or on a label securely affixed to each barrel or keg, the place of production need not be permanently marked on each barrel or keg. No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.

(b)(1) If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined in § 25.181), the place of production:

(i) May be shown as the only location on the bung, or on the tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg;

(ii) May be included in a listing of the locations of breweries qualified under this part if the place of production is not given less emphasis than any of the other locations; or

(2) If the location of two or more breweries is shown on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), or if the brewer's principal place of business is shown in lieu of the actual place of production (paragraph (b)(1)(iii)), the brewer shall indicate the actual place of production by printing, coding or other markings on the keg, bung, tap cover, or on a separate label attached to the keg. The coding system employed will permit an appropriate TTB officer to determine the place of production (including street address if two or more breweries are located in the same city) of the beer. The brewer must notify the appropriate TTB officer prior to employing a coding system.

(c)Labels or tap covers used by brewers shall be covered by certificates of label approval, Form 5100.31, when required by part 7 of this chapter.

###### § 25.142 Bottles.

(a)Each bottle of beer shall show by label or otherwise the name or trade name of the brewer, the net contents of the bottle, the nature of the product such as beer, ale, porter, stout, etc., and the place of production (city and, when necessary for identification, State). No statement as to payment of internal revenue taxes may be shown.

(b)(1) If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, firm, or corporation (as defined in § 25.181), the place of production:

(i) May be shown as the only location on the label;

The amount deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the lesser of $10.50, or the rate imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1) (including adjustments to the effective tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5010), on each proof gallon of rum imported into the United States.

###### § 26.31 Formula.

(a) The amount of excise taxes collected on rum that is imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be deposited into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands at the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7652(f). The distribution of such amount between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be computed by using permanent base percentages, which represent the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and from the Virgin Islands during fiscal year 1983. The base percentages are 87.626889 percent for Puerto Rico and 12.373111 percent for the Virgin Islands. The formula shall be as follows:

(1) Take the total amount of excise taxes collected on all rum brought or imported into the United States from all areas (including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands) during the previous fiscal year (October 1&#x2013;September 30) and multiply that amount by 0.87626889 to determine the share of the entire U.S. rum market that will be allotted to Puerto Rico and by 0.12373111 to determine the share of the entire U.S. rum market that will be allotted to the Virgin Islands;

(2) Subtract from the share allotted to Puerto Rico under paragraph (a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum brought into the United States from Puerto Rico during the previous fiscal year, and subtract from the share allotted to the Virgin Islands under paragraph (a)(1) of this section the excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States from the Virgin Islands during the previous fiscal year, to determine each possession's loss or gain in excise taxes in relation to the previous fiscal year's U.S. rum market. Then divide each result by the total excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States during the previous fiscal year from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

(b) Notwithstanding the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) above, the Virgin Islands' share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not exceed 49 percent nor drop below 12.373111 percent. Puerto Rico's share of the excise taxes on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall not exceed 87.626889 percent nor drop below 51 percent.

(c) The percentage for the distribution of the excise taxes collected on rum imported into the United States from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, that will be paid over to the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, shall be effective on March 1 of each year, and shall remain in effect until March 1 of the following year.

(d) The method for transferring the excise tax collections on rum imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, into the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands shall be the same as the method used for transferring excise taxes into the Treasury of Puerto Rico on distilled spirits (with an alcohol content of at least 92 percent rum) brought into the United States from Puerto Rico.

(e) The formula prescribed in this section shall take effect on March 1, 1987. Prior to that date, Puerto Rico shall continue to receive 86.4 percent of the eligible excise taxes on rum imported from areas other than Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands shall continue to receive 13.6 percent of these eligible excise taxes until March 1, 1987.

The credit is allowable at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.

(c) Where credit against the tax is desired, the person liable for the tax shall establish an effective tax rate in accordance with § 26.262a. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each withdrawal or other disposition of the distilled spirits within the United States.

###### § 26.262a Computation of effective tax rate.

(a) The proprietor shall compute the effective tax rate for distilled spirits containing eligible wine or eligible flavors as the ratio of the numerator and denominator as follows:

(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b) (1), (2), or (3), as applicable; and

(iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled spirits exceed 2% of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(2) The denominator will be the sum of:

(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and

(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided by 100.

(b) In determining the effective tax rate, quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors will be expressed to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon. The effective tax rate may be rounded to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that, such rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the nearest whole cent, and the effective tax rates for all products will be consistently expressed to the same number of decimal places. In such case, if the number is less than five it will be dropped; if it is five or over, a unit will be added.

(c) The following is an example of the use of the formula.

Any representative of the foreign producer in these proceedings must be authorized by the foreign producer pursuant to a duly executed power of attorney or other document deemed acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer. If the foreign producer does not submit a response within 45 days, the appropriate TTB officer will issue an order of revocation as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d)Following receipt of a foreign producer's response to a contemplated revocation, the appropriate TTB officer will consider the arguments raised in the response and issue an order either dismissing the contemplated revocation or imposing a revocation as authorized under paragraph (a) of this section. Any order imposing revocation will set forth the facts and analysis supporting the revocation, taking into consideration any response provided by the foreign producer under paragraph (c) of this section. The order will be provided electronically to the foreign producer or the foreign producer's representative in the matter.

(e)&#x2014;(1)A foreign producer may appeal an order of revocation issued under paragraph (d) of this section by submitting a written appeal to the appropriate TTB officer within 45 days of receipt of such order. The appeal must explain why the foreign producer believes its revocation is in error, supported by facts and analysis. The appeal must be submitted electronically through the means specified in the order of revocation. The appropriate TTB officer will issue a final decision by notifying the foreign producer within 90 days of receipt of the appeal whether the appeal is granted or denied, and the reasons for the determination. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if the appropriate TTB officer requires additional time to consider the issues presented by an appeal and must notify the foreign producer of the extension within the initial 90-day period. If the appropriate TTB officer fails to issue a decision granting or denying the appeal within the applicable deadline, the appeal is denied and such denial will be considered a final decision.

(2)A final decision from the appropriate TTB officer following appeal is required prior to application to the Federal courts for review of any order of revocation.

(f)In any instance where an order imposing revocation of a foreign producer's eligibility for CBMA tax benefits is issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment of CBMA tax benefits from that foreign producer of the revocation. In the event that the revocation is appealed and the appeal is granted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will notify any importer having an assignment from that foreign producer of the dismissal of such revocation.

##### Subparts D-Y [Reserved]

#### PART 30 - GAUGING MANUAL

##### Subpart A - Scope of Regulations

###### § 30.1 Gauging of distilled spirits.

(a)This part relates to the gauging of distilled spirits. The term “gauging” means the determination of the proof and the quantity of distilled spirits. The procedures prescribed in or authorized under the provisions of this part, except as may be otherwise authorized in this chapter, shall be followed in making any determination of quantity or proof of distilled spirits required by or under the authority of regulations in this chapter. The tables referred to in subpart E of this part appear in the “Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight” as incorporated by reference in this part (see paragraph (c) of this section). These tables, together with their instructions, shall be used, wherever applicable, in making the necessary computations from gauge data.

(b)Table 1 provides a method of correcting hydrometer indications at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit to true proof. If distilled spirits contain dissolved solids, temperature correction of the hydrometer reading by the use of this table would result in apparent proof rather than true proof. Tables 2 and 3 show the gallonage of spirituous liquor according to weight and proof. Table 4 shows the gallons per pound at each one-tenth proof from 1 to 200 proof. Table 5 shows the weight per wine gallon and proof gallon at each proof. Table 6 shows the volumes of alcohol and water and the specific gravity (air and vacuum) of spirituous liquor at each proof. Table 7 provides a means of ascertaining the volume (at 60 degree Fahrenheit) of spirits at various temperatures ranging from 18 degrees through 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

(c)The “Gauging Manual Embracing Instructions and Tables for Determining Quantity of Distilled Spirits by Proof and Weight” (Publication 5110.6; November 1978) is incorporated by reference in this part.

##### Subpart C - Gauging Instruments

###### § 30.21 Requirements.

(a)The proof of distilled spirits shall be determined by the use of gauging instruments as prescribed in this part.

(b)Proprietors shall use only accurate hydrometers and thermometers that show subdivisions or graduations of proof and temperature which are at least as delimitated as the instruments described in § 30.22.

(c)Appropriate TTB officers shall use only hydrometers and thermometers furnished by the Government. However, where this part requires the use of a specific gravity hydrometer, TTB officers shall use precision grade specific gravity hydrometers conforming to the provisions of § 30.24, furnished by the proprietor. However, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of other instruments approved by the appropriate TTB officer as being equally satisfactory for determination of specific gravity and for gauging. From time to time appropriate TTB officers shall verify the accuracy of hydrometers and thermometers used by proprietors.

###### § 30.22 Hydrometers and thermometers.

The hydrometers used are graduated to read the proof of aqueous alcoholic solutions at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; thus, they read, 0 for water, 100 for proof spirits, and 200 for absolute alcohol. Because of temperature-density relationships and the selection of 60 degrees Fahrenheit for reporting proof, the hydrometer readings will be less than the true percent of proof at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and greater than the true percent of proof at temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Hence, corrections are necessary for hydrometer readings at temperatures other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Precision hydrometers shall be used for gauging spirits. Hydrometers and thermometers shall be used and the true percent of proof shall be determined in accordance with § 30.31. Hydrometers are designated by letter according to range of proof and are provided in ranges and subdivisions of stems as follows:

Thermometers are designated by type according to range of degrees Fahrenheit and are provided in ranges and subdivisions of degrees as follows:

###### § 30.23 Use of precision hydrometers and thermometers.

Care should be exercised to obtain accurate hydrometer and thermometer readings. In order to accomplish this result, the following precautions should be observed. Bulk spirits should be thoroughly agitated so that the test samples will be representative of the entire quantity. The hydrometers should be kept clean and free of any oily substance. Immediately before readings are taken, the glass cylinder containing the thermometer should be rinsed several times with the spirits which are to be gauged so as to bring both the cylinder and the thermometer to the temperature of the spirits (if time permits, it is desirable to bring both the spirits and the instruments to room temperature). If the outer surface of the cylinder becomes wet, it should be wiped dry to avoid the cooling effect of rapid evaporation. During the readings the cylinder should be protected from drafts or other conditions which might affect its temperature or that of the spirits which it contains. The hands should not be placed on the cylinder in such a manner as to warm the liquid contained therein. The hydrometer should be inserted in the liquid and the hydrometer bulb raised and lowered from top to bottom 5 or 6 times to obtain an even temperature distribution over its surface, and, while the hydrometer bulb remains in the liquid, the stem should be dried and the hydrometer allowed to come to rest without wetting more than a few tenths degrees of the exposed stem. Special care should be taken to ascertain the exact point at which the level of the surface liquid intersects the scale of proof in the stem of the hydrometer. The hydrometer and thermometer should be immediately read, as nearly simultaneously as possible. In reading the hydrometer, a sighting should be made slightly below the plane of the surface of the liquid and the line of sight should then be raised slowly, being kept perpendicular to the hydrometer stem, until the appearance of the surface changes from an ellipse to a straight line. The point where this line intersects the hydrometer scale is the correct reading of the hydrometer. When the correct readings of the hydrometer and the thermometer have been determined, the true percent of proof shall be ascertained from Table 1. Another sample of the spirits should then be taken and be tested in the same manner so as to verify the proof originally ascertained. Hydrometer readings should be made to the nearest 0.05 degree and thermometer readings should be made to the nearest 0.1 degree, and instrument correction factors, if any, should be applied. It is necessary to interpolate in Table 1 for fractional hydrometer and thermometer readings.

###### § 30.24 Specific gravity hydrometers.

(a) The specific gravity hydrometers furnished by proprietors to appropriate TTB officers shall conform to the standard specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for such instruments. Such specific gravity hydrometers shall be of a precision grade, standardization temperature 60 &#xB0;/60 &#xB0;F., and provided in the following ranges and subdivisions:

(b) A certificate of accuracy prepared by the instrument manufacturer for the instrument shall be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer.

(c)The “Standard Specification for ASTM Hydrometers,” (E 100&#x2013;72 (1978)), published in the “1980 Annual Book of ASTM Standards” (STP 25 1062 (1980)), is incorporated by reference in this part. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register on March 23, 1981. This publication may be inspected at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and is available from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202&#x2013;741&#x2013;6030, or go to:

###### § 30.25 Use of precision specific gravity hydrometers.

The provisions of § 30.23 respecting the care, handling, and use of precision instruments shall be followed with respect to the care, handling, and use of precision grade specific gravity hydrometers. Specific gravity hydrometers shall be read to the nearest subdivision. Because of temperature density relationships and the selection of the standardization temperature of 60 &#xB0;/60 &#xB0;F., the specific gravity readings will be greater at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit and less at temperatures above 60 degress Fahrenheit. Hence, correction of the specific gravity readings will be made for temperature other than 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Such correction may be ascertained by dividing the specific gravity hydrometer reading by the applicable correction factor in Table 7.

##### Subpart D - Gauging Procedures

###### § 30.31 Determination of proof.

(a)The proof of spirits shall be determined to the nearest tenth degree which shall be the proof used in determining the proof gallons.

(b)Except as otherwise authorized by the appropriate TTB officer, the proof of spirits containing not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters of spirits shall be determined by the use of a hydrometer and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23 except that if such spirits contain solids in excess of 400 milligrams but not in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, there shall be added to the proof so determined the obscuration determined as prescribed in § 30.32.

(c)If such spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters at gauge proof, the proof shall be determined on the basis of true proof determined as follows:

(1) By the use of a hydrometer and a thermometer after the spirits have been distilled in a small laboratory still and restored to the original volume and temperature by the addition of pure water to the distillate; or

(2) By a recognized laboratory method which is equal or superior in accuracy to the distillation method.

(d)Except when the proof of spirits is used in making the guage prescribed in § 19.353 of this chapter or in making a gauge for determination of tax, the initial determination of proof made on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for such spirits may be used whenever a subsequent gauge is required to be made at that same plant provided that no material has been added to change the proof of the spirits.

###### § 30.32 Determination of proof obscuration.

(a)Proof obscuration of spirits containing more than 400 but not more than 600 milligrams of solids per 100 milliliters shall be determined by one of the following methods. The evaporation method may be used only for spirits in the range of 80&#x2013;100 degrees at gauge proof.

(b)Evaporate the water and alcohol from a carefully measured 25 milliliter sample of spirits, dry the residue at 100 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes and then weigh the residue precisely. Multiply the weight of the residue by 4 to determine the weight of solids in 100 milliliters. The resulting weight per 100 milliliters multiplied by 4 will give the obscuration. Experience has shown that 0.1 gram (100 milligrams) of solids per 100 milliliters of spirits in the range of 80&#x2013;100 degrees proof will obscure the true proof by 0.4 of one degree of proof. For example, if the weight of solids remaining after evaporation of 25 milliliters 0.125 gram, the amount of solids present in 100 milliliters of the spirits is 0.50 gram (4 times 0.125). The obscuration is 4 times 0.50, which is two degrees of proof. This value added to the temperature corrected hydrometer reading will give the true proof.

(c)Determine the apparent proof and temperature of the sample of spirits and then distill a carefully measured sample in a small laboratory still, and collect a quantity of the distillate, 1 or 2 milliliters less than the original sample. The distillate is adjusted to the original temperature and restored to the original volume by addition of distilled water. The proof of the restored distillate is then determined by use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference between the proof so determined and the apparent proof of the undistilled sample is the obscuration; or

(d)Determine the specific gravity of the undistilled sample, distill and restore the samples as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and determine the specific gravity of the restored distillate by means of a pycnometer. The specific gravities so obtained will be converted to degrees of proof by interpolation of Table 6 to the nearest 0.1 degree of proof. The difference in proof so obtained is the obscuration.

##### Subpart E - Prescribed Tables

###### § 30.61 Table 1, showing the true percent of proof spirit for any indication of the hydrometer at temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

This table shows the true percent of proof of distilled spirits for indications of the hydrometer likely to occur in practice at temperatures between zero and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and shall be used in determining the proof of spirits. The left-hand column contains the reading of the hydrometer and on the same horizontal line, in the body of the table, in the “Temperature” column corresponding to the reading of the thermometer is the corrected reading or “true percent of proof.” The table is computed for tenths of a percent.

###### § 30.62 Table 2, showing wine gallons and proof gallons by weight.

The wine and proof gallon content by weight and proof of packages of distilled spirits usually found in actual practice will be ascertained from this table. The left-hand column contains the weights. The true percent of proof is shown on the heading of each page in a range from 90 degrees to 200 degrees. Under the true percent of proof and on the same horizontal line with the weight will be found the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and the proof gallons respectively. Where either the weight or the proof of a quantity of spirits is beyond the limitations of this table, the number of proof gallons may be ascertained by reference to Table 3. This table may also be used to ascertain the wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallons of spirituous liquor containing dissolved solids where the weight, apparent proof (hydrometer indication corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit), and obscuration factor have been determined.

###### § 30.63 Table 3, for determining the number of proof gallons from the weight and proof of spirituous liquor.

When the weight or proof of a quantity of distilled spirits is not found in Table 2, the proof gallons may be ascertained from Table 3. The wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) may be ascertained by dividing the proof gallons by the proof.

###### § 30.64 Table 4, showing the fractional part of a gallon per pound at each percent and each tenth percent of proof of spirituous liquor.

This table provides a method for use in ascertaining the wine gallon (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and/or proof gallon contents of containers of spirits by multiplying the net weight of the spirits by the fractional part of a gallon per pound shown in the table for spirits of the same proof. Fractional gallons beyond the first decimal will be dropped if less than 0.05 or will be added as 0.1 if 0.05 or more.

###### § 30.65 Table 5, showing the weight per wine gallon (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) and proof gallon at each percent of proof of spirituous liquor.

This table may be used to ascertain the weight of any given number of wine gallons (at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or proof gallons of spirits by multiplying the pounds per gallon by the given number of gallons of the spirits. The table should be especially useful where it is desired to weigh a precise quantity of spirits.

###### § 30.66 Table 6, showing respective volumes of alcohol and water and the specific gravity in both air and vacuum of spirituous liquor.

This table provides an alternate method for use in ascertaining the quantity of water needed to reduce the strength of distilled spirits by a definite amount. To do this, divide the alcohol in the given strength by the alcohol in the required strength, multiply the quotient by the water in the required strength, and subtract the water in the given strength from the product. The remainder is the number of gallons of water to be added to 100 gallons of spirits of the given strength to produce a spirit of a required strength.

###### § 30.67 Table 7, for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

This table is prescribed for use in correcting spirits to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, multiply the wine gallons of spirits which it is desired to correct to volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the spirits. The product will be the corrected gallonage at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This table is also prescribed for use in ascertaining the true capacity of containers where the wine gallon contents at 60 degrees Fahrenheit have been determined by weight in accordance with Tables 2, 3, 4, or 5. This is accomplished by dividing the wine gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit by the factor shown in the table at the percent of proof and temperature of the spirits. The quotient will be the true capacity of the container.

The proof of spirits containing solids of 400 milligrams or less per 100 milliliters shall be determined by the use of a hydrometer and a thermometer in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23. However, notwithstanding the provisions of § 30.31, the proprietor may, at his option, add to the proof so determined the obscuration determined as prescribed in § 30.32.

##### Subpart C - Taxes

###### § 40.21 Cigar tax rates.

(a) Cigars are taxed at the following rates under 26 U.S.C. 5701(a):

(b) See § 40.22 of this part for rules concerning determination of sale price of large cigars.

(c) Cigars not exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. chapter 52 and the provisions of this part which are removed but not intended for sale shall be taxed at the same rate as similar cigars removed for sale.

###### § 40.22 Determination of sale price of large cigars.

(a)The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based on the sale price (the price for which the large cigars are sold by the manufacturer). In addition to money, goods or services exchanged for cigars may be considered as part of the sale price.

(b)&#x2014;(1)If there is any question concerning the applicable sale price for tax purposes, the appropriate TTB officer will determine such price, applying rules similar to the constructive sale price rules in 26 U.S.C. 4216(b) and the implementing regulations in 26 CFR 48.4216(b)&#x2013;1 through 48.4216(b)&#x2013;4. These constructive sale price rules apply to cigars sold by a manufacturer at retail, sold on consignment, or sold (otherwise than through an arm's length transaction) at less than the fair market price. Sales of cigars between affiliated corporations may be analyzed under the constructive sale price rules. The appropriate TTB officer may make this analysis on his or her own initiative or upon the written request of a manufacturer. If TTB decides it is necessary, we will publish constructive sale price determinations in the TTB Bulletin in accordance with § 70.701(d) of this chapter.

(2)&#x2014;(i)Adjustments to the sale price may occur as a result of a discount or price increase by the manufacturer or as a result of a TTB determination pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) above. In either case, the manufacturer must make conforming changes to the tax that was computed on the sale price before the adjustment.

(ii)If an adjustment is made before the end of the same tax return period as the original determination of the tax, the adjustment may be made on the same return. If the price is increased or decreased retroactively (during a later return period), either by the manufacturer or by TTB's determination, the manufacturer must make an adjustment on the tax return for the current return period in which the price change was determined.

(iii)The taxpayer must compute the adjustment to the tax as the difference between the tax that was paid and the tax that should have been paid, based on the newly determined sale price, together with interest thereon and any applicable penalties. The interest must be computed from the time of payment of the original tax until the time the adjustment was made. Upon request, the appropriate TTB officer will provide information regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods and any applicable penalties.

(3)If different bona fide sale prices are applicable to different types of packaging (boxes of 25 and boxes of 50), then the cigars in each type of packaging are taxed on the basis of their respective sale prices.

(4)If some of an otherwise identical cigar brand and size:

(i) Are distinctive from other such cigars because of physical imperfections, (ii) Are offered to the consumer through clear labeling as “imperfects”, “seconds”, “throw-outs”, or a comparable commonly understood term, and

(iii) The manufacturer has a separate sale price for such cigars, then they are taxed on the basis of this separate sale price.

(5)If a manufacturer has a sale price for a combination package containing cigars of different sizes, the cigars are taxed based on that combination sale price. If there is no sale price for the combination, then the cigars are taxed based on their individual sale prices.

(6)If a manufacturer makes taxable removals of a brand and size of cigar only for distribution by others who establish the sale price, the tax is based on such sale price even though the manufacturer who makes the removals does not establish the price.

###### § 40.23 Cigarette tax rates.

Cigarettes are taxed at the following rates under 26 U.S.C. 5701(b):

###### § 40.24 Classification of cigarettes.

For tax purposes, small cigarettes are designated Class A and large cigarettes are designated Class B.

###### § 40.25 Smokeless tobacco tax rates.

Smokeless tobacco products are taxed at the following rates under 26 U.S.C. 5701(e):

###### § 40.25a Pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco tax rates and classification.

(a)Pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco are taxed at the following rates under 26 U.S.C. 5701(f) and (g), respectively:

(b)(1) Pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco, before removal subject to tax, must be put up in packages that conform to the requirements of §§ 40.211 and 40.212, and of § 40.216a or § 40.216b as appropriate.

(2) Any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, that does not bear the notice for smokeless tobacco prescribed in § 40.216 or the notice for pipe tobacco prescribed in § 40.216a is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco. A container of processed tobacco, the contents of which weigh 10 pounds or less (including any added non-tobacco ingredients or constituents), that is removed within the meaning of this part for any purpose other than destruction, export, delivery as a sample to a manufacturer of processed tobacco or tobacco products for the purpose of soliciting orders of processed tobacco, or scientific testing or testing of equipment which results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco to the factory premises, is deemed to be a package offered for sale or delivery to the ultimate consumer.

(3) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco, even though the package bears the notice required for pipe tobacco under § 40.216a, if:

(i) The package does not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in direct conjunction with, parallel to, and in substantially the same conspicuousness of type and background as the brand name each time the brand name appears on the package; or

(ii) The package or accompanying materials bear any representation that would suggest a use other than as pipe tobacco. (26 U.S.C. 5702 and 5723) The term 'accompanying materials' includes, but is not limited to, any point of sale advertising or other printed product communications issued by the manufacturer or importer of pipe tobacco products. In addition, the inclusion of cigarette papers or tubes in a package bearing a 'pipe tobacco' declaration will suggest a use other than pipe tobacco.

(4) During the period from June 22, 2009, through March 23, 2010, manufacturers may continue to remove products as pipe tobacco in packages that do not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

###### § 40.26 Persons liable for tax.

The manufacturer of tobacco products shall be liable for the taxes imposed on tobacco products by 26 U.S.C. 5701:That when tobacco products are transferred in bond pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5704, to the bonded premises of another such manufacturer or an export warehouse proprietor, the transferee shall become liable for the tax upon receipt by him of such products and the transferor shall thereupon be relieved of his liability for the tax. When tobacco products are released in bond from customs custody for transfer to the bonded premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products, the transferee shall become liable for the tax on such products upon release from customs custody. Any person who possesses tobacco products in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5751(a)(1) or (2), shall be liable for a tax equal to the tax on such products.

###### § 40.27 Assessment.

Whenever any person required by law to pay tax on tobacco products fails to pay such tax, the tax shall be ascertained and assessed against such person, subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after notice has been afforded such person to show cause against assessment. The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.

##### Subpart Ca - Special (Occupational) Taxes

###### § 40.31 Liability for special tax.

(a)Every manufacturer of tobacco products shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by § 40.32 of the part. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the business of manufacturing tobacco products, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).

(b) [Reserved]

(c)A manufacturer of tobacco products incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.

(d)Special tax must be paid by return. The prescribed return is TTB Form 5630.5t, Special Tax Registration and Return&#x2014;Tobacco. Special tax returns, with payment of tax, must be filed with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the form and the requirements of subpart D of part 46 of this chapter.

###### § 40.32 Rates of special tax.

(a)Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(1) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every manufacturer of tobacco products.

(b)Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of tobacco products whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 40.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.

(c)All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563&#x2013;1 through 1.1563&#x2013;4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.

(d)Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(e)Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

###### § 40.33 Cross reference.

For additional rules pertaining to liability for special tax, filing special tax returns, issuance and examination of special (occupational) tax stamps, and notification of changes to special tax stamps, see subpart D of part 46 of this chapter.

###### §§ 40.34-40.36 [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Administrative Provisions

###### § 40.41 Forms prescribed.

(a) The appropriate TTB officer is authorized to prescribe all forms required by this part. All of the information called for in each form shall be furnished as indicated by the headings on the form and the instructions on or pertaining to the form. In addition, information called for in each form shall be furnished as required by this part.

Any appropriate TTB officer may enter in the daytime any premises where tobacco products are produced or kept, so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of examining such products. When such premises are open at night, any appropriate TTB officer may enter them, while so open, in the performance of his official duties. The owner of such premises, or person having the superintendence of the same, who refuses to admit any appropriate TTB officer or permit him to examine such products shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by law for the offense.

###### § 40.43 Interference with administration.

Whoever, corruptly or by force or threats of force, endeavors to hinder or obstruct the administration of this part, or endeavors to intimidate or impede any TTB officer acting in his official capacity, or forcibly rescues or attempts to rescue or causes to be rescued any property, after it has been duly seized for forfeiture to the United States in connection with a violation of the internal revenue laws, shall be liable to the penalties prescribed by law.

###### § 40.44 Disposal of forfeited, condemned, and abandoned tobacco products.

A Federal, State, or local officer shall not sell or cause to be sold for consumption in the United States any forfeited, condemned, or abandoned tobacco products in his custody upon which the Federal tax has not been paid, if in his opinion the sale thereof will not bring a price equal to the tax due and payable thereon and the expenses incident to the sale thereof. Where the products are not sold the officer may deliver them to a Federal or State hospital or institution (if they are fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such products are sold they shall be released by the officer having custody thereof only after they are properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the appropriate TTB officer evidencing payment of tax on such products shall be presented to the officer having custody of the products, which tax shall be considered part of the sales price. Where tobacco products which have been packaged under the provisions of part 44 or part 45 of this chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser shall appropriately mark each package “Federal Tax Paid (date)” before the officer having custody of the products releases them:

###### § 40.45 Alternate methods or procedures.

A manufacturer of tobacco products, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part.

###### § 40.46 Emergency variations from requirements.

The appropriate TTB officer may approve methods of operation other than as specified in this part, where he finds that an emergency exists and the proposed variations from the specified requirements are necessary, and the proposed variations&#x2014;

(a) Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended by the prescribed specifications.

(b) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and

(c) Will not be contrary to any provision of law.

###### § 40.47 Other businesses within factory.

(a)The appropriate TTB officer may authorize such other businesses within the factory of a manufacturer of tobacco products as he finds will not jeopardize the revenue, will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and will not be contrary to law. A manufacturer of tobacco products who wishes to engage in another business within the factory must submit a written application to do so to the appropriate TTB officer. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer of tobacco products may not engage in such other business until the application is approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer must retain as part of its records any authorization provided under this section.

(b)A manufacturer of tobacco products may engage in certain activities related to processed tobacco without an approval under paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) A proprietor of a customs bonded manufacturing warehouse with respect to the operation of such warehouse;

(3) A retailer of tobacco products, such as a tobacconist, who takes taxpaid tobacco products out of the package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, in front of waiting customers and places the tobacco products into a different container for immediate delivery to those customers; or

(4) A person whose operations are limited to, and who holds a permit as, a manufacturer of processed tobacco.

(c)A permit to manufacture tobacco products will only be granted to those persons whose principal business activity under such permit will be the manufacture of tobacco products.

If no such certificate or other document is so required, a written statement, in duplicate, to that effect by such person will be sufficient for the purpose of this section.

###### § 40.66 Bond.

Every person, before commencing business as a manufacturer of tobacco products, shall file, in connection with his application for permit, a bond on TTB F 5200.25 or 5200.26, in duplicate, in accordance with the applicable provisions of subpart G of this part, conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of chapter 52, I.R.C., and regulations thereunder, including, but not limited to, the timely payment of taxes imposed by such chapter and penalties and interest in connection therewith for which he may become liable to the United States:That any person who, on the effective date of this part, October 1, 1961, has on file a valid and adequate bond, Form 2100, “Bond&#x2014;Manufacturer of Cigars and Cigarettes,” may continue, under such bond, the operations with respect to the permit to which that bond relates, in accordance with the provisions of this part.

###### § 40.69 Factory premises.

The premises to be used by a manufacturer of tobacco products as his factory may consist of more than one building, or portions of buildings, which need not be contiguous but must be located in the same city, town, or village: Except that, where the appropriate TTB officer determines that a building or portion of a building which is not within the city, town, or village, is so conveniently and closely situated to the general factory premises as to present no jeopardy to the revenue and as to offer no hindrance to the administration of this part, he may authorize the inclusion of such building or portion of building as part of the factory. The buildings or portions of buildings shall be described in the application for permit and the bond by number, street, and city, town, or village, and State. If any of the following conditions exist a diagram shall also be furnished, in duplicate, showing the information indicated:

###### § 40.70 Separation of and access to factory.

Where the factory consists of a portion of a building, or where portions of buildings are part of the factory, the factory shall be completely separated by walls from adjoining portions of the building. Such walls shall be securely constructed of substantial materials.

##### Subpart H [Reserved]

##### Subpart I - Claims

##### Subpart J - Records and Reports

###### § 41.181 Records of large cigars.

Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United States must keep such records as are necessary to establish and verify the sale price that applies to large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn).

(a)The importer must keep a record to show each sale price (as determined under § 41.39), which is applicable to large cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in the record within ten business days after such change in price. The record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic record within ten business days after such removal.

(b)The importer must keep a copy of each general announcement that is issued internally or to the trade about establishment or change of large cigar sale prices. If the copy does not show the actual date when issued it must be annotated to show this information.

(c)The importer must keep a copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to § 41.81.

(d)If an importer has so few import transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds that alternative records being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of this section.

###### § 41.182 Availability of records.

The records required under § 41.181 shall be kept by the importer at his usual place of business unless otherwise authorized in writing by the appropriate TTB officer, and shall be made available for inspection by the appropriate TTB officer upon his request. (For retention period, see § 41.22.)

Provided that a timely application is filed, the person may continue operations under the existing permit until TTB takes final action on the application for the new permit.

(a)Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(3) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every export warehouse proprietor.

(b)Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any export warehouse proprietor whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 44.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.

(c)All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563&#x2013;1 through 1.1563&#x2013;4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.

(d)Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(e)Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(b) Tobacco products manufactured in the United States and labeled for exportation under chapter 52 of title 26, U.S.C. may not be sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the United States unless such articles are removed from their export packaging and repackaged by the original manufacturer into new packaging that does not contain an export label. This applies to articles labeled for export even if the packaging or the appearance of such packaging to the consumer of such articles has been modified or altered by a person other than the original manufacturer so as to remove or conceal or attempt to remove or conceal (including by placement of a sticker over) the export label.

##### Subpart H [Reserved]

##### Subpart I - Floor Stocks Tax on Certain Tobacco Products, Cigarette Papers, and Cigarette Tubes Held for Sale on April 1, 2009

### Subchapter C - Firearms

#### PART 53 - MANUFACTURERS EXCISE TAXES - FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION

##### Subpart A - Introduction

###### § 53.1 Introduction.

The regulations in this part (part 53, subchapter C, chapter I, title 27, Code of Federal Regulations) are designated “Manufacturers Excise Taxes&#x2014;Firearms and Ammunition.” The regulations relate to the tax on the sale of firearms and ammunition imposed by section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to certain related administrative provisions of chapter 32, subchapter F, of the Code. Chapter 32, subchapter D of the Code imposes taxes on the sale or use by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of certain recreational equipment specified in that chapter. References in the regulations in this part to the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code” are references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (United States Code of 1986), as amended, unless otherwise indicated. References to a section or other provision of law are references to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise indicated.

###### § 53.2 Attachment of tax.

(a) For purposes of this part, the manufacturers excise tax generally attaches when the title to the article sold passes from the manufacturer to a purchaser.

(b) When title passes is dependent upon the intention of the parties as gathered from the contract of sale and the attendant circumstances. In the absence of expressed intention, the legal rules of presumption followed in the jurisdiction where the sale is made govern in determining when title passes.

(c) In the case of a sale on credit, the tax attaches whether or not the purchase price is actually collected.

(d) Where a consignor (such as a manufacturer) consigns articles to a consignee (such as a dealer), retaining ownership in them until they are disposed of by the consignee, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach until sale by the consignee. Where the relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer is that of principal and agent, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach, until sale by the dealer.

(e) In the case of a lease, an installment sale, a conditional sale, or a chattel mortgage arrangement or similar arrangement creating a security interest, a proportionate part of the tax attaches to each payment. See section 4217 and §§ 53.103 and 53.104 for a limitation on the amount of tax payable on lease payments.

(f) In the case of use by the manufacturer, the tax attaches at the time the use begins.

###### § 53.3 Exemption certificates.

Several provisions of this part, relating to sales exempt from manufacturers excise tax, require the manufacturer to obtain an exemption certificate from the purchaser to substantiate the exempt character of the sale. Any form of exemption certificate will be acceptable if it includes all the information required by the provisions of this part. These certificates are available as preprinted documents, which may be ordered by mailing a request to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, National Revenue Center, 550 Main Street, Room 1516, Cincinnati, OH 45202. The preprinted certificates may be reproduced as needed.

##### Subpart B - Definitions

###### § 53.11 Meaning of terms.

When used in this part and in forms prescribed under this part, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this section. Words in the plural form shall include the singular, and vice versa, and words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude other things not enumerated which are in the same general class or are otherwise within the scope thereof.

The Administrator, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.

An officer or employee of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) authorized to perform any functions relating to the administration or enforcement of this part by TTB Order 1135.53, Delegation of the Administrator's Authorities in 27 CFR Part 53, Manufacturers Excise Taxes&#x2014;Firearms and Ammunition.

A period of 3 calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.

The period which begins January 1 and ends on the following December 31.

For purposes of this part chapter 32 means section 4181, chapter 32, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Any transfer of funds effected by a taxpayer's financial institution, either directly or through a correspondent banking relationship, via the Federal Reserve Communications System (FRCS) or Fedwire to the Treasury Account at the Federal Reserve Bank.

The severance of an article from the mass of things belonging within the United States with the intention of uniting it with the mass of things belonging within some foreign country or within a possession of the United States.

The person named as shipper or consignor in the export bill of lading.

A bank or other financial institution, whether or not a member of the Federal Reserve System, which has access to the Federal Reserve Communications Systems (FRCS) or Fedwire. The “FRCS” or “Fedwire” is a communications network that allows Federal Reserve System member financial institutions to effect a transfer of funds for their customers (or other financial institutions) to the Treasury Account at the Federal Reserve Bank.

Any portable weapons, such as rifles, carbines, machine guns, shotguns, or fowling pieces, from which a shot, bullet, or other projectile may be discharged by an explosive.

Any person who brings a taxable article into the United States from a source outside the United States, or who withdraws such an article from a customs bonded warehouse for sale or use in the United States. If the nominal importer of a taxable article is not its beneficial owner (for example, the nominal importer is a customs broker engaged by the beneficial owner), the beneficial owner is the “importer” of the article for purposes of chapter 32 of the Code and is liable for tax on his sale or use of the article in the United States. See section 4219 of the Code and 27 CFR 53.121 for the circumstances under which sales by persons other than the manufacturer or importer are subject to the manufacturers excise tax.

A taxable article that is unassembled but complete as to all component parts.

Includes any person who produces a taxable article from scrap, salvage, or junk material, or from new or raw material, by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of an article or by combining or assembling two or more articles. The term also includes a “producer” and an “importer.” Under certain circumstances, as where a person manufactures or produces a taxable article for another person who furnishes materials under an agreement whereby the person who furnished the materials retains title thereto and to the finished article, the person for whom the taxable article is manufactured or produced, and not the person who actually manufactures or produces it, will be considered the manufacturer.

A manufacturer who sells a taxable article in a knockdown condition is liable for the tax as a manufacturer. Whether the person who buys such component parts or accessories and assembles a taxable article from them will be liable for tax as a manufacturer of a taxable article will depend on the relative amount of labor, material, and overhead required to assemble the completed article and on whether the article is assembled for business or personal use.

An individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation. When used in connection with penalties, seizures, and forfeitures, the term includes an officer or employee of a partnership, who as an officer, employee or member, is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.

Small projectile firearms which have a short one-hand stock or butt at an angle to the line of bore and a short barrel or barrels, and which are designed, made, and intended to be aimed and fired from one hand. The term does not include gadget devices, guns altered or converted to resemble pistols, or small portable guns erroneously referred to as pistols, as, for example, Nazi belt buckle pistols, glove pistols, or one-hand stock guns firing fixed shotgun or fixed rifle ammunition.

Includes Guam, the Midway Islands, Palmyra, the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.

Includes a lessee where the lessor is also the manufacturer of the article.

Small projectile firearms of the pistol type, having a breech-loading chambered cylinder so arranged that the cocking of the hammer or movement of the trigger rotates it and brings the next cartridge in line with the barrel for firing.

An agreement whereby the seller transfers the property (that is, the title or the substantial incidents of ownership in goods) to the buyer for a consideration called the price, which may consist of money, services, or other things.

The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.

Include any article consisting of a projectile, explosive, and container that is designed, assembled, and ready for use without further manufacture in firearms, pistols or revolvers. A person who reloads used shell or cartridge casings is a manufacturer of shells or cartridges within the meaning of section 4181 if such reloaded shells or cartridges are sold by the reloader. However, the reloader is not a manufacturer of shells or cartridges if, in return for a fee and expenses, he reloads casings of shells or cartridges submitted by a customer and returns the reloaded shells or cartridges with the identical casings provided by the customer to that customer. Under such circumstances, the customer would be the manufacturer of the shells or cartridges and may be liable for tax on the sale of articles. See section 4218 of the Code and § 53.112.

Any article taxable under section 4181 of the Code.

The Department of Treasury's General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Includes a lessor where the lessor is also the manufacturer of the article.

The appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when&#x2014;

(1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;

(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and

(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax shall be authorized under this paragraph.

(b) Where the taxpayer desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, a written application to do so must be submitted. The application must specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure and must set forth the reasons therefor.

Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such authorization.

###### § 53.24 Records.

(a)&#x2014;(1)The records required by the regulations in this part shall be kept accurately, but no particular form is required for keeping the records. Such forms and systems of accounting shall be used as will enable appropriate TTB officers to ascertain whether liability for tax is incurred and, if so, the amount thereof.

(2) [Reserved]

(b)Every person who is required, by the regulations in this part or by instructions applicable to any form prescribed thereunder, to keep any copy of any return, schedule, statement, or other document, shall keep such copy as a part of the records.

##### Subparts D-F [Reserved]

##### Subpart G - Tax Rates

(a)Section 4181 of the Code imposes a tax on the sale of the following articles by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof:

(1) Pistols;

(2) Revolvers;

(3) Firearms (other than pistols and revolvers); and

(4) Shells and cartridges.

(b)&#x2014;(1)No tax is imposed by section 4181 of the Code on the sale of parts or accessories of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges when sold separately or when sold with a complete firearm for use as spare parts or accessories. The tax does attach, however, to sales of completed firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges, and to sale of such articles that, although in knockdown condition, are complete as to all component parts.

(2)Component parts are items that would ordinarily be attached to a firearm during use and, in the ordinary course of trade, are packaged with the firearm at the time of sale by the manufacturer or importer. All component parts for firearms are includible in the price for which the article is sold.

(3)Parts sold with firearms that duplicate component parts that are not includible in the price for which the article is sold.

(4)Items that are not designed to be attached to a firearm during use or that are not, in the ordinary course of trade, provided with the firearm at the time of the sale by the manufacturer or importer are not includible in the price for which the article is sold.

(5)&#x2014;(i)The following examples are provided as guidelines and are not meant to be all inclusive.

(ii)Component parts include items such as a frame or receiver, breech mechanism, trigger mechanism, barrel, buttstock, forestock, handguard, grips, buttplate, fore end cap, trigger guard, sight or set of sights (iron or optical), sight mount or set of sight mounts, a choke, a flash hider, a muzzle brake, a magazine, a set of sling swivels, and/or an attachable ramrod for muzzle loading firearms when provided by the manufacturer or importer for use with the firearm in the ordinary course of commercial trade. Component parts also include any part provided with the firearm that would affect the tax status of the firearm, such as an attachable shoulder stock.

(iii)Nontaxable parts include items such as extra barrels, extra sights, optical sights and mounts (in addition to iron sights), spare magazines, spare cylinders, extra choke tubes, and spare pins.

(iv)Nontaxable accessories include items such as cleaning equipment, slings, slip on recoil pads (in addition to standard buttplate), tools, gun cases for storage or transportation, separate items such as knives, belt buckles, or medallions. Nontaxable accessories also include optional items purchased by the customer at the time of retail sale that do not change the tax classification of the firearm, such as telescopic sights and mounts, recoil pads, slings, sling swivels, chokes, and flash hiders/muzzle brakes of a type not provided by the manufacturer or importer of the firearm in the ordinary course of commercial trade.

(c)Tax is imposed on the sale of the articles specified in section 4181 of the Code at the rates indicated below.

(d)The tax is computed by applying to the price for which the article is sold the applicable rate. For definition of the term “price” see section 4216 of the Code and the regulations contained in subpart J of this part.

(e)The tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code is payable by the manufacturer, producer, or importer making the sale.

###### § 53.62 Exemptions.

(a)Section 4182(a) provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of any firearms on which the tax imposed by section 5811 of the Code (relating to tax on the transfer of machine guns, short-barreled firearms, and other weapons) has been paid. Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming such an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Section 4182(b) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges that are purchased with funds appropriated for a military department of the United States. For this purpose, the term “military department” means the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force. Included in the Department of the Navy are naval aviation and the Marine Corps.

(2)Section 655, title 14, U.S.C., provides that no tax on the sale or transfer of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges may be imposed on such articles when bought with funds appropriated for the United States Coast Guard.

(3)Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code by reason of section 4182(b) and section 655, title 14 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption. Generally, clearly identified orders or contracts of a military department signed by an authorized officer of the military department will be sufficient to establish the right to the exemption. In the absence of such orders or contracts, a statement, signed by an authorized officer of a military department or the Coast Guard, that the prescribed articles were purchased with funds appropriated for that military department or the Coast Guard will constitute satisfactory evidence of the right to an exemption.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Section 4182(c) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to any pistol, revolver, or firearm manufactured, produced, or imported by a person who manufactures, produces, and imports less than an aggregate of 50 of those articles during the calendar year, regardless of when the articles are sold.

(2)All persons treated as a single employer for purposes of subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Code are treated as one person for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3)The exemption described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to articles sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer after September 30, 2005. Application of this exemption is based on the calendar year in which the manufacture, production, or importation of the articles in question took place and does not depend on when the sale occurs. In addition, each calendar year stands alone for purposes of applying the exemption.

###### § 53.63 Other tax-free sales.

For provisions relating to tax-free sales of firearms and ammunition see:

(a) Section 4221 and 27 CFR 53.131, “Tax-free sales; general rule”.

(b) Section 4223 and 27 CFR 53.132, “Tax-free sale of articles to be used for, or resold for, further manufacture”.

(c) Section 4222 and 27 CFR 53.140, “Registration”.

##### Subparts H-I [Reserved]

##### Subpart J - Special Provisions Applicable to Manufacturers Taxes

###### § 53.91 Charges to be included in sale price.

(a)The “price” for which an article is sold includes the total consideration paid for the article, whether that consideration is in the form of money, services, or other things. However, for purposes of the taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code, certain collateral charges made in connection with the sale of a taxable article must be included in the taxable sale price, whereas others may be excluded. Any charge which is required by a manufacturer, producer, or importer to be paid as a condition of its sale of a taxable article and which is not attributable to an expense falling within one of the exclusions provided in section 4216 of the Code or the regulations thereunder is includable in the taxable sale price. It is immaterial for this purpose that the charge may be paid to a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or that it may be separately billed to the purchaser as a charge earmarked for expenses incurred or to be incurred in his behalf, such as charges for demonstration or display of the article, for sales promotion programs, or otherwise. With respect to the rules relating to exclusion of charges for local advertising of a manufacturer's products, see section 4216(e) of the Code and § 53.100. In the case of sales on credit, a carrying, finance, or service charge is excludable from the sale price if it is reasonably related to the costs of carrying the deferred portion of the sale price (such as interest on the deferred portion of the sale price, expenses of bookkeeping necessary to keep the records of such sales, and expenses of correspondence and other communication in connection with collection).

(b)Separate charges for tools and dies used in the manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a “production output” basis, should be included in the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a “production output” basis), shall be included in determining the sale price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax.

(c)A charge for a warranty of an article which the manufacturer, producer, or importer requires the purchaser to pay in order to obtain the article shall be included in the sale price of the article on which the tax is computed. On the other hand, a charge for a warranty of a taxable article paid at the purchaser's option shall not be included in the sale price for purposes of computing tax thereon.

(d)Any charge by the manufacturer, producer, or importer for coverings and containers of whatever nature used to pack an article for shipment shall be included as part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the tax, whether or not the charges are identified as such on the invoice or are billed separately. Even though there is an agreement that the manufacturer, producer, or importer will repay all or a portion of the charge for the coverings or containers upon the return thereof, the full charge nevertheless shall be included in the sale price. It is immaterial whether the charge made at the time of sale is more or less than the actual value of the covering or container. See § 53.173(b)(4) for provisions relating to the claiming of a credit or refund in the case of a price readjustment due to the return or repossession of a covering or container. Packing charges are to be included in the sale price whether the charges cover normal packing or special packing services, such as for extra protection of the article or for odd-lot quantities. This rule shall apply whether the packing services are initiated by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or are furnished at the request of the purchaser and whether the packing is performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or by another person at his request. If the purchaser supplies packing materials, the fair market value of such materials must be included in the tax base when computing tax liability on the sale of the article.

(e)Where a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. Normally, the taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer. Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.

###### § 53.92 Exclusions from sale price.

(a)&#x2014;(1)The tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of an article is not part of the taxable sale price of the article. Thus, if a manufacturer computes the tax on a sale price which is determined without regard to the tax, and it charges the proper tax as a separate item, the amount of tax so charged does not become a part of the taxable sale price and no tax is due on the tax so charged. Where no separate charge is made as tax, it will be presumed that the price charged to the purchaser for the article includes the proper tax, and the proper percentage of such price will be allocated to the tax.

(2)If an article subject to tax at the rate of 10 percent is sold for $100 and an additional item of $10 is billed as tax, $100 is the taxable selling price and $10 is the amount of tax due thereon. However, if the article is sold for $100 with no separate billing or indication of the amount of the tax, it will be presumed that the tax is included in the $100, and a computation will be necessary to determine what portion of the total amount represents the sale price of the article and what portion represents the tax. The computation is as follows:

(b)&#x2014;(1)Charges for transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and other expenses actually incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale shall be excluded from the sale price in computing the tax. Such charges include all items of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and similar expense incurred after shipment to a customer begins, in response to the customer's order, pursuant to a bona fide sale. However, costs of such nature incurred by a manufacturer, producer, or importer in transporting, in the normal course of business and for its benefit and convenience, articles from a factory or port of entry to a warehouse or other facility (regardless of the location of such warehouse or facility) are not considered as being incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, and charges therefor cannot be excluded from the sale price in computing tax liability. Similarly, an allowance granted by a manufacturer as reimbursement for expenses incurred by the purchaser in shipping used articles to the manufacturer for credit against the purchase price of taxable articles shall not be excluded from the sale price when computing tax due on the sale of the taxable articles. In any event, no charge may be excluded from the sale price unless the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are complied with. Said conditions are prescribed under the authority granted the Secretary in section 4216(a) of the Code.

(2)Where a separate charge is made for transportation or other expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to the purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, there shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price subject to tax only that portion of the charge which represents the actual expenses incurred for the transportation or other excludable expenses. Where a separate charge is less than the actual expense, the difference is presumed to be included in the billed price. Such difference, together with the separate charge, shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price on which the tax is computed. Similarly, where no separate charge is made but the manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs an expense of the type to which this paragraph has application, the amount of such expense actually incurred shall be excluded from the sale price on which the tax is computed. Where transportation expense is incurred in conjunction with a shipment composed of both taxable and nontaxable articles, only the portion of the expense allocable to the taxable articles shall be excludable. In general, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that another method reasonably apportions such freight expense between taxable and nontaxable articles, such expense should be apportioned on the basis of the relative weights (or, if available, the relative published tariff rates) applicable to the taxable and nontaxable articles. Where it is not feasible to apportion such expense on the basis of relative weights or tariff rates, the expense shall be apportioned on another reasonable basis; for example, in the case of a shipment including both taxable and nontaxable articles which are subject to the same tariff rate, it may be appropriate to apportion the transportation expense on the basis of the relative sale prices. A charge for insurance in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser is considered to represent an expense actually incurred only to the extent that an amount equivalent to such charge is paid or payable by the manufacturer to a person authorized to assume such insurance risk.

(3)For purposes of computing the taxable sale price of articles, it is immaterial whether the transportation, delivery, or other services of the type to which this paragraph has application are performed by a common carrier or independent agency for or on behalf of the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or are performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the use of its own vehicles or other facilities. Thus, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer performs the transportation, delivery, or other services with its equipment, tools, employees, etc., the cost of such services allocable to the sale of the taxable article shall be excluded. In determining whether an expense is an excludable transportation or delivery expense, only those expenses incurred by reason of the fact that the purchaser accepts delivery at some point other than the manufacturer's place of business shall be considered excludable transportation or delivery expenses. All expenses incurred in placing an article packed, ready for shipment on the loading dock at the manufacturer's factory are not excludable transportation or delivery expenses. An allowance granted by the manufacturer, producer, or importer to the purchaser for transportation, delivery, or other expenses incurred or to be incurred by the purchaser in connection with the sale shall be excluded in computing the taxable sale price, if charges for similar expenses would be excludable if incurred by the manufacturer.

(4)Every manufacturer, producer, or importer making sales of taxable articles shall keep records which will disclose the amount of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation or other expense actually incurred by it in connection with the delivery of a taxable article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale.

(c)A charge or expense not within the scope of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, whether or not separately stated, may not be excluded in computing the taxable sale price unless it can be shown by adequate records that the charge or expense is not properly included as a manufacturing or selling expense or is in no way incidental to placing the article in condition packed ready for shipment. Commissions to manufacturers' agents, or allowances, payments, or adjustments made to, and for the benefit of, persons other than the purchaser may not be excluded or deducted, under any condition, in computing the sale price upon which the tax is computed.

###### § 53.93 Other items relating to tax on sale price.

(a)If, in connection with the sale of an article subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, a manufacturer receives from its vendee another article in exchange, the tax on the manufacturer's sale shall be computed on the basis of the amount allowed for the article received from the vendee, plus any additional amount charged the vendee.

(b)If an article, subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, is returned to the manufacturer by reason of the failure of the article under a warranty as to its quality or service, and a new article is given by the manufacturer, free, or at a reduced price, the tax on the new article shall be computed on the actual amount, if any, to be paid to the manufacturer for the new article. See § 53.174(b) for the circumstances under which the allowance made by the manufacturer, producer, or importer upon the return of the first article constitutes a price readjustment of the sale price of the first article and the extent, if any, to which a credit may be allowed, or refund made, of the tax paid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of the first article.

(c)Readjustment in sale price (such as allowable discounts, rebates, bonuses, etc.) cannot be anticipated. The tax must be based upon the original price unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of the period for which the tax upon the sale is returned. However, if the price upon which the tax was computed is subsequently readjusted, credit may be taken against the tax due on a subsequent return or a claim for refund filed as provided by section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and §§ 53.174&#x2013;53.176.

###### § 53.94 Constructive sale price; scope and application.

(a)Section 4216(b) of the Code pertains to those taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code that are based on the price for which an article is sold, and contains the provisions for constructing a tax base other than the actual sale price of the article, under certain defined conditions.

(b)(1) Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code applies to:

(i) Arm's-length sales at retail or on consignment, other than those sales at retail and to retailers to which section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply; and

(ii) Sales otherwise than at arm's length, and at less than fair market price.

(2) Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code applies generally to arm's-length sales of an article at retail or to retailers, or both, where the manufacturer also sells the same article to wholesale distributors.

(3) Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a formula for determining a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between members of an affiliated group of corporations (as “affiliated group” is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code) in those instances where the purchasing corporation regularly resells to retailers but does not regularly resell to wholesale distributors, and except for situations where section 4216(b)(4) of the Code applies.

(4) Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a special method for computing a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between affiliated corporations where the purchasing corporation sells only to retailers, and the normal method of selling within the industry is for manufacturers to sell to wholesale distributors.

(c)For purposes of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94&#x2013;53.97 and unless otherwise indicated:

(1)A “sale at retail,” or a “retail sale”, is a sale of an article to a purchaser who intends to use or lease the article rather than resell it. The fact that articles are sold in wholesale lots, or at wholesale prices, will not change the character of such sales as “sales at retail” if the purchaser is not engaged in the business of reselling such articles, and acquires them for the purpose of using them rather than reselling them.

(2)A “retail dealer”, or “retailer”, is a person engaged in the business of selling articles at retail.

(3)The term “wholesale distributor” means a person engaged in the business of selling articles to persons engaged in the business of reselling such articles.

###### § 53.95 Constructive sale price; basic rules.

(a)Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code sets forth the conditions that require the Secretary to construct a sale price on which to compute a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which an article is sold. The section requires a constructive sale price to be established where a taxable article is:

(1) Sold at retail;

(2) Sold while on consignment; or,

(3) Sold otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction at less than fair market price.

(b)Section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code relates to the determination of a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles sold at arm's-length and at retail. In the case of such sales, the constructive sale price is the highest price for which such articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. If the constructive sale price is less than the actual sale price, the constructive sale price shall be used as the tax base. If the constructive sale price is not less than the actual sale price, the actual sale price shall be considered as not less than fair market, and shall be used as the tax base. In determining the highest price for which articles are sold by manufacturers to wholesale distributors, there must be taken into consideration the normal industry practices with respect to inclusions and exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined by the Secretary, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply in those instances where the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.

(c)As in the case of sales at retail, the constructive sale price for sales on consignment shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course for trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph, an article is considered to be sold on consignment if it is sold while it is on consignment to a person which has the right to sell, and does sell, such article in its own name, but never receives title to the article from the manufacturer. Ordinarily, the constructive sale price of an article sold on consignment is the net price received by the manufacturer from the consignee. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply if the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.

(d)For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code and this paragraph, a sale is considered to be made under circumstances otherwise than at “arm's-length” if:

(1) One of the parties is controlled (in law or in fact) by the other, or there is common control, whether or not such control is actually exercised to influence the sale price, or

(2) The sale is made pursuant to special arrangements between a manufacturer and a purchaser.

###### § 53.96 Constructive sale price; special rule for arm's-length sales.

(a)Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code provides a special rule under which a manufacturer shall determine a constructive sale price for this sale of taxable articles at retail, and to retail dealers, under certain conditions. The rule is applicable where:

(1) The manufacturer regularly sells such articles at retail, or to retailers, or both, as the case may be,

(2) The manufacturer also regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions, and the manufacturer establishes that its prices in such cases are determined without regard to any benefit to be derived under section 4216(b)(2) of the Code, and

(3) The transactions are arm's-length transactions.

(4) A manufacturer meeting the foregoing requirements shall base its tax liability for sales at retail and sales to retailers on the lower of its actual sale price or the highest price for which it sells the same articles under the same conditions to wholesale distributors.

(b)For purposes of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and this section:

(1)“Actual sale price” means the actual selling price for an article determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale. Accordingly, such price must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code, and any price adjustments described in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.

(2)The “highest price” charged wholesale distributors for an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, is the highest price at which the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article to wholesale distributors, determined without regard to quantity. Such price shall be determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale with respect to the inclusions and exclusions under sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code; however, since the price is to be a “highest” price, no further adjustment may be made for price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.

(3)An article is considered to be sold “regularly” at retail or to retailers if sales are made at retail or to retailers periodically and recurringly as a regular part of the seller's business. If a seller makes only isolated or casual sales of an article at retail or to retailers, it is not considered to be selling “regularly” at retail or to retailers. Similarly, a manufacturer is considered to be making regular sales of an article to one or more distributors if it sells the article to at least one distributor periodically and recurringly as a regular part of its business.

(4)In the absence of a showing to the appropriate TTB officer of a more appropriate manner of determining the normal method of sales within an industry which is practical in application, the normal method of sales within an industry shall be regarded as not being at retail or to retailers, or both, if the industry dollar volume of sales which are at retail or to retailers, or both, is less than half the total industry dollar volume of sales at all levels of distribution by manufacturers, producers, or importers, including sales to other manufacturers, producers, or importers.

###### § 53.97 Constructive sale price; affiliated corporations.

(a)Sections 4216(b) (3) and (4) of the Code establish procedures for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code for sales between corporations that are members of the same “affiliated group”, as that term is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code.

(b)Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instances where:

(1) A manufacturer, producer or importer regularly sells a taxable article to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producers or importer, and

(2) The wholesale distributor regularly sells such article to one or more independent retailers, but does not regularly sell to wholesale distributors. Under such circumstances the constructive sale price for the article shall be an amount equal to 90 percent of the lowest price for which the distributor regularly sells the article in arm's-length transactions to such independent retailers. Once the constructive sale price has been determined, no adjustment shall be made for inclusions or exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code or price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code. If both sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4) of the Code apply with respect to the sale of an article, the constructive sale price for such article shall be the lower of the prices computed under sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4).

(c)Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instance where:

(1) A manufacturer, producer, or importer regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) a taxable article only to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producer, or importer,

(2) The distributor regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) such article only to retail dealers, and

(3) The normal method of sales for such articles within the industry is to sell such articles in arm's-length transactions to wholesale distributors.

(4) Under section 4216(b)(4) of the Code, the constructive sale price of such article shall be the median price at which the distributor, at the time of the sale by the manufacturer, resells the article to retail dealers, reduced by a percentage of such price equal to the percentage which:

(i) The difference between the median price for which comparable articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers of producers thereof, and the median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers, is of

(ii) The median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers.

(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the “median price” for which an article is sold at a particular level of distribution is the price midway between the highest and lowest prices charged vendees at the particular level of distribution. Where only one price is charged at a level of distribution, “median price” is equivalent to “actual price”. All sale prices referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are prices that must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined under these paragraphs, no further adjustment of such price is allowed.

(d)The application of section 4216(b)(4) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

(e)In addition to other considerations, in determining a “lowest price” for purposes of sections 4216(b) (1) and (3) of the Code and § 53.97, such price shall be determined:

(1) Without requiring that a given percentage of sales be made at that price (provided that the volume of sales made at that price is great enough to indicate that those sales have not been engaged in primarily to establish a lower tax base), and

(2) Without including any charge for a fixed amount that the purchaser has an unconditional right to recover on the basis of a contractual arrangement existing at the time of sale.

(f)For purposes of this section and paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 4216(b) of the Code, the term “regularly sells” has the same meaning as that accorded the term “regular sales” in § 53.96(b)(3), and the term “normal method of sales in the industry” has the same meaning as accorded that term in § 53.96(b)(4).

###### § 53.98 Computation of tax on leases and installment sales.

(a)When a taxable article is leased by a manufacturer, producer, or importer, liability for tax is incurred, except as provided by section 4217(b) of the Code and § 53.104, on each payment made with respect to such lease. Tax is payable on each lease payment as long as the article is leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The tax payable with respect to each lease payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the lease payment is due. If the article is subsequently sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, the tax applies also to such sale, without regard to the tax paid when the article was leased. For definition of the term “lease”, see § 53.103.

(b)When a taxable article is sold under an installment payment contract with title reserved in the seller, or under a conditional sale contract, chattel mortgage arrangement or other arrangement creating a security interest with payments to be made in installments, tax shall be computed and paid on each payment made by the purchaser. The tax payable with each payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the payment is due. The part of each payment that is subject to tax is that portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total charge for the article that is subject to tax. For example, if the total charge for the article is $1,000, and of the total amount charged only 90 percent thereof, or $900, is subject to tax by reason of exclusions, then only 90 percent of the installment payment is subject to tax. If the tax base is a constructive sale price computed under section 4216(b) of the Code that is less than the actual sale price of the article, the portion of each payment subject to tax is the percentage of such payment equal to the percentage that the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price. For example, if an article is sold at retail for $100, and the constructive sale price for such an article computed under the provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code is $75, the percentage which the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price is 75 percent. Accordingly, only 75 percent of each installment payment is subject to tax.

(c)Where articles are sold on credit under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the entire tax shall be reported and paid with the return covering the period in which the sale is made, even though the price may not be paid to the manufacturer, producer, or importer until a later date, or not paid at all.

###### § 53.99 Sales of installment accounts.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in case of a sale or other disposition by a manufacturer, producer, or importer of an installment account of the type specified in section 4216(c) of the Code, the tax shall not apply to subsequent installment payments on such account. Instead, there shall be paid an amount equal to the difference between the tax previously paid on such installment account and the total tax computed by applying:

(1) To each installment due before the sale of the installment account, the rate of tax applicable at the time payment thereof was due, and

(2) To each installment, the time for payment of which has not arrived, the rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such installment is due. However, see paragraph (b) of this section if the sale is made in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. The tax due under this paragraph shall be included in the return for the period in which the account is sold.

(b)In the case of a sale of an installment account of a manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the amount of tax due shall be computed and paid as provided in paragraph (a) of this section but shall not exceed the amount of tax computed by multiplying:

(1) The proportionate share of the amount for which such accounts are sold which is allocable to each unpaid installment payment, by

(2) The rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such payment is due.

(c)Where a manufacturer, producer, or importer retains title to an installment account but turns it over to another person for collection on a fee basis, no sale of such account (or other disposition as contemplated in section 4216(d) of the Code) has been made. The tax shall continue to be paid as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code.

(d)Where an installment account which has been sold or otherwise disposed of is returned to the manufacturer, producer, or importer who sold it under an agreement under which the account was sold, and credit or refund has been allowed under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and § 53.183, the manufacturer, producer, or importer shall pay tax as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code and § 53.98 on any subsequent payments made on such returned installment account until such time as there shall have been paid the total tax liability with respect to the account as computed under paragraph (a) of this section.

(e)The sum of the amounts payable under this section and § 53.98 or an installment account shall not exceed the total amount of tax which would be payable if such installment account had not been sold or otherwise disposed of (computed as provided in subsection (c)).

###### § 53.100 Exclusion of local advertising charges from sale price.

(a)Section 4216(e) of the Code deals with the treatment to be accorded charges made by a manufacturer for, and reimbursements by a manufacturer or expenditures in connection with the advertising of certain articles subject to excise tax under chapter 32 of the Code. Section 4216(e) of the Code provides an exclusion (which is in addition to the exclusions provided by section 4216(a) of the Code and § 53.92) in respect of charges for local advertising, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of determining the price for which an article is sold. See paragraph (c) of this section. The exclusion provided by section 4216(e) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section has application only if the advertising is broadcast over a radio or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster. Section 4216(e) of the Code also provides an overall limitation in respect of the sum of the amount of the exclusions from price as charges for local advertising and the amount of the readjustments authorized under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code (relating to credits or refunds for price readjustments) in respect of reimbursements by a manufacturer of expenditures for local advertising. See § 53.101. For provisions prohibiting exclusion from price or readjustment of price in respect of charges for, and reimbursements of expenditures for, advertising other than local advertising, see § 53.102.

(b)&#x2014;(1)For purposes of the regulations under sections 4216(e) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code (§§ 53.100&#x2013;53.102 and 53.173&#x2013;53.176), the term “local advertising” means advertising which relates to an article with respect to which tax is imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold and which:

(i) Is initiated or obtained by the purchaser or any subsequent vendee,

(ii) Names the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 and states the location at which such article may be purchased at retail, and

(iii) Is broadcast over a radio station or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.

(2)For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must be initiated or obtained by one or more of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article (wholesale distributor, jobber, dealer, etc.) who purchased the article for resale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the manufacturer is not considered to be one of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article. In general, advertising of an article is considered to be initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article if any such person:

(i) Takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, or

(ii) Contracts for the placement of the advertising.

(3)To meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must identify the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 of the Code and give the location or locations at which the article may be purchased at retail. All products taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code shall be considered to be an “article” for purposes of the preceding sentence. No specific method or means of identification is prescribed. The identification of the article may be made through the use of the name of the manufacturer or the use of an established trade-mark, such as a seal, picture, letter or letters, etc., or a combination thereof. The advertising must identify the particular retail establishment or establishments at which the article may be purchased at retail but need not specify the location of any such establishment in terms of the number by which the premises are designated or the name of the street on which the retail premises are situated. However, the location of the retail premises must be described sufficiently, as, for example, by reference to a particular named shopping area or shopping center, to enable customers to find the retail establishment.

(4)Where an advertisement identifies more than one article, and all such articles are not taxable, or are not taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, a reasonable allocation of the cost of the advertisement must be made among:

(i) Articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code, and

(ii) Articles which are not taxable under chapter 32 of the Code.

(5)The termas used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are commonly understood to be newspapers and which are printed and distributed periodically at daily, weekly, or other short intervals for the dissemination of news of a general character and of a general interest. The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers, or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. Neither does the term include any publication which is issued to supply information on certain subjects of interest to particular groups unless such publication otherwise qualifies as a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be news of a general character and of a general interest.

(6)The termas used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are:

(i) Commonly understood to be magazines,

(ii) Printed and distributed periodically at least twice a year, and

(iii) Published for the dissemination of information of a general nature or of special interest to particular groups.

(iv) The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a magazine within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be information of a general nature or information of special interest to particular groups within the contemplation of paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.

(7)The term “outdoor advertising sign or poster”, as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, means a sign or poster displaying advertising matter, which is located outside of a roofed enclosure. This term includes both signs or posters on billboards, whether placed on or affixed to land, buildings, or other structures, and those which are displayed on or attached to moving objects, provided the signs or posters are located outside of a roofed enclosure. The term “roofed enclosure” means a roof structure which is enclosed on more than one-half of its sides by walls, fences, or other barriers.

(c)&#x2014;(1)A charge for local advertising which is required by a manufacturer to be paid as a condition to his sale of an article is not a part of the taxable price of the article, to the extent that such charge meets each of the following conditions and limitations:

(i) Such charge does not exceed 5 percent of the difference between:

(A) An amount which would constitute the taxable price of the article (computed at the time of the sale of the article) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and

(B) The amount of any separate charge for local advertising, whatever the amount of such charge may be,

(ii) Such charge is specifically shown as a separate charge for local advertising on the invoice or statement covering the sale of the article.

(iii) Such charge is billed by the manufacturer with the intention on his part of repaying the amount of the charge to the person purchasing the article from him, or to any person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact of such intention will be assumed in all cases where the manufacturer and his vendees are parties to an advertising plan which calls for such repayments, or the manufacturer can otherwise establish that the vendees to whom he bills such charges understand and expect that such repayments will be made.

(2)To the extent that charges for local advertising meet the conditions and limitations stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, such charge is excludable in computing the taxable price of the article in respect of which the charge was made. However, the exclusion will cease to apply in respect of any part of such charge which the manufacturer fails to repay before May 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the article was sold, to the person who purchased the article from him, or to some other person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. If, before such May 1, any part of the charge so excluded has not been so repaid, the manufacturer becomes liable for tax on such May 1 in the same manner as if an article taxable under such section of the Code had been sold by him on such May 1 at a taxable price equivalent to that part of the charge not so repaid. However, see paragraph (b)(2) of § 53.175, relating to price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges are not repaid before such May 1 but are subsequently paid over by the manufacturer to his vendees in reimbursement of costs for local advertising. For provisions relating to the method of determining whether a payment by a manufacturer is or is not attributable to an excluded local advertising charge, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 53.101. In any case where the payment is determined to be attributable to such a charge, the date of the sale in connection with which the charge was made shall be determined on a first-in-first-out basis in respect of the vendee to whom the charge was billed by the manufacturer.

###### § 53.101 Limitation on aggregate of exclusions and price readjustments.

(a)The sum of the amount excluded from taxable price in respect of charges for local advertising, as provided in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, plus the amount of the readjustments for which credits or refunds may be claimed in respect of local advertising, as provided in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.175, is subject to an overall 5 percent limitation. This limitation applies to each manufacturer, as of the close of each calendar quarter, in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code which were sold by such manufacturer in such quarter (and the preceding quarter or quarters, if any, in the calendar year).

(b)&#x2014;(1)The limitation prescribed by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code (the “overall 5 percent limitation” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as to the total of the exclusions from price and readjustments of price which may be claimed for local advertising in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code shall be computed as of the close of each calendar quarter of the calendar year. The overall 5 percent limitation is 5 percent of the difference between:

(i) The amount which would constitute the total taxable price (computed at the time of sale) of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code sold by the manufacturer during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and

(ii) The total of all amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising of such articles (whatever the amount of any single charge of the total of all charges).

(iii) In making the computations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, credits or refunds under section 6416(b) of the Code of tax paid on the sale of any such articles are to be disregarded and articles sold tax-free by the manufacturer are to be excluded. The amount by which the overall 5 percent limitation computed as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code exceeds the sum of the charges for local advertising excluded in computing the taxable price and the amount of reimbursements for local advertising of such articles made during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, in respect of which credit or refund has been claimed, represents the unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation. Such unused portion is the maximum amount of reimbursements for local advertising in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed at the close of the particular calendar quarter, subject to the applicable conditions and limitations governing the right to claim a credit or refund in respect of local advertising (see § 53.175). The unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year in respect of which credit or refund may not be claimed as of the close of such quarter must be disregarded in computing the overall 5 percent limitation for any subsequent calendar quarter. Moreover, the amount of any reimbursements for local advertising made by a manufacturer in a calendar year which is in excess of the amount of such reimbursements in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed, within the overall limitation, as of the close of the calendar year, may not subsequently serve as the basis for a credit or refund.

(2)If during the portion of the calendar year ending with the date as of which the overall 5 percent limitation is being computed the amount of the local advertising charge separately billed by the manufacturer has not, in respect of any sale of any articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, exceeded the amount excludable pursuant to § 53.100 in computing taxable price, the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under such section is 5 percent of the total taxable price (computed at the time of the sale) of all such articles sold taxpaid during the calendar year.

(3)If a manufacturer makes contributions to a local advertising program in connection with which he makes excludable local advertising charges, it is necessary that reimbursements by the manufacturer for local advertising be attributed to the charges for local advertising, to the manufacturer's contributions, or allocated between them. Whether an amount paid by a manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising is or is not a repayment of a local advertising charge which was excluded from taxable price under section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, shall be determined on the basis of an allocation made under the agreement between the manufacturer and his vendee (or any subsequent vendee).

(c)The application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

###### § 53.102 No exclusion or readjustment for other advertising charges or reimbursements.

(a)No exclusion in computing the taxable price of any article sold by the manufacturer may be allowed in respect of any charge for advertising if, and to the extent that, such charge:

(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 53.100, or

(2) Does not satisfy all of the conditions and limitations stated in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c) of § 53.100.

(b)No credit or refund under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code may be allowed in respect of any amount which was included in the taxable price of an article sold by the manufacturer and which was later paid by him to his vendee in reimbursement of costs incurred for advertising, if, and to the extent that, the amount so paid:

(1) Is for advertising which does not qualify as local advertising within the meaning of section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and paragraph (b) of § 53.100, or

(2) Is not within the limitation provided in section 4216(e)(2) of the Code, as computed in accordance with § 53.101, as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the amount is so paid over or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter in the same calendar year. See, however, § 53.175, relating to redetermination of price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges excluded from taxable price in one calendar year become taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.

###### § 53.103 Lease considered as sale.

For purposes of chapter 32 of the Code, the lease of an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer shall be considered a sale of the article. The termmeans a contract or agreement, written or verbal, which gives the lessee an exclusive, continuous right to the possession or use of a particular article for a period of time. The term includes any renewal or extension of a lease or any subsequent lease of the article.

###### § 53.104 Limitation on amount of tax applicable to certain leases.

(a)Section 4217(b) of the Code provides for a limitation on the amount of tax that shall apply to the lease, any renewal, or further lease, of an article which, if sold, would be subject to tax on the basis of sale price. Such limitation on the amount of the tax applies with respect to the lease of an article only if, at the time of making the lease, the lessor is engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of article. In case of a lease to which section 4217(b) of the Code does not apply, tax shall be computed and paid as provided in section 4216(c) of the Code and paragraph (a) of § 53.98.

(b)The lessor will be regarded as being engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of an article as the one being leased if it periodically and recurringly makes bona fide offers for sale of such articles in the regular course of operation of its business, which offers if accepted would constitute sales at arm's length. Whether the offers are bona fide shall be determined on the basis of the facts in each case, such as sales actually made, the nature of the advertising, sales literature, and other means used to effectuate sales. It is not necessary that the offers for sale be made to the same class of purchasers as those to whom the article is being leased.

(c)To qualify as the “same type and model of article”, the article offered for sale must be an unused article essentially the same in size, design, and function as the article being leased. Slight differences in appearance or accessories will not render articles dissimilar which are identical in all other respects.

(d)&#x2014;(1)In case of a lease of an article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, tax shall be paid on each lease payment in an amount computed by applying to such lease payment a percentage equal to the rate of tax in effect on the date of the lease payment. Such tax payments shall continue to be made under such lease, or any subsequent lease of the article, until the cumulative total of the tax payments equals the total tax. Lease payments made thereafter with respect to that article shall not be subject to tax. For definition of the term “total tax,” see paragraph (e) of this section.

(2)If the rate of tax is increased or decreased during a lease period, the new rate shall apply to the lease payments made on and after the date of the change, but the amount of the total tax shall remain the same.

(e)For purposes of this section, the term “total tax” means the amount of tax, computed at the rate in effect on the date of the first lease of the article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, which would be due on the constructive sale price of the article as determined under section 4216(b) of the Code and § 53.95, as if the article had been sold by a manufacturer at retail on such date.

(f)If the lessor sells the article before the total tax has become payable, the tax payable on the sale shall be the lesser of the following amounts:

(1) The difference between:

(i) The total tax, and

(ii) The aggregate tax applicable to lease payments already received; or

(2) A tax computed, at the rate in effect on the date of the sale, on the price for which the article is sold. For purposes of (f)(2) of this section, the provisions of section 4216(b) of the Code for determining a constructive sale price shall not apply if the sale is at arm's length. If the sale is not at arm's length, the tax referred to in (f)(2) of this section shall be computed on a constructive sale price as provided in § 53.95.

(g)If the lessor sells an article after the total tax has become payable, the tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code shall not apply to such sale.

##### Subpart K - Exemptions, Registration, Etc.

###### § 53.131 Tax-free sales; general rule.

(a)Section 4221(a) of the Code sets forth the following exempt purposes for which an article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax-free by the manufacturer, producer, or importer:

(1) For use by the purchaser for further manufacture, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for use by such second purchaser in further manufacture,

(2) For export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export,

(3) For use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft,

(4) To a State or local government for the exclusive use of a State or local government, and

(5) To a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code, if an article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code is sold free of tax by the manufacturer of the article for an exempt purpose referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the manufacturer shall be relieved of any tax liability under chapter 32 of the Code with respect to such sale if the manufacturer in good faith accepts a proper certification by the purchaser that the article or articles will be used by the purchaser in the stated exempt manner. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a list of the exempt purposes referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code.

(2)The following are situations wherein section 4221(c) of the Code is applicable with respect to sales made tax free on the assumption that one of the following sections of the Code provides exemption for such sales:

(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for further manufacture by a first purchaser (see § 53.132),

(ii) Section 4221(a)(3) of the Code, relating to supplies for vessels and aircraft (see § 53.134),

(iii) Section 4221(a)(4) of the Code, relating to sales to State or local governments (see § 53.135),

(iv) Section 4221(a)(5) of the Code, relating to sales to nonprofit educational organizations (see § 53.136).

(3)The relief from liability for the payment of tax provided by section 4221(c) of the Code is not applicable with respect to sales made tax free on the assumption that one of the following sections of the Code provides exemption for such sales:

(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for resale to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture (see § 53.132),

(ii) Section 4221(a)(2) of the Code, relating to sales for export (see § 53.133).

(4)If the manufacturer at the time of its sale has reason to believe that the article sold by it is not intended for the exempt purpose indicated by the purchaser, or that the purchaser has failed to register as required, the manufacturer is not considered to have accepted certification from the purchaser in good faith, and is not relieved from liability under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code.

(5)A manufacturer selling articles free of tax under this section shall indicate to the purchaser that:

(i) Certain articles normally subject to tax are being sold tax free, and

(ii) The purchaser is obtaining those articles tax free for an exempt purpose under an exemption certificate or its equivalent.

(6) The manufacturer may transmit this information by any convenient means, such as coding of sales invoices, provided that the information is presented with sufficient particularity so that the purchaser is informed that he has obtained the articles tax free and:

(i) The purchaser can compute and remit the tax due if an article sold tax free for further manufacture is diverted to a taxable use,

(ii) The manufacturer can remit the tax due with respect to an article purchased tax free for resale for use in further manufacture or for export if, within the 6-month period described in § 53.132(c) or § 53.133(c), the manufacturer does not receive proof that the article has been exported or resold for use in further manufacturer, or

(iii) The purchaser can notify the manufacturer if an article otherwise purchased tax free is diverted to a taxable use.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Every purchaser who is required to be registered (see § 53.140) shall furnish to the seller, as evidence in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchaser, the exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased and the registration number of the purchaser. Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale.

(2)For the evidence which purchasers not required to register must furnish to the seller in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchasers, see paragraph (b) of § 53.133 for sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, paragraph (d) of § 53.134 for sales of supplies to vessels or aircraft, paragraph (c) of § 53.135 for sales to State and local governments, and paragraph (c) of § 53.141 for sales and purchases by the United States.

###### § 53.132 Tax-free sale of articles to be used for, or resold for, further manufacture.

(a)&#x2014;(1)Under prescribed conditions, an article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, for use by the purchaser in further manufacture, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture. See section 4221(d) (6) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture. See section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.180 for the circumstances under which credit or refund is available when tax-paid articles are used in further manufacture.

(2)See section 4221(b)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section for provisions under which the exemption provided in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code shall cease to apply in the case of an article sold by the manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser for use in further manufacture unless the manufacturer receives timely proof of resale for further manufacture.

(b)(1) For purposes of the exemption from the manufacturers excise tax provided by section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, an article shall be treated as sold for use in further manufacture if the article is sold for use by the purchaser as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code;

(2) An article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component of, another article if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article when the other article is sold by the manufacturer. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacture of another article if it is consumed in whole or in part in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges that are used by the manufacturer of firearms to test new firearms. However, an article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of, or as a component part of, another article.

(c)&#x2014;(1)The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code and described in paragraph (a) of this section in respect of an article sold by the manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of such article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless, within such 6-month period, the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that the article was actually resold by the purchaser to a second purchaser for such use. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, such proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold. If the manufacturer later obtains such proof, it may file a claim for refund or credit of this tax. The payment of this tax by the manufacturer is not considered an overpayment by the subsequent manufacturer or producer for which the subsequent manufacturer or producer is entitled to a credit or refund under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code. See section 4221(d)(6) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture.

(2)&#x2014;(i)The proof of resale to be received by the manufacturer, as required under section 4221(b)(1) of the Code, may consist of either a copy of the invoice of the manufacturer's vendee directed to his purchaser which discloses the certificate of registry number held by each party or a statement described in this paragraph. In the case of an invoice of manufacturer's vendee, it must appear from such invoice (or by statement attached thereto) that the article was in fact resold for use in further manufacture. In lieu of such an invoice, proof of resale may consist of a statement, executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee which includes the following:

(A) Date statement was executed.

(B) Name and address of manufacturer's vendee (if other than the person executing statement).

(C) Certificate of registry number held by vendee.

(D) Specify article(s) purchased tax-free, by whom purchased, certificate of registry number of second purchaser, date of purchase(s), whether articles were purchased as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part or parts of, an article or articles taxable under Chapter 32 of the Code.

(E) Statement that person executing statement or manufacturer's vendee possesses proof of tax-free resale of the article(s) in the form of purchase orders and sales invoices and identifying the person who will maintain custody of such proof for 3 years from the date of the statement and will make such proof available for inspection by TTB during such 3 year period.

(F) Statement that a previous statement has not been executed in respect of such certificate of resale and that the person signing the statement is aware that fraudulent use of the statement may subject the person signing the statement and all parties making fraudulent use of the statement to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.

(G) Name, signature, and title of individual executing statement.

(ii)Any statement executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one or more articles purchased tax free from a manufacturer and resold for use in further manufacture within the 6-month period prescribed in section 4221(a)(1) of the Code and paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Such statement (or other prescribed proof of resale) must be retained for inspection by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in section 6001 of the Code.

(iii)A preprinted statement, TTB I 5600.37, Statement of Manufacturer's Vendee, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed statement. Extra copies of TTB I 5600.37 may be reproduced as needed.

###### § 53.133 Tax-free sale of articles for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export.

(a)(1) An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. See § 53.11 for the meaning of the term “exportation”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of this section only if the person to whom the manufacturer sells the article intends either to export the article or to resell it to a person who intends to export it. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of this section by a manufacturer to a purchaser for resale to a second purchaser which does not intend to export the article itself but plans to resell it to a third purchaser for export. See section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code and § 53.177 for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are exported from the United States.

(2) If an article, otherwise taxable under chapter 32 of the Code:

(i) Is sold tax free by the manufacturer pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, and

(ii) Is returned subsequently to the United States in an unused and undamaged condition,

(b)In the case of sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, if the first or the second purchaser is located in a foreign country or possession of the United States, such purchaser is not required to register as provided in section 4222(a) of the Code and § 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain from such purchaser at the time title to the article passes or at the time of shipment, whichever is earlier, either:

(1) A written order or contract of sale showing that the manufacturer is to ship the article to a foreign destination; or

(2) Where delivery by the manufacturer is to be made within the United States, a statement from the purchaser showing:

(i) That the article is purchased either to fill existing or future orders for delivery to a foreign destination or for resale to another person engaged in the business of exporting who will export the article, and

(ii) That such article will be transported to its foreign destination in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to any resale except for export. See section 4221(b) of the Code and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for requirements as to timely proof of exportation and cessation of the exemption for export unless the evidence to show actual exportation has been received by the manufacturer.

(c)The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and paragraph (a) of this section for an article sold by the manufacturer for export or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of the article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless within the 6-month period the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section, that the article was actually exported. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, the proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold.

(d)(1) Exportation may be evidenced by:

(i) A copy of the export bill of lading issued by the delivering carrier,

(ii) A certificate by the agent or representative of the export carrier showing actual exportation of the article,

(iii) A certificate of landing signed by a customs officer of the foreign country to which the article is exported,

(iv) Where the foreign country has no customs administration, a statement of the foreign consignee showing receipt of the article, or

(v) Where a department or agency of the United States Government is unable to furnish any one of the foregoing four types of proof of exportation, a statement or certification on the department or agency stationery, executed by an authorized officer, that the listed or identified articles have, in fact, been exported.

(2) In any case where the manufacturer is not the exporter, the manufacturer must have in its possession a statement from the vendee to whom the manufacturer sold the article stating the following:

(i) Date statement was executed.

(ii) Name and address of manufacturer's vendee (if other than the person executing statement).

(iii) Certificate of registry number held by vendee.

(iv) Specify article(s) purchased tax-free, by whom purchased, and date of purchase.

(v) Statement that article(s) was either exported in due course by the vendee or was sold to another person who in due course exported the article(s).

(vi) Name and address of vendee who will maintain possession of the proof of exportation documents, description of the documents, and statement that vendee will maintain documents for 3 years and make them available to TTB for inspection.

(vii) Statement that a previous statement has not been executed in respect of the articles covered by this statement and that fraudulent use of this statement may subject person executing statement and all parties making fraudulent use of statement to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.

(viii) Name, signature, title, and address of individual executing certificate.

(3) The statement executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, may be executed with respect to any one or more articles purchased tax free from a manufacturer and exported within the 6-month period prescribed in section 4221(b)(2) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section. Such statement shall be kept for inspection by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in section 6001 of the Code.

(4)A preprinted statement, TTB I 5600.36, Statement of Manufacturer's Vendee, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed statement. Extra copies of TTB I 5600.36 may be reproduced as needed.

###### § 53.134 Tax-free sale of articles for use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft.

(a)&#x2014;(1)An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(3) of the Code and this section, for use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “supplies for vessels or aircraft.” An article may be sold tax free under the provisions of this section only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to the owner, officer, charterer, or authorized agent of a vessel or aircraft for use as supplies for the vessel or aircraft. No sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(B) of the Code and paragraph (c) of § 53.178 for circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are used, or sold for use, as supplies for vessels or aircraft. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of this section by the manufacturer to passengers or members of the crew of a vessel or aircraft.

(2)In the case of any article sold by the manufacturer for use by the purchaser as supplies for civil aircraft of foreign registry employed in foreign trade or in trade between the United States and any of its possessions, the provisions of this paragraph apply only if the reciprocity requirements of section 4221(e)(1) of the Code are met.

###### § 53.135 Tax-free sale of articles to State and local governments for their exclusive use.

(a)An article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(4) of the code and this section, to a State or local government for the exclusive use of such State or local government. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “State or local government”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale is made directly to a State or local government for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a State or local government for its exclusive use, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. A sale of an article to a State or local government for resale is not considered to be a sale for the “exclusive use” of the State or local government, within the meaning of section 4221(a)(4) of the Code, and, therefore, such sales may not be made tax free. Such sales are not exempt regardless of whether the resales are made to government employees, or the fact that the article is an item of equipment the employee is required to possess in carrying out his duties. For example, pistols or revolvers may not be sold tax free to a State or local government for resale to its police officers. See section 6416(b)(2)(C) of the Code, and paragraph (d) of § 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a State or local government.

(b)The termincludes any State, the District of Columbia, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing.section 7871(a)(2)(B) of the Code and 26 CFR 305.7701&#x2013;1which provide that an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State for purposes of exemption from an excise tax imposed by chapter 32. Section 7871(b) of the Code provides that the exemption from tax applies only if the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal government.

(c)(1) In the case of a State or local government which is registered (see § 53.141 for provisions under which a State or local government may register if it so desires), the provisions of paragraph (c) of § 53.131 have application as to the evidence required in support of tax-free sales. If a State or local government is not registered, the evidence required in support of a tax-free sale to the State or local government shall, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by an officer or employee authorized by the State or local government to execute and sign the certificate. If it is impracticable to furnish a separate certificate for each order or contract because of frequency of purchases, a certificate covering all orders between given dates (such period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters) will be acceptable. The certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be retained by the manufacturer as provided in § 53.24(d). A certificate of exemption to support tax-free sales under this section must contain the following:

(i) Title of official executing certificate, branch of government, date executed, and statement that official is authorized to execute certificate.

(ii) List articles covered by the certificate or beginning and ending dates during which orders will be placed by the purchaser (period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters).

(iii) Name of manufacturer from which articles purchased.

(iv) Governmental unit purchasing articles.

(v) Statement that is understood that articles purchased under this certificate of exemption are limited to use exclusively by the purchasing governmental entity.

(vi) Statement that is understood that any fraudulent use of this certificate may subject the person executing the certificate and all parties making fraudulent use of the certificate to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.

(vii) Name, address, and signature of person executing the certificate.

(2) A purchase order, provided that all of the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is included therein, is acceptable in lieu of a separate exemption certificate.

(3)A preprinted certificate, TTB I 5600.35, Exemption Certificate, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed certificate. Extra copies of TTB I 5600.35 may be reproduced as needed.

(d)If articles purchased tax free for the exclusive use of a State or local government (whether on the basis of a registration number or an exemption certificate) are, prior to use by the State or local government, resold under circumstances that do not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government (such as pistols or revolvers that are resold by a police department to its police officers), the parties responsible in the State or local government are required to inform the manufacturer, producer, or importer from whom the articles were purchased that they were disposed of in a manner that did not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government. A willful failure to supply the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the information required by this subparagraph will subject responsible parties to the penalties provided by section 7203 of the Code.

###### § 53.136 Tax-free sales of articles to nonprofit educational organizations.

(a)An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(5) of the Code and this section, to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “nonprofit educational organization”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code, and paragraph (e) of § 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a nonprofit educational organization.

(b)The term “nonprofit educational organization” means an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code. Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) describes an “educational organization” as one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code, provided the primary function of such school is the presentation of formal instruction and provided such school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.

(c)Every nonprofit educational organization purchasing tax free under section 4221(a)(5) of the Code must furnish the following information to the seller:

(1) The tax exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased, and

(2) Its registration number. Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale “except that a single notification containing the information described in this paragraph may cover all sales by the seller to the purchaser made during a designated period not to exceed 12 successive calendar quarters.”. See paragraph (c) of § 53.131 for the evidence required to establish exemption.

###### §§ 53.137-53.139 [Reserved]

###### § 53.140 Registration.

(a)Except as provided in § 53.141, tax-free sales under section 4221 of the Code may be made only if the manufacturer, first purchaser, and second purchaser, as the case may be, have registered as required by this section. To secure a Certificate of Registry, the applicant must furnish the information required in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b)Except as provided in § 53.141, any person who is eligible to sell or purchase articles free of a tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code and who has not registered with the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service prior to January 1, 1991 or with TTB in accordance with the provisions of this section shall, prior to making a tax-free sale or purchase, file TTB Form 5300.28, in duplicate, executed in accordance with the instructions contained on the reverse of TTB Form 5300.28. The person who receives an approved Certificate of Registry shall be considered to be registered for purposes of selling or purchasing articles tax free as provided in this section. In the case of a nonprofit educational organization, information shall be furnished showing that the organization is an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code, or is a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a).

(c)See § 53.131(c)(1) for evidence required in support of tax-free sales to purchasers who are required to be registered.

(d)If either the seller or purchaser is not registered as required by this section of the regulations, tax-free sales may not be made, except as indicated in § 53.141.

(e)(1) For exceptions to the requirement for registration, see section 4222(b) of the Code and § 53.141.

(2) For revocation or suspension of registration, see § 53.142.

###### § 53.141 Exceptions to the requirement for registration.

(a)(1) A State or local government purchasing articles direct from the manufacturer for its exclusive use may, but is not required to, register as provided in § 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free to a State or local government that is not registered, the manufacturer must obtain from an authorized official of the State or local government and retain in the manufacturer's possession either a properly executed exemption certificate, or a purchase order that contains the same information required to be furnished in an exemption certificate. See § 53.135(c) for the information necessary to substantiate a tax-free sale under such circumstances.

(2) Each State requesting registration will be assigned one Certificate of Registry. The registration number shown on this certificate may be used by all agencies, boards, and commissions of the State that are authorized by the State to make purchases for the exclusive use of the State. However, the registration number assigned to a State may not be used by any political subdivision of that State, such as a county or municipality. Each political subdivision of a State desiring to obtain a Certificate of Registry must obtain a separate registration number.

(b)Persons whose principal place of business is not within the United States may, but are not required to, register in order to purchase articles tax free for export. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain the evidence required by § 53.133(b).

(c)The registration requirements of the regulations in this part do not apply to purchases and sales by the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The evidence required in support of such tax-free purchases and sales is a notation on the purchase order or other document furnished to the seller clearly indicating that the article or articles are being purchased tax free as authorized by chapter 32 of the Code.

(d)An article subject to an excise tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of § 53.134 for use by the purchaser as supplies for a vessel or aircraft if both the manufacturer and the purchaser are registered under the provisions of § 53.140. The article also may be sold tax free for such use even though neither the manufacturer nor the purchaser is so registered if the provisions of paragraph (d) of § 53.134 are satisfied.

###### § 53.142 Denial, revocation or suspension of registration.

(a) The appropriate TTB officer is authorized to deny, revoke or temporarily suspend, upon written notice, the registration of any person and the right of such person to sell or purchase articles tax free under section 4221 of the Code in any case in which he finds that:

(1) The registrant is not a bona fide manufacturer, or a purchaser reselling direct to manufacturers or exporters;

(2) The registrant is for some other reason not eligible under these regulations to retain a Certificate of Registry; or

(3) The registrant has used his registration to avoid payment of the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code, or to postpone or interfere in any manner with the collection of such tax;

(4) Such denial, revocation, or suspension is necessary to protect the revenue; or

(5) The registrant failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of § 53.140, relating to the evidence required to support a tax-free sale.

(b) The denial, revocation, or suspension of registration is in addition to any other penalty that may apply under the law for any act or failure to act.

###### § 53.143 Special rules relating to further manufacture.

(a)For purposes of Chapter 32 of the Code, a manufacturer or producer to whom an article is sold or resold tax free under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by it in further manufacture shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of such article. If a manufacturer who purchases an article tax free for further manufacture does not use the article for further manufacture, the sale of the article by it, or its use of the article other than in further manufacture, shall, for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 32 of the Code, be treated as a sale or use of the article by the manufacturer thereof. See paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for determination of taxable sale price where an article purchased tax free for further manufacture is resold, or used other than in further manufacture.

(b)Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the tax liability referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be based on the price for which the article was sold by the purchasing manufacturer, or, where the manufacturer uses the article for a purpose other than that for which it was purchased, the tax shall be based on the price at which such or similar articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof. See section 4218(e) of the Code and § 53.115.

(c)(1) Instead of computing the tax as described under paragraph (b) of this section, the purchasing manufacturer who has incurred liability for tax on its sale or use of an article as provided by paragraph (a) of this section may compute the tax incurred under chapter 32 of the Code by using as the tax base either the price for which the article was sold to it by the first purchaser, if any, or the price for which such article was sold by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article. The purchasing manufacturer must have in its possession information upon which to substantiate such basis for tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the price for which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer or by the first purchaser shall be determined as provided in section 4216 of the Code and §§ 53.91&#x2013;53.102. However, such price shall not be adjusted for any discount, rebate, allowance, return, or repossession of a container or covering, or otherwise.

(2) The election under this paragraph shall be in the form of a statement attached to the return reporting the tax applicable to the sale or use of the article which gave rise to such tax liability. Such election, once made, may not be revoked.

##### Subpart L - Refunds and Other Administrative Provisions of Special Application to Manufacturers Taxes

###### § 53.151 Returns.

(a)(1) Liability for tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code shall be reported on TTB Form 5300.26, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Return. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, a return on Form 5300.26 shall be filed for a period of one calendar quarter.

(2)For return periods after September 30, 1992, every person required to make a return on TTB Form 5300.26 who does not incur any firearms and ammunition excise tax liability in a given calendar quarter shall not be required to file a return on TTB Form 5300.26 for that calendar quarter. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, every person required to make a return on TTB Form 5300.26 who does not incur any firearms and ammunition excise tax liability for the entire calendar year and who has not filed a final return in accordance with § 53.152 shall file an annual return on TTB Form 5300.26.

(3)For return periods prior to October 1, 1992, every person required to make a return on TTB Form 5300.26 shall make a return for each calendar quarter (whether or not liability was incurred for any tax reportable on the return for the return period) until the person has filed a final return in accordance with § 53.152.

(4)Each return required under the regulations in this part, together with any prescribed copies, records, or supporting data, shall be completed in accordance with the applicable forms, instructions, and regulations.

(5)One-time or occasional filers are not required to file quarterly or annual returns pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the person reporting tax does not engage in any activity with respect to which tax is reportable on the return in the course of a trade or business. Such persons shall file and pay tax for periods only when liability is incurred. See § 53.159(b)(2), providing that a deposit of taxes is not required for a one-time or occasional filing.

(b)&#x2014;(1)If the appropriate TTB officer determines that any taxpayer who is required to deposit taxes under the provision of §§ 53.157 or 53.159 has failed to make deposits of those taxes, the taxpayer shall be required, if so notified in writing by the appropriate TTB officer, to file a monthly or semimonthly return on TTB Form 5300.26. Every person so notified by the appropriate TTB officer shall file a return for the calendar month or semimonthly period in which the notice is received and for each calendar month or semimonthly period thereafter until the person has filed a final return in accordance with § 53.152 or is required to file returns on the basis of a different return period pursuant to notification as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2)The appropriate TTB officer may require the taxpayer, by notice in writing, to file a quarterly or monthly return, if the taxpayer has been filing returns for a semimonthly period, or may require the taxpayer to file a quarterly or semimonthly return, if the taxpayer has been filing monthly returns.

(3)(i) If a taxpayer who has been filing quarterly returns receives notice to file a monthly or semimonthly return, or a taxpayer who has been filing monthly returns receives notice to file a semimonthly return, the first return required pursuant to the notice shall be filed for the month or semimonthly period in which the notice is received and all months or semimonthly periods which are not includable in an earlier period for which the taxpayer is required to file a return.

(ii) If a taxpayer who has been filing monthly or semimonthly returns receives notice to file a quarterly return, the last month or semimonthly period for which a return shall be filed is the last month or semimonthly period of the calendar quarter in which the notice is received.

(iii) If a taxpayer who has been filing semimonthly returns receives notice to file a monthly return, the last semimonthly period for which a return shall be made is the last semimonthly period of the month in which the notice is received.

###### § 53.152 Final returns.

(a)Any person who is required to make a return on TTB Form 5300.26 pursuant to § 53.151 and who in any return period ceases operations in respect of which the person is required to make a return on the form, shall make the return for that return period as a final return. A return made as a final return shall be marked “Final Return” by the person filing the return. A taxpayer who has only temporarily ceased to incur liability for tax required to be reported on TTB Form 5300.26 because of temporary or seasonal suspension of business or for other reasons, shall not make a final return until such operations are permanently ceased.

(b)Each final return shall have attached a statement showing the address at which the records required by the regulations in this part will be kept, the name of the person keeping the records, and, if the business of the taxpayer has been sold or otherwise transferred to another person, the name and address of that person and the date on which the sale or transfer took place. If no sale or transfer occurred or if the taxpayer does not know the name of the person to whom the business was sold or transferred, that fact should be included in the statement.

###### § 53.153 Time for filing returns.

(a)Each return required to be made under § 53.151(a) for a return period of one calendar quarter shall be filed on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the close of the period for which it is made. However, a return may be filed on or before the 10th day of the second calendar month following the close of the period if timely deposits under section 6302(c) of the Code and § 53.157 have been made in full payment of the taxes due for the period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a deposit which is not required by regulations in respect of the return period may be made on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the close of the period.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Each return required to be made under § 53.151(b) for a monthly period shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the month following the close of the period for which it is made.

(2)Each return required to be made under § 53.151(b) for a semimonthly period shall be filed not later than the 10th day of the semimonthly period following the close of the period for which it is made.

(3)Each return filed under the provisions of § 53.151(a) for a return period of one calendar year shall be filed not later than the 31st day following the close of the calendar year.

(c)If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance shall be due on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, “legal holiday” is defined by section 7503 of the Code and 26 CFR 301.7503(b).

(d)The taxpayer is subject to a penalty for failure to file a return or to pay tax within the prescribed time as imposed by section 6651 of the Code, if the return and remittance are not filed before the close of business on the prescribed last day of filing. For additions to the tax in the case of failure to file a return within the prescribed time, see 27 CFR 70.96.

###### § 53.154 Manner of filing returns.

(a) Each return on TTB Form 5300.26 shall be filed with TTB, in accordance with the instructions on the form.

(b) When the taxpayer sends the return on TTB Form 5300.26 by U.S. Mail, the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return was mailed shall be considered the date of delivery of the return. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the taxpayer. When the taxpayer sends the return with or without remittance by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the return and, if accompanied, of the remittance.

###### § 53.155 Extension of time for filing returns.

(a)Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted for filing any return statement or other document required with respect to the taxes impose by chapter 32, because the information required for the filing of those documents is under normal circumstances readily available. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control, a taxpayer believes an extension of time for filing is justified, the taxpayer may apply to the appropriate TTB officer for an extension. An extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. For extensions of time for payment of the tax, see § 53.156.

(b)The application for an extension of time for filing the return shall be addressed to the appropriate TTB officer with whom the return is to be filed and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay. It should be made on or before the due date of the return, and failure to do so many indicate negligence and constitute sufficient cause for denial. It should, where possible, be made sufficiently early to permit consideration of the matter and reply before what otherwise would be the due date of the return.

(c)If an extension of time for filing the return is granted, a return shall be filed before the expiration of the period of extension.

###### § 53.156 Extension of time for paying tax shown on return.

(a)(1) Ordinarily, no extensions of time will be granted for payment of any tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code, and shown or required to be shown on any return. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control a taxpayer believes an extension of time for payment is justified, the taxpayer may apply for an extension filing TTB Form 5600.38. The period of an extension shall not be in excess of 6 months from the date fixed for payment of the tax, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period of the extension may be in excess of 6 months.

(2) The granting of an extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for the payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. See § 53.155.

(b)An extension of the time for payment shall be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired will result in an undue hardship. The extension will not be granted upon a general statement of hardship. The term “undue hardship” means more than an inconvenience to the taxpayer. It must appear that substantial financial loss, for example, loss due to the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result to the taxpayer from making payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. If a market exists, the sale of property at the current market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an undue hardship.

(c)An application for an extension of time for payment of the tax shown or required to be shown on any return shall be made on TTB Form 5600.38, Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax, and shall be accompanied by evidence showing the undue hardship that would result to the taxpayer if the extension were refused. The application shall also be accompanied by a statement of the assets and liabilities of the taxpayer and an itemized statement showing all receipts and disbursements for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the due date of the amount to which the application relates. The application, with supporting documents, must be filed on or before the date prescribed for payment of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. The application will be examined, and within 30 days, if possible, will be denied, granted, or tentatively granted subject to certain conditions of which the taxpayer will be notified. If an additional extension is desired, the request for it must be made on or before the expiration of the period for which the prior extension is granted.

(d)If an extension of time for payment is granted, the payment shall be made on or before the expiration of the period of the extension without the necessity of notice and demand. The granting of an extension of time for payment of the tax does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of interest on the tax during the period of the extension. See section 6601 of the Code and 26 CFR 301.6601&#x2013;1.

###### § 53.157 Deposit requirement for deposits made for calendar quarters prior to July 1, 1995.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if for any calendar month (other than the last month of a calendar quarter) any person required to file a quarterly excise tax return on TTB Form 5300.26 has a total liability under this part of more than $100 for all excise taxes reportable on that form, the amount of liability for taxes shall be deposited by the person in accordance with the instructions on TTB Form 5300.27 on or before the last day of the month following the calendar month.

(b)(1) If any person required to file an excise tax return on TTB Form 5300.26 for any calendar quarter has a total liability under this part of more than $2,000 for all excise taxes reportable on that form for any calendar month in the preceding calendar quarter, the amount of that liability for taxes under this part for any semimonthly period (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) in the succeeding calendar quarter shall be deposited by the person in accordance with the instructions on TTB Form 5300.27 on or before the depositary date (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) applicable to the semimonthly period.

(2) A person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a semimonthly period if&#x2014;

(i)(A) The person's deposit for the semimonthly period is not less than 90 percent of the total amount of the excise taxes reportable by the person on TTB Form 5300.26 for the period, and

(B) If the semimonthly period occurs in a calendar month other than the last month in a calendar quarter, the person deposits any underpayment for the month by the 9th day of the second month following the calendar month; or

(ii)(A) The person's deposit for each semimonthly period in the calendar month is not less than 45 percent of the total amount of the excise taxes reportable by the person on TTB Form 5300.26 for the month, and

(B) If such month is other than the last month in a calendar quarter, the person deposits any underpayment for such month by the 9th day of the second month following the calendar month; or

(B) If such month is other than the last month in a calendar quarter, the person deposits any underpayment for such month by the 9th day of the second month following the calendar month; or

(iv)(A) The requirements of paragraph (b)(2) (i)(A), (ii)(A), or (iii)(A) of this section are satisfied for the first semimonthly period of a calendar month after December 1990,

(B) If the person's deposit for the second semimonthly period of the calendar month is, when added to the deposit for the first semimonthly period, not less than 90 percent of the total amount of the excise taxes reportable by the person on TTB Form 5300.26 for the calendar month, and

(C) If the semimonthly periods occur in a calendar month other than the last month in a calendar quarter, the person deposits any underpayment for the month by the 9th day of the second month following the calendar month.

(3)(i) Paragraph (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall not apply to any person who normally incurs in the first semimonthly period in each calendar month more than 75 percent of the person's total excise tax liability under this part for the month.

(ii) Persons who make their deposits in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section will find it unnecessary to keep their books and records on a semimonthly basis.

(c)Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if any person required to file an excise tax return on TTB Form 5300.26 for any calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 1990, has a total liability under this part for all excise taxes reportable on the form for the calendar quarter which exceeds by more than $100 the total amount of taxes deposited by the person pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section for the calendar quarter, the person shall, on or before the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter for which the return is required to be filed, deposit in accordance with the instructions on TTB Form 5300.27 the full amount by which the person's liability for all excise taxes reportable on the return for that calendar quarter exceeds the amount of excise taxes previously deposited by the person for that calendar quarter.

(d)&#x2014;(1)The termmeans the first 15 days of a calendar month or the portion of a calendar month following the 15th day of that month.

(2)The termmeans, in the case of deposits for semimonthly periods beginning after December 31, 1990, the 9th day of the semimonthly period following the semimonthly period for which the taxes are reportable.

(3)The termmeans the financial institution designated as a depository for the payment of excise taxes on TTB Form 5300.27, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form.

(e)&#x2014;(1)Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited for periods beginning after December 31, 1990 shall be accompanied by an TTB Form 5300.27, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form, or TTB Form 5300.26, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Return, which shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable instructions. Taxpayers electing to remit deposits by EFT pursuant to § 53.158 shall prepare and submit TTB Form 5300.26 or TTB Form 5300.27 in accordance with the instructions on the form. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date it is received (or is deemed received under section 7502(e) and 26 CFR 301.7502&#x2013;1) by the lockbox financial institution, or the TTB officer designated on TTB Form 5300.27 or TTB Form 5300.26 accompanying the deposit, or when made by electronic fund transfer, the Treasury Account. Amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered to be paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the returns), or at the time deposited, whichever is later.

(2)A person required by this section to make deposits may make one or more remittances with respect to the amount required to be deposited. An amount of tax which is not otherwise required by this section to be deposited may, nevertheless, be deposited if the person liable for the tax so desires.

(3)Each person making deposits pursuant to this section shall report on the return for the period with respect to which the deposits are made information regarding the deposits in accordance with the instructions applicable to the return and pay (or deposits by the due date of the return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for the period.

(4)Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form will be furnished, so far as possible, to persons required to make deposits under this section. Such a person will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished. A person not supplied with the form is required to apply for it in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed, supplying with the application the person's name, employer identification number, address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate. Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form are available as provided in § 53.21(b).

(f)This section does not apply to taxes for:

(1) Any month or semimonthly period in which the taxpayer receives notice pursuant to § 53.151(b) to file TTB Form 5300.26 or

(2) Any subsequent month or semimonthly period for which a return on TTB Form 5300.26 is required.

###### § 53.158 Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

(a)For return periods after September 30, 1992, any taxpayer liable for firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part may elect to remit payments and deposits of the taxes (taxpayments) by electronic fund transfer (EFT). A taxpayer who elects to make remittance by EFT must use that method of remitting excise taxes on firearms and ammunition for a minimum of four consecutive calendar quarters. A taxpayer who makes remittance by EFT for a calendar quarter may not use any other method of remitting and ammunition excise taxes for that quarter.

(b)(1) On or before the 10th day of the calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the taxpayer will begin remitting taxes by EFT, each taxpayer who elects to make remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating that remittances will be paid by EFT. Taxpayers who gave written notification in a previous calendar quarter electing to make remittances of tax by EFT are not required to give additional written notifications to continue remitting tax by EFT for succeeding calendar quarters.

(2) For each deposit made or return filed in accordance with this subpart, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's financial institution to make an EFT in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account no later than the close of business on the last day for making the deposit or filing the return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.153. The request will take into account any time limit established by the financial institution.

(3) Taxpayers who elect to discontinue making remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes may make such election at any time following four consecutive calendar quarters in which tax is remitted by EFT. Taxpayers electing to discontinue making remittances by EFT shall remit the tax with the next deposit or return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.151 for remittances not made by EFT and notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax deposit form or return stating that remittance of firearms and ammunition excise taxes will no longer be made by EFT.

(c)(1) Taxpayers who elect to make firearms and ammunition excise taxpayments by EFT shall file the deposit form and/or return with TTB in accordance with the applicable instructions on the forms.

(2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by EFT is received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.

(3) When the taxpayer directs the financial institution to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment and will be retained as part of the required records.

(d)The taxpayer is subject to penalties imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6651 and 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a payment or deposit of tax by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for making such payment or deposit.

(e)Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer an TTB Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer follows when preparing deposits, returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this subpart.

###### § 53.159 Deposit requirement for deposits made for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 1995.

(a)&#x2014;(1)For purposes of this section, the term “tax liability” means the total tax liability for the specified period plus or minus any allowable adjustments made in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form on which the return is made.

(2)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the term “semimonthly period” means the first 15 days of a calendar month or the remaining portion of a calendar month following the 15th day of that month.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), and (j) of this section, any person required to file a quarterly excise tax return on TTB Form 5300.26 must make a deposit of tax for each semimonthly period as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(6) of this section, the deposit of tax for each semimonthly period must be equal to the amount of tax liability incurred during that semimonthly period. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, no deposit is required for any semimonthly period in which no tax liability is incurred.

(2)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, any person who has a tax liability for the current calendar quarter of $2,000 or less is not required to make deposits for that quarter. However, semimonthly deposits of tax are required beginning with the semimonthly period in which unpaid tax liability exceeds $2,000 and for every semimonthly period thereafter in which tax liability is incurred. The first deposit for the current quarter shall be equal to the unpaid tax liability; thereafter, deposits shall be equal to the amount of tax liability incurred during that semimonthly period.

(3);Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, any person who made a return of tax on TTB Form 5300.26 reporting taxes for the second preceding calendar quarter (the “look-back quarter”), or who did not file a return for the look-back quarter because of the provisions of § 53.151(a)(2), is considered to have complied with the requirement for deposit of taxes for the current calendar quarter if&#x2014;

(i) The deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the current calendar quarter is an amount equal to not less than(16.67 percent) of the total tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter;

(ii) Each deposit is made on time; and

(iii) The amount of any underpayment of taxes for the current calendar quarter is paid by the due date of the return.

(4)The safe harbor rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply for the third calendar quarter unless&#x2014;

(i) The deposit of taxes for the semimonthly period July 1&#x2013;September 15 meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

(ii) Each deposit of taxes for the periods September 16&#x2013;25 and September 26&#x2013;30 is not less than 1/12th (8.34 percent) of the total tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter.

(5)&#x2014;(i)The safe harbor rule as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) is modified for the first and second calendar quarters beginning on or after the effective date of an increase in the rate of any tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 4181 to which this part 53 applies.

(ii)The amount of deposit for calendar quarters referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be adjusted so that the deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is not less than(16.67 percent) of the tax liability the person would have had with respect to the tax for the look-back quarter if the increased rate of tax had been in effect for that look-back quarter.

(6)Any person who did not file a return of tax on TTB Form 5300.26 for the first and second preceding calendar quarters because they were not engaged in any activity with respect to which tax is reportable on the return in the course of a trade or business, is considered to have complied with the requirement for deposit of taxes for the current calendar quarter if&#x2014;

(i) The deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is not less than 95 percent of the tax liability incurred with respect to those taxes during the semimonthly period;

(ii) Each deposit is made on time; and

(iii) The amount of any underpayment of taxes for the current calendar quarter is paid by the due date of the return.

(d)(1) If a person fails to make deposits as required under this part, the appropriate TTB officer may withdraw the person's right to use the safe harbor rule provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(2)The appropriate TTB officer may also require a taxpayer who fails to make deposits of tax to file a monthly or semimonthly return, see § 53.151(b)(1).

(e)Except for deposits for the period September 16&#x2013;25, each deposit required to be made by this section shall be made not later than the 9th day of the semimonthly period following the close of the period for which it is made. The deposit for the period September 16&#x2013;25 shall be made not later than September 28. The deposit for the period September 26&#x2013;30, is due not later than October 9.

(f)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if the due date of the deposit falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deposit and remittance shall be due on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, “legal holiday” is defined by section 7503 of the Code and 27 CFR 70.306(b) of this chapter.

(2) If the required due date of the deposit for the period September 16&#x2013;25 falls on a Saturday, the deposit and remittance shall be due on the preceding day. If such required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance shall be due on the following day.

(g)Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited shall be accompanied by Form 5300.27, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form, or Form 5300.26, Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Return, which shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable instructions. Taxpayers electing to remit deposits by EFT pursuant to § 53.158 shall prepare and submit Form 5300.26 or Form 5300.27 in accordance with the instructions contained in Procedure 92&#x2013;1, Publication 5000.11. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date it is received by the lockbox financial institution, or the TTB officer designated on the form accompanying the deposit, or the Treasury Account, when made by EFT. In order for deposits of less than $20,000 made by U.S. Mail to be considered received timely, the date of mailing must be on or before the second day preceding the due date of the deposit as evidenced by the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the deposit was mailed. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the taxpayer. When the taxpayer sends the deposit by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the deposit. Any deposit of $20,000 or more must be received by the last day prescribed for making such deposit, regardless of when mailed. Amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered to be paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the returns), or at the time deposited, whichever is later.

(h)A person required by this section to make deposits shall make one deposit for a semimonthly period.

(i)Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form will be furnished, so far as possible, to persons required to make deposits under this section. Such a person will not be excused from making a deposit however, by the fact that no form has been furnished. A person not supplied with the form is required to obtain the form in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. Copies of the Federal Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax Deposit form are available as provided in § 53.21(b).

(j)This section does not apply to taxes for:

(1) Any month or semimonthly period in which the taxpayer receives notice pursuant to section 53.151(b) to file TTB Form 5300.26; or

(2) Any subsequent month or semimonthly period for which a return on TTB Form 5300.26 is required.

(3) Taxpayers required to file monthly returns shall make semimonthly deposits of 100 percent of the liability incurred during each semimonthly period by the 9th day of the month following the last day of the semimonthly period. Taxpayers required to file semimonthly returns shall pay any tax due for the semimonthly period with each return.

For regulations under section 6404 of the Code of general application in respect of abatements of assessments to tax, see 27 CFR 70.125 (Procedure and Administration).

###### §§ 53.163-53.170 [Reserved]

###### § 53.171 Claims for credit or refund of overpayments of manufacturers taxes.

Any claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of a tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart and the applicable provisions of 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration). A claim on TTB Form 2635 (5620.8) is not required in the case of a claim for credit, but the amount of the credit shall be claimed by entering that amount as a credit on a return of tax under this subpart filed by the person making the claim. In this regard, see § 53.185.

###### § 53.172 Credit or refund of manufacturers tax under chapter 32.

(a)&#x2014;(1)This paragraph applies only to claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of manufacturers tax imposed by Chapter 32. It does not apply, however, to a claim for credit or refund on any overpayment described in paragraph (b) of this section which arises by reason of the application of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code.

(2)No credit or refund of any overpayment to which this paragraph (a) applies shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a written consent of the ultimate purchaser to the allowance of the credit or refund, or submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, asserting that:

(i) The person has neither included the tax in the price of the article with respect to which it was imposed nor collected the amount of the tax from a vendee, and identifying the nature of the evidence available to establish these facts, or

(ii) The person has repaid the amount of the tax to the ultimate purchaser of the article.

(3)&#x2014;(i)The term “ultimate purchaser”, as used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, means the person who purchased the article for consumption, or for use in the manufacture of other articles and not for resale in the form in which purchased.

(ii)&#x2014;(A)If tax under chapter 32 of the Code is paid in respect of an article and the appropriate TTB officer determines that the article is not subject to tax under chapter 32, the term “ultimate purchaser”, as used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, includes any wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer who, on the 15th day after the date of the determination holds for sale any such article with respect to which tax has been paid, if the claim for credit or refund of the overpayment in respect of the articles held for sale by wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer is filed on or before the date on which the person who paid the tax is required to file a return for the period ending with the first calendar quarter which begins more than 60 days after the date of the determination by the appropriate TTB officer.

(B)A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax in respect of an article as to which a wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer is the ultimate purchaser, as provided in this paragraph (a)(3)(ii), must be supported by a statement that the person filing the claim has a statement, by each wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer whose articles are covered by the claim, showing total inventory, by model number and quantity, of all such articles purchased tax-paid and held for sale as of 12:01 a.m. of the 15th day after the date of the determination by the appropriate TTB officer that the article is not subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code.

(C)The inventory shall not include any such article, title to which, or possession of which, has previously been transferred to any person for purposes of consumption unless the entire purchase price was repaid to the person or credited to the person's account and the sale was rescinded or any such article purchased by the wholesaler, jobber, distributor, or retailer as a component part of, or on or in connection with, another article. An article in transit at the first moment of the 15th day after the date of the determination is regarded as being held by the person to whom it was shipped, except that if title to the article does not pass until delivered to the person the article is deemed to be held by the shipper.

(b)&#x2014;(1)This paragraph applies only to claims for credit or refund of amounts paid as tax under chapter 32 of the Code that are determined to be overpayments by reason of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code (relating to tax payments in respect of certain uses, sales, or resales of a taxable article).

(2)No credit or refund of an overpayment to which this paragraph (b) applies shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, asserting that:

(i) The person neither included the tax in the price of the article with respect to which it was imposed nor collected the amount of the tax from a vendee, and identifying the nature of the evidence available to establish these facts, or

(ii) The person repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the tax to the ultimate vendor of the article, or

(iii) The person has secured, and will submit upon request of the appropriate TTB officer, the written consent of the ultimate vendor to the allowance of the credit or refund.

(3)The termas used in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, means the seller making the sale which gives rise to the overpayment or which last precedes the exportation or use which has given rise to the overpayment.

(c)This section does not apply to any overpayment determined under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code (relating to price readjustments), section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code (relating to certain cases in which refund or credit is allowable to the manufacturer who uses, in the further manufacture of a second article, a taxable article purchased by the manufacturer taxpaid), or section 6416(b)(5) of the Code (relating to the return to the seller of certain installment accounts which the seller had previously sold). In this regard, see §§ 53.173, 53.180, and 53.183.

###### § 53.173 Price readjustments causing overpayments of manufacturers tax.

In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of a price readjustment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.174 or § 53.175, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. Price readjustments may not be anticipated. However, if the readjustment has actually been made before the return is filed for the period in which the sale was made, the tax to be reported in respect of the sale may, at the election of the taxpayer, be based either:

(a) On the price as so readjusted, or

(b) On the original sale price and a credit or refund claimed in respect of the price readjustment.

###### § 53.174 Determination of price readjustments.

(a)&#x2014;(1)&#x2014;(i)If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code has been paid and thereafter the price of the article on which the tax was based is readjusted, that part of the tax which is proportionate to the part of the price which is repaid or credited to the purchaser is considered to be an overpayment. A readjustment of price to the purchaser may occur by reason of:

(A) The return of the article,

(B) The repossession of the article,

(C) The return or repossession of the covering or container of the article, or

(D) A bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance against the price at which the article was sold.

(ii)A price readjustment will not be deemed to have been made unless the person who paid the tax either:

(A) Repays part or all of the purchase price in cash to the vendee,

(B) Credits the vendee's account for part or all of the purchase price, or

(C) Directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee.

(iii)The credit or refund allowable by reason of a price readjustment in respect of the sale of a taxable article may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax originally due and payable on the article as the amount of the tax-included readjustment bears to the original tax-included sale price of the article.

(2)&#x2014;(i)If, in the case of a taxable sale, the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code is based on a constructive sale price determined under any paragraph of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94&#x2013;53.97, as determined without reference to section 4218 of the Code, then any price readjustment made with respect to the sale may be taken into account under this section only to the extent that the price readjustment reduces the actual sale price of the article below the constructive sale price.

(ii)If a manufacturer (within the meaning of section 4223(a) of the Code) to whom an article is sold or resold free of tax in accordance with the provisions of section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use in further manufacture diverts the article to a taxable use or sells it in a taxable sale, and pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code computes the tax liability in respect of the use or sale on the price for which the article was sold to the manufacturer or on the price at which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer, a reduction of the price on which the tax was based does not result in an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code of this section. Moreover, if a manufacturer purchases an article tax free and computes the tax in respect of a subsequent sale of the article pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code, an overpayment does not arise by reason of readjustment of the price for which the article was sold by the manufacturer except where the readjustment results from the return or repossession of the article by the manufacturer, and all of the purchase price is refunded by the manufacturer. See, however, paragraph (b)(4) of this section as to repurchased articles.

(b)&#x2014;(1)If a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment results:

(i) If the article is returned before use, and all of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or

(ii) If the article is returned under an express or implied warranty as to quality or service, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or

(iii) If title is still in the seller, as, for example, in the case of certain installment sales contracts, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account.

(2)For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if all of the purchase price of an article has been returned to the vendee, except for an amount retained by the manufacturer pursuant to contract as reimbursement of expense incurred in connection with the sale (such as a handling or restocking charge), all of the purchase price is considered to have been returned to the vendee.

(3)If, under any of the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and all of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, the sale is considered to have been rescinded. Any subsequent sale or use of the article by the manufacturer will be considered to be an original sale or use of the article by the manufacturer which is subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code unless otherwise exempt. If under any such condition an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and only part of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, a subsequent sale of the article by the manufacturer will be subject to tax to the extent that the sale price exceeds the adjusted sale price of the first taxable sale.

(4)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a price readjustment will not result when a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax on the sale of the article, even though all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, since such a transaction will be considered to be a repurchase of the article by the manufacturer.

(c)If a taxable article is repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. However, if the manufacturer later resells the repossessed article for a price in excess of the original adjusted sale price, the manufacturer will be liable for tax under chapter 32 of the Code to the extent that the resale price exceeds the original adjusted sale price.

(d)If the covering or container of a taxable article is returned to, or repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a portion of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account by reason of the return or repossession of the covering or container, a price adjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. If a taxable article is considered to have been repurchased, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the covering or container accompanies the taxable article as part of the transaction, the covering or container will also be considered to have been repurchased.

(e)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided in § 53.175 (relating to readjustments in respect of local advertising), the basic consideration in determining, for purposes of this section, whether a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance has been made is whether the price actually by, or charged against, the purchaser has in fact been reduced by subsequent transactions between the parties. Generally, the price will be considered to have been readjusted by reason of a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance, only if the manufacturer who made the taxable sale repays a part of the purchase price in cash to the vendee, or credits the vendee's account, or directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee, in consideration of factors which, if taken into account at the time of the original transaction, would have resulted at that time in a lower sale price. For example, a price readjustment will be considered to have been made when a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance is given in consideration of such factors as prompt payment, quantity buying over a specified period, the vendee's inventory of an article when new models are introduced, or a general price reduction affecting articles held in stock by the vendee as of a certain date. On the other hand, repayments made to the vendee do not effectuate price readjustments if given in consideration of circumstances under which the vendee has incurred, or is required to incur, an expense which, if treated as a separate item in the original transaction, would have been incudable in the price of the article for purposes of computing the tax.

The provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

(2)A charge-off of an amount outstanding in an open account, due to inability to collect, is not a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance and does not, in and of itself, give rise to a price readjustment within the meaning of this section.

(3)If title to an article has passed to the vendee, the subsequent loss, damage, or destruction of the article while in the possession of a carrier for delivery to the vendee does not, in and of itself, affect the price at which the article was sold. However, if the article was sold under a contract providing that, if the article was lost, damaged, or destroyed in transit, title would revert to the vendor and the vendor would reimburse the vendee in full for the sale price, then the original sale is considered to have been rescinded. The vendor is entitled to credit or refund of the tax paid upon reimbursement of the full tax-included sale price to the vendee.

###### § 53.175 Readjustment for local advertising charges.

(a)If a manufacturer has paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the price of any article sold by the manufacturer and thereafter has repaid a portion of the price to the purchaser or any subsequent vendee in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising of the article or any other article sold by the manufacturer which is taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, the reimbursement will be considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made. The term “local advertising,” as used in this section, has the same meaning as prescribed by section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and includes generally, advertising which is broadcast over a radio station or television station, or appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.

(b)&#x2014;(1)If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code was paid with respect to local advertising charges that were excluded in computing the taxable price of an article sold in any calendar year but are not repaid to the manufacturer's purchaser or any subsequent vendee before May 1 of the following calendar year, the subsequent repayment of those charges by the manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising will be considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made.

(2)If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code was paid with respect to local advertising charges that were excluded in computing the taxable price of an article sold in any calendar year but are not repaid to the manufacturer's purchaser or any subsequent vendor before May 1 of the following calendar year, the manufacturer may make a redetermination, in respect of the calendar year in which the charge was made, of the price readjustments constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. This redetermination may be made by excluding the local advertising charges made in the calendar year that became taxable as of May 1 of the following calendar year.

###### § 53.176 Supporting evidence required in case of price readjustments.

No credit or refund of an overpayment arising by reason of a price readjustment described in § 53.174 or § 53.175 shall be allowed unless the manufacturer who paid the tax submits a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:

(a) Describing the circumstances which gave rise to the price readjustment,

(b) Identifying the article in respect of which the price readjustment was allowed,

(c) Showing the price at which the article was sold, the amount of tax paid in respect of the article, and the date on which the tax was paid,

(d) Giving the name and address of the purchaser to whom the article was sold, and

(e) Showing the amount repaid to the purchaser or credited to the purchaser's account.

###### § 53.177 Certain exportations, uses, sales, or resales causing overpayments of tax.

In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of certain exportations, uses, sales, or resales described in section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or, in the case of overpayments under chapter 32 of the Code, may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. However, under the circumstances described in section 6416(c) of the Code and § 53.184, the overpayments under chapter 32 may be refunded to an exporter or shipper. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and 53.179. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.

###### § 53.178 Exportations, uses, sales, and resales included.

(a)The payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, will be considered to be an overpayment by reason of any exportation, use, sale, or resale described in any one of paragraphs (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section. This section applies only in those cases where the exportation, use, sale, or resale (or any combination thereof) referred to in any one or more of these paragraphs occurs before any other use. If any article is sold or resold for a use described in any one of these paragraphs and is not in fact so used, the paragraph is treated in all respects as inapplicable.

(b)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code if the article is by any person exported to a foreign country or shipped to a possession of the United States. It is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph, whether the person who made the taxable sale had knowledge at the time of the sale that the article was being purchased for export to a foreign country or shipment to a possession of the United States. See § 53.184 for the circumstances under which a claim for refund by reason of the exportation of an article may be claimed by the exporter or shipper, rather than by the person who paid the tax. For definition of the term “possession of the United States”, see § 53.11.

(c)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(B) of the Code if the article is used by any person, or is sold by any person for use by the purchaser, as supplies for vessels or aircraft. The term “supplies for vessels or aircraft”, as used in this paragraph, has the same meaning as when used in sections 4221(a)(3), 4221(d)(3), and 4221(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder (§ 53.134(b)(1)).

(d)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(C) of the Code if the article is sold by any person to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia for the exclusive use of a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. For provisions relating to tax-free sales to a State, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, see section 4221(a)(4) of the Code and § 53.131.

(e)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(2)(D) of the Code if the article is sold by any person to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. The term “nonprofit educational organization”, as used in this paragraph (e), has the same meaning as when used in section 4221 (a)(5) or (d)(5) of the Code, whichever applies, and the regulations under § 53.136.

###### § 53.179 Supporting evidence required in case of manufacturers tax involving exportations, uses, sales, or resales.

(a)No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178, of tax under chapter 32 of the Code shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim the evidence required by § 53.172(b)(2) and a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:

(1) Showing the amount claimed in respect of each category of exportations, uses, sales, or resales on which the claim is based and which give rise to a right of credit or refund under section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.177,

(2) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,

(3) Showing the amount of tax paid in respect of the article or articles and the dates of payment, and

(4) Indicating that the person claiming a credit or refund possesses evidence (as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that the article has been exported, or has been used, sold, or resold in a manner or for a purpose which gives rise to an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.178.

(b)&#x2014;(1)&#x2014;(i)The evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax, as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, must, in the case of an article exported, consist of proof of exportation in the form prescribed in § 53.133 or must, in the case of other articles sold tax-paid by that person, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article, in the form prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, if the article to which the claim relates has passed through a chain of sales from the person who paid the tax to the ultimate purchaser, the evidence required to be retained by the person who paid the tax may consist of a certificate, executed and signed by the ultimate vendor of the article, in the form provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, rather than the proof of exportation itself or the certificate of the ultimate purchaser.

(ii)(A) The certificate executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the article to which the claim relates must identify the article, both as to nature and quantity; show the address of the ultimate purchaser of the article, and the name and address of the ultimate vendor of the article; and describe the use actually made of the article in sufficient detail to establish that credit or refund is due, except that the use to be made of the article must be described in lieu of actual use if the claim is made by reason of the sale or resale of an article for a specified use which gives rise to the overpayment.

(B) If the certificate sets forth the use to be made of any article, rather than its actual use, it must show that the ultimate purchaser has agreed to notify the claimant if the article is not in fact used as specified in the certificate.

(C) The certificate must also contain a statement that the ultimate purchaser understands that the ultimate purchaser and any other party may, for fraudulent use of the certificate, be subject to all applicable criminal penalties under the Internal Revenue Code.

(D) A purchase order will be acceptable in lieu of a separate certificate of the ultimate purchaser if it contains all the information required by this paragraph.

(iii)Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person who paid the tax as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section may be executed with respect to any one or more overpayments by the person which arose under section 6416(b)(2) and § 53.178 by reason of exportations, uses, sales or resales, occurring within any period of not more than 12 consecutive calendar quarters, the beginning and ending dates of which are specified in the certificate. A certificate supporting a claim for credit or refund under this section shall contain the following:

(A) Name of ultimate vendor if other than person executing the certificate.

(B) Statement that article(s) was purchased by the ultimate vendor tax-paid and was thereafter exported, used, sold, or resold.

(C) Description of proof which supports exportation or certificate as to use executed by ultimate purchaser.

(D) Statement that ultimate vendor retains such proof for 3 years from the date of the statement and will, upon request, supply such proof at any time within such 3 year period to the taxpayer to establish that credit or refund is due in respect of the article.

(E) Statement that to the best knowledge and belief of the person executing the certificate, no statement in respect of the proof of exportation or certificate has previously been executed and that the person executing the certificate understands that any fraudulent use of the certificate may subject the person executing the certificate or any other party to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.

(F) Name, title, address and signature of person executing certificate and date signed.

(G) Description of all articles covered by the certificate, with the corresponding vendor's invoice number, date of resale of article, quantity, whether articles were exported or used and the use made of article or to be made of article.

(iv)TTB I 5600.33, Statement of Ultimate Vendor, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed certificate. Additional copies may be reproduced as needed.

(2)If the person claiming credit or refund or an overpayment to which this section applies has repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the overpayment to the ultimate vendor or if the ultimate vendor consents to the allowance of the credit or refund, a statement to that effect, signed by the ultimate vendor, must be shown on, or made a part of, the supporting evidence required under this section to be retained by the person claiming the credit or refund. In this regard, see § 53.172(b)(2).

###### § 53.180 Tax-paid articles used for further manufacture and causing overpayments of tax.

In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.181 by reason of the sale of an article, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer who uses the article in further manufacture of a second article or who sells the article with, or as a part of, the second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer, the subsequent manufacturer may file claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart subsequently filed. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund, see 27 CFR § 70.123 (Procedure and Administration), 53.172 and 53.182. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.

###### § 53.181 Further manufacture included.

(a)The payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article by a manufacturer of the article will be considered to be an overpayment by reason of any use in further manufacture, or sale as part of a second manufactured article, described in paragraph (b) of this section. This section applies in those cases where the exportation, use, or sale (or any combination of those activities) referred to in this paragraph occurs before any other use.

(b)A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code if the article is used by the subsequent manufacturer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer which is taxable under chapter 32 of the Code. For this purpose it is immaterial whether the second article is sold or otherwise disposed of, or if sold, whether the sale is a taxable sale. Any article to which this paragraph applies which would have been used in the manufacture or production of a second article, except for the fact that it was broken or rendered useless in the process of manufacturing or producing the second article, will be considered to have been used as a component part of the second article.

###### § 53.182 Supporting evidence required in case of tax-paid articles used for further manufacture.

(a)No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.181 shall be allowed unless the subsequent manufacturer submits with the claim the evidence required by § 53.132 and a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence:

(1) Showing the amount claimed in respect of each category of exportations, uses, or sales on which the claim is based and which give rise to a right of credit or refund under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.180,

(2) Showing the name and address of the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,

(3) Identifying the article, both as to nature and quantity, in respect of which credit or refund is claimed,

(4) Showing the amount of tax paid in respect of the article by the manufacturer or producer of the article and the date of payment.

(5) Indicating that the article was used by the claimant as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer or was sold on or in connection with, or with the sale of, a second article manufactured or produced by the manufacturer, and

(6) Identifying the second article, both as to nature and quantity.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The certificate executed and signed by the ultimate purchaser of the second article must contain the same information as that required in § 53.179(b)(1)(ii), except that the information must be furnished in respect of the second article, rather than the article to which the claim relates.

(2)Any certificate executed and signed by an ultimate vendor as evidence to be retained by the person claiming credit or refund must be executed in the same form and manner as that provided in § 53.179(b)(2)(iii).

(3)If the person claiming credit or refund of an overpayment to which this section applies has repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the overpayment to the ultimate vendor or if the ultimate vendor consents to the allowance of the credit or refund, a statement to that effect, signed by the ultimate vendor, must be shown on, or made a part of, the evidence required to be retained by the person claiming the credit or refund. In this regard, see § 53.172(b)(2).

###### § 53.183 Return of installment accounts causing overpayments of tax.

(a)In the case of any payment of tax under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code in respect of the sale of any installment account that is determined to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section upon return of the installment account, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which that person subsequently files. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund under this section, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration) and paragraph (c) of this section. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.

(b)The payment of tax imposed by section 4216(d)(1) of the Code on the sale of an installment account by the manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code to the extent of the tax allocable to any consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser of the installment account upon the return of the account to the manufacturer pursuant to the agreement under which the account originally was sold, if the readjustment of the consideration occurs pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The tax allocable to the repaid or credited consideration is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code with respect to the installment account as the amount of consideration repaid or credited to the purchaser bears to the total consideration for which the account was sold. This paragraph (b) does not apply where an installment account is originally sold pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

(c)No claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, within the meaning of section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section, of tax under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, indicating:

(1) The name and address of the person to whom the installment account was sold,

(2) The amount of tax due under section 4216(d)(1) of the Code by reason of the sale of the installment account, the amount of the tax paid under section 4216(d)(1) with respect to the sale, and the date of payment,

(3) The amount for which the installment account was sold,

(4) The amount which was repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account by reason of the return of the account to the person claiming the credit or refund, and

(5)(i) The fact that the amount repaid or credited to the purchaser of the account was so repaid or credited pursuant to the agreement under which the account was sold, and

(ii) The fact that the account was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to that agreement.

###### § 53.184 Refund to exporter or shipper.

(a)Any payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code and §§ 53.178 and 53.179, by reason of the exportation of any article may be refunded to the exporter or shipper of the article pursuant to section 6416(c) of the Code, if:

(1) The exporter or shipper files a claim for refund of the overpayment, and

(2) The person who paid the tax waives the right to claim credit or refund of the tax.

(b)No claim for refund of any overpayment of tax to which this section applies shall be allowed unless the exporter or shipper submits with that claim proof of exportation in the form prescribed by § 53.133, and a statement, signed by the person who paid the tax, showing:

(1) That the person who paid the tax waives the right to claim credit or refund of the tax, and

(2) The amount of tax paid on the sale of the article and the date of payment.

###### § 53.185 Credit on returns.

Any person entitled to claim refund of any overpayment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code may, in lieu of claiming refund of the overpayment, claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart subsequently filed. Any such credit claimed on a return must be supported by the evidence prescribed in the applicable regulations in this subpart and 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration).

###### § 53.186 Accounting procedures for like articles.

(a)In applying section 6416 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, a person who has purchased like articles from various manufacturers may determine the particular manufacturer from whom that person purchased any one of those articles by a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, by a last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or by any other consistent method approved by the appropriate TTB officer. For the first year for which a person makes a determination under this section, the person may adopt any one of the following methods without securing prior approval by the appropriate TTB officer.

(1) FIFO method.

(2) LIFO method.

(3) Any method by which the actual manufacturer of the article is in fact identified.

(4) Any other method of determining the manufacturer of a particular article must be approved by the appropriate TTB officer before its adoption. After any method for identifying the manufacturer has been properly adopted, it may not be changed without first securing the consent of the appropriate TTB officer.

(b)In applying section 6416 and §§ 53.171&#x2013;53.186, if the identity of the manufacturer of any article has been determined by a person pursuant to a method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, that manufacturer of the article must determine the tax paid under Chapter 32 of the Code with respect to that article consistently with the method used in identifying the manufacturer.

###### § 53.187 OMB control numbers.

(a)This section collects and displays the control numbers assigned to collections of information in this part by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. TTB intends that this section comply with the requirements of §§ 1320.12, 1320.13, and 1320.14 of 5 CFR part 1320 (OMB regulations implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act), for the display of control numbers assigned by OMB to collections of information in the regulations in this part.

###### § 70.701 Rules and regulations.

(a)(1) Alcohol, tobacco, and firearms rules take various forms. The most important rules are issued as Treasury decisions, prescribed by the Administrator, and approved by the Secretary. Other rules may be issued over the signature of the Administrator or the signature of any appropriate TTB officer. The channeling of rules varies with the circumstances. Treasury decisions are prepared within the appropriate TTB offices. After approval by the Administrator, Treasury decisions are forwarded to the Secretary for further consideration and final approval.

(2) Where required by 5 U.S.C. 553, the Administrator publishes in thegeneral notice of proposed rules unless all persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. Notice may also be published in thein such other instances as may be desirable. This notice includes (i) a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rulemaking proceedings; (ii) reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and (iii) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. Interested persons may participate in the rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons may also submit requests for a public hearing. However, the Bureau reserves the right to determine, in the light of all circumstances, whether a public hearing should be held.

(3) If the Bureau determines that the public good will be served thereby, it may hold a public hearing for discussion of the issues raised by the proposed regulations. Such a hearing is announced by a notice in thestating the time and place where the hearing is to be held. The following rules govern the conduct of the public hearing only if incorporated by reference in the notice announcing the hearing:

(i) A person wishing to make oral comments at a public hearing shall submit, within the time prescribed in the notice of hearing, an outline of the topics he wishes to discuss, and the time he wishes to devote to each topic. Ordinarily, a period of 10 minutes is the time allotted to each person for making his oral comments.

(ii) A person making oral comments should be prepared to answer questions not only on the topics listed in his outline but also on matters relating to any written comments which he has submitted.

(iii) At the conclusion of the presentation of comments of persons listed in the agenda, to the extent time permits, other comments will be received.

(iv) Written comments submitted prior to the hearing shall be available at the hearing for inspection. Any request for copies of such written comments is treated as a request for records under 27 CFR 70.802(g).

(v) To the extent resources permit, the public hearings to which this paragraph applies may be transcribed.

(vi) In unusual circumstances or for good cause shown, the application of rules contained in this paragraph may be waived.

(b)Interested persons may submit data, views, or arguments with respect to a notice of proposed rulemaking published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553. Procedures are provided in § 70.802(g) for members of the public to inspect and obtain copies of written comments submitted in response to proposed rules. All such comments are open in their entirety to public inspection. Therefore, the Bureau does not recognize any designation of material in comments as confidential or not to be disclosed, and any material that the commenter considers to be confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the public should not be included in his comments. The name of any person submitting comments or requesting a public hearing, the issues which may be discussed at the hearing, and outlines relating to the hearing are open to public disclosure. (See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for rules relating to hearing outlines.)

(c)Interested persons may petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. A petition for the issuance of a rule shall identify the section or sections of law involved; and a petition for the amendment or repeal of a rule shall set forth the section or sections of the regulations involved. The petition shall set forth the reasons for the requested action. Such petitions shall be given careful consideration, and the petitioner shall be advised of the action taken thereon. Petitions must be addressed to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Washington, DC 20220. A petition to establish a new American viticultural area or to modify an existing American viticultural area is subject to the rules in part 9 of this chapter.

(d)&#x2014;(1)All Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations and amendments thereto are published as Treasury Decisions which appear in thethe Code of Federal Regulations, and the quarterly Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) Bulletin. The TTB Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Bureau for announcing Treasury decisions, legislation, administrative matters, and other items of general interest. The Bulletin incorporates, into one publication, all matters of the Bureau which are of public record. It is the policy of the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of all laws administered by the Bureau as well as rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin (including those published prior to July 1, 1972, in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, regulations appearing in internal management documents and statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of the public are published. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Department of the Treasury Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered. Concerned parties are cautioned against reaching the same conclusion in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is published quarterly and may be obtained, on a subscription basis, from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

(2)(i)(A) A “TTB Ruling” is an official interpretation by the Bureau that has been published in the Bulletin for the information and guidance of taxpayers, Bureau officers, and others concerned. TTB Rulings represent the conclusions of the Bureau on the application of the law to the entire state of facts involved. In those that are based on positions taken in rulings to industry members or technical advice to Bureau field offices, identifying details and confidential information are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements concerning disclosure of information obtained from the public.

(B) A “TTB Procedure” is a statement of procedure that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or other members of the public under law and regulations administered by the Bureau or information that, although not necessarily affecting the rights and duties of the public, should be a matter of public knowledge. TTB Procedures establish methods for performing operations in compliance with the requirements of law and regulations. It is Bureau practice to publish as much of the internal management document or communication as is necessary for an understanding of the procedure. TTB Procedures may also be based on internal management documents which should be a matter of public knowledge even though not necessarily affecting the rights or duties of the public.

(ii) It is the policy of the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all rulings and other communications to members of the public or to Bureau field offices involving substantive law, procedures affecting taxpayer's rights or duties, or industry regulations, except those involving:

(A) Issues specifically and clearly covered by statute or regulations;

(B) Issues specifically covered by rulings, procedures, opinions, or court decisions previously published in the Bulletin;

(C) Issues not likely to arise again because of unique or specific facts;

(D) Determinations of fact rather than interpretations of law;

(E) Acceptability under the law and regulations of containers, labels, and advertising involving alcoholic beverages;

(F) Tobacco operations, such as the disposition of abandoned, seized, or condemned tobacco products;

(G) Informers and informers' rewards; or

(H) Disclosure of secret formulas, processes, business practices, and other similar information.

(iii)(A) It is the practice of the Bureau to publish as much of the ruling or communication as is necessary for an understanding of the position stated. However, in order to prevent unwarranted invasions of personal privacy and to comply with statutory provisions, such as 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 26 U.S.C 6103 and 7213, dealing with disclosure of information obtained from members of the public, identifying details, including the names and addresses of persons involved, and information of a confidential nature are deleted from the ruling.

(B) TTB Rulings published in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Department of the Treasury Regulations (including amendatory Treasury decisions) but are published to provide precedents to be used in the disposition of other cases, and may be cited and relied upon for that purpose. No unpublished ruling or decision may be relied on, used, or cited by any officer or employee of the Bureau as a precedent in the disposition of other cases.

(C) Concerned persons generally may rely upon TTB Rulings published in the Bulletin in determining the Bureau treatment of their own transactions and need not request specific rulings applying the principles of a published TTB Ruling to the facts of their particular cases. However, since each TTB Ruling represents the conclusion of the Bureau as to the application of the law to the entire state of facts involved, taxpayers, Bureau personnel, and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusion in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. They should consider the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions and TTB Rulings.

(D) Comments and suggestions from taxpayers or other concerned persons on TTB Rulings being prepared for publication in the Bulletin may be solicited, if justified by special circumstances. Conferences on TTB Rulings being prepared for publication will not be granted except where the Bureau determines that such action is justified by special circumstances.

(iv)(A) The appropriate TTB officer is responsible for administering the program for the publication of TTB Rulings and TTB Procedures in the Bulletin including the standards for style and format.

(B) In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, each appropriate TTB officer is responsible for the preparation and appropriate referral for publication of TTB Rulings reflecting interpretations of substantive law made by his office and communicated in writing to members of the public or field offices. In this connection, the Chief Counsel is responsible for the referral to the appropriate TTB officer, for consideration for publication as TTB rulings, of interpretations of substantive law made by his office.

(C) In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the appropriate TTB officers and the Chief Counsel are responsible for determining whether procedures established by an office under their jurisdiction should be published as TTB Procedures and for the initiation, content, and appropriate referral for publication of such TTB Procedures.

###### § 70.702 Forms and instructions.

(a)Tax forms and instructions are developed by the Bureau to explain the requirements of Chapters 32, 51, 52, and 53 of Title 26 of the United States Code or regulations issued thereunder, and are issued for the assistance of taxpayers in exercising their rights and discharging their duties under such laws and regulations. The tax return forms are the instruments through which taxes are collected.

(b)The Bureau provides other necessary or appropriate forms for assisting the public in complying with the technical requirements of the laws and regulations administered by the Bureau. The material contained in the forms and instructions, and the arrangement thereof, is carefully considered and is designed to lead the preparer step-by-step through an orderly accumulation of data to an accurate report of the information required.

(c)Forms prescribed by this part are available as provided in § 70.2(b).

A person requesting copies should allow a reasonable time for processing the request. The provisions of 31 CFR 1.7, relating to fees, apply to requests made in accordance with this paragraph.

###### § 70.803 Requests or demands for disclosure in testimony and in related matters.

(a)The provisions of this section are prescribed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301; section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1280); 12 U.S.C. 3412; 18 U.S.C. 1905; section 2(g) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 202(c)); and sections 5274, 6103, 7213, 7803 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5274, 6103, 7213, 7803 and 7805).

(b)The following definitions apply whenever the defined terms appear in this section.

(1)The termsandmean all officers and employees of the United States, engaged in the administration and enforcement of laws administered by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and appointed or employed by, or subject to the directions, instructions or orders of, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.

(2)The termsandmean any records (including copies thereof) or information, made or obtained by, furnished to, or coming to the knowledge of, any TTB officer or employee while acting in his official capacity, or because of his official status, with respect to the administration of laws administered by or concerning the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

(3)The termmeans any subpoena, notice of deposition either upon oral examination or written interrogatory, or other order, of any court, administrative agency, or other authority.

(c)The disclosure, including the production, of TTB records or information to any person outside the Department of the Treasury or to any court, administrative agency, or other authority, in response to any request or demand for the disclosure of such records or information shall be made only with the prior approval of the appropriate TTB officer. However, nothing in this section restricts the disclosure of TTB records or information for which the appropriate TTB officer has determined that the disclosure is authorized under any provision of statute, Executive order, or regulations, or for which a procedure has been established by the Administrator. For example, this section does not restrict the disclosure of TTB records or information under § 71.22, nor does it restrict the disclosure of TTB records or information which is requested by U.S. attorneys or attorneys of the Department of Justice for use in cases which arise under the laws administered by or concerning the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and which are referred by the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense.

(d)The appropriate TTB officer is hereby authorized to determine whether or not TTB officers and employees will be permitted to disclose TTB records or information in response to:

(1) A request by any court, administrative agency, or other authority, or by any person, for the disclosure of such records or information; or

(2) A demand for the disclosure of such records or information.

(3) The Administrator is also authorized to establish such other procedures as he or she may deem necessary with respect to the disclosure of TTB records or information by TTB officers and employees. Any determination by the appropriate TTB officer as to whether TTB records or information will be disclosed, or any procedure established by the Administrator in connection therewith, must be made in accordance with applicable statutes, Executive orders, regulations, and any instructions that may be issued by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the appropriate TTB officer shall, where either the Secretary or such officer deems it appropriate, refer the opposing of a request or demand for disclosure of TTB records or information to the Secretary.

(e)&#x2014;(1)Any TTB officer or employee who receives a request for TTB records or information, the disposition of which is not covered by a procedure established by the Administrator, must promptly communicate the contents of the request to the appropriate TTB officer. The officer or employee must await instructions from the appropriate TTB officer concerning the response to the request.

(2)Any TTB officer or employee who is served with a demand for TTB records or information, the disposition of which is not covered by a procedure established by the Administrator, must promptly, and without awaiting appearance before the court, administrative agency, or other authority, communicate the contents of the demand to the appropriate TTB officer. The TTB officer or employee must await instructions from the appropriate TTB officer concerning the response to the demand. If it is determined by the appropriate TTB officer that the demand should be opposed, the U.S. attorney, his or her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall be requested to respectfully inform the court, administrative agency, or other authority that the appropriate TTB officer has instructed the TTB officer or employee to refuse to disclose the TTB records or information sought. If instructions have not been received from the appropriate TTB officer at the time when the TTB officer or employee is required to appear before the court, administrative agency, or other authority in response to the demand, the U.S. attorney, his or her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative must be requested to appear with the TTB officer or employee upon whom the demand has been served and request additional time in which to receive such instructions. In the event the court, administrative agency, or other authority rules adversely with respect to the refusal to disclose the records or information pursuant to the instructions of the appropriate TTB officer, or declines to defer a ruling until instructions from the appropriate TTB officer have been received, the TTB officer or employee upon whom the demand has been served must, pursuant to this section, respectfully decline to disclose the TTB records or information sought.

(3)If testimony of an TTB officer or employee is sought by a request or demand on behalf of a party other than a State in any case or matter in which the United States is not a party, an affidavit, or if that is not feasible, a statement shall be submitted. The affidavit or statement shall be prepared by the party (or party's attorney) seeking the testimony, and shall set forth a summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the proceedings. The affidavit or statement must be submitted before permission to testify may be granted. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement of this paragraph.

(4)The request or demand, together with the affidavit or statement (if required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section), must be served at least 5 working days prior to the scheduled date of testimony or disclosure of records, in order to ensure that the appropriate TTB officer has adequate time to consider whether to grant the request or demand. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement of this paragraph.

(5)The appropriate TTB officer must consider whether granting the request or demand would be appropriate under the relevant rules of procedure and substantive law concerning privilege. Among the requests or demands that will not be granted are those that would, if granted, result in&#x2014;

(i) The violation of a statute, such as 26 U.S.C. 6103 or 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule (F.R.Cr.P. Rule 6(e)), or a specific regulation;

(ii) The disclosure of classified information;

(iii) The disclosure of a confidential source or informant, unless the TTB officer or employee and the source or informant, have no objection;

(iv) The disclosure of investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes if enforcement proceedings would thereby be impeded, or of investigative techniques and procedures whose effectiveness would thereby be impaired, unless the appropriate TTB officer determines that the administration of justice requires disclosure;

(v) The disclosure of trade secrets without the owner's consent; or

(vi) Testimony in a case in which TTB has no interest, records or other official information.

(f)The appropriate TTB officer, may, in the interest of Federal and State law enforcement, upon receipt of demands or requests of State authorities, and at the expense of the State, authorize employees under their supervision to attend trials and administrative hearings in liquor, tobacco, firearms, or explosives cases in which the State is a party or on behalf of the State in any criminal case, to produce records, and to testify as to facts coming to their knowledge in their official capacities. However, in cases where a defendant in a criminal case requests or demands testimony or the production of TTB records or information, authorization from the appropriate TTB officer is required. Production or testimony may not divulge information contrary to 26 U.S.C. 6103 and 7213, or 12 U.S.C. 3412. See also 18 U.S.C. 1905.

(g)Any TTB officer or employee who disobeys the provisions of this section will be subject to dismissal and may incur criminal liability.

Save to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as required by law, no administrative law judge shall consult any person or party as to any fact in issue unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. The functions of the administrative law judge shall be entirely separated from the general investigative functions of the agency. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in any proceeding shall, in that or a factually related proceeding, participate or advise in the administrative law judge's or Administrator's decision, or in the agency review on appeal, except as a witness or counsel in the proceedings. The administrative law judge may not informally obtain advice or opinions from the parties or their counsel, or from any officer or employee of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, as to the facts or the weight or interpretation to be given to the evidence. He may, however, informally obtain advice on matters of law from officers or employees who were not engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in that or a factually related proceeding. This limitation does not apply to the Administrator, and the administrative law judge may, at any time, consult with and obtain instructions from him on questions of law and policy.

###### § 71.99 Conduct of hearing.

The administrative law judge is charged with the duty of conducting a fair and impartial hearing and of maintaining order in form and manner consistent with dignity. In the event that counsel or any person or witness in any proceeding shall refuse to obey the orders of the administrative law judge, or be guilty of disorderly or contemptuous language or conduct in connection with any hearing, the administrative law judge may, for good cause stated in the record, suspend the hearing, and, in the case of an attorney, recommend that the Administrator report the matter to the Administrator of Practice for disciplinary action. The refusal of a witness to answer any question which has been ruled to be proper shall be considered by the administrative law judge in determining the weight to be given all the testimony of that witness.

###### § 71.100 Unavailability of administrative law judge.

In the event that the administrative law judge designated to conduct a hearing becomes unavailable before the filing of his findings and decision or recommended decision, the Administrator may assign the case to another administrative law judge for the continuance of the proceeding, in accordance with the regulations in this part in the same manner as if he had been designated administrative law judge at the commencement of the proceeding.

##### Subpart H - Decisions

###### § 71.105 Administrative law judge's finding and decision or recommended decision.

Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as possible, the administrative law judge shall render his decision or recommended decision, as the case may be. All decisions shall become a part of the record and, if proposed findings and conclusions have been filed, shall show the administrative law judge's ruling upon each of such proposed findings and conclusions. Decisions shall consist of (a) a brief statement of the issues of fact involved in the proceeding; (b) the administrative law judge's findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor with record references, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record (including, when appropriate, comment as to the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses); and (c) the administrative law judge's determination or recommended determination on the record. Where the administrative law judge determines that the imposition of a period of suspension of the permit is appropriate, his decision shall state the length of such period of suspension, to commence at such time as the appropriate TTB officer shall specify.

###### § 71.106 Certification and transmittal of record and decision.

After reaching his decision, the administrative law judge shall certify to the complete record of the proceeding before him and (a) in proceedings on an application, shall immediately forward the complete certified record together with four copies of his recommended decision to the appropriate TTB officer for initial decision, or (b) in revocation, suspension or annulment proceedings, shall immediately forward the complete certified record, together with two copies of his decision, to the appropriate TTB officer, serve one copy of his decision on the respondent or his counsel and transmit a copy of his decision to the attorney for the Government.

##### Subpart I - Review

###### § 71.115 Appeal on petition to the Administrator.

An appeal to the Administrator is required prior to application to the Federal courts for review. An appeal may be taken by the applicant or respondent or by the appropriate TTB officer. Such appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for review on appeal with the Administrator within 15 days of the service of the order disapproving an application for a permit or the initial decision suspending, revoking or annulling a permit. The petition must set forth facts tending to show action of an arbitrary nature, or action without reasonable warrant in fact, or action contrary to law and regulations. A copy of the petition shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer or served on the respondent or applicant as the case may be. In the event of such appeal, the appropriate TTB officer shall immediately certify and forward the complete original record, by certified mail, to the Administrator, for his consideration and review.

###### § 71.116 Review by Administrator.

The Administrator, on appeal on petition for review, shall afford a reasonable opportunity for the submission of proposed findings, conclusions or exceptions with reasons in support thereof and an opportunity for oral argument. He may alter or modify any finding of the administrative law judge (or of the appropriate TTB officer in application proceedings) and may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the administrative law judge (or of the appropriate TTB officer in initial application proceedings), or he may remand the case for further hearing, but he shall not consider evidence which is not a part of the record. Appeals and petitions for review shall not be decided by the Administrator in any proceeding in which he has engaged in investigation or prosecution, and in such event he shall so state his disqualification in writing and refer the record to the Under Secretary for appropriate action. The Under Secretary may designate an Assistant Secretary or one of his principal aides to consider any proceeding instead of the Administrator. The original copy of the decision on review shall be placed in the official record of the proceeding, a signed duplicate original shall be served upon the applicant or respondent and a copy shall be transmitted to the appropriate TTB officer. When, on appeal, the Administrator affirms the decision of the appropriate TTB officer or the administrative law judge, as the case may be, disapproving an application or suspending, revoking or annulling a permit, such action shall not supersede the decision of the appropriate TTB officer or the administrative law judge and such decision shall be final.

###### § 71.117 Permit privileges, exceptions.

Pending final determination of any timely appeal in revocation, suspension, or annulment proceeding to the Administrator, the permit involved shall continue in force and effect except that, in the case of industrial use permits, any time after a citation has been issued withdrawals of tax-free spirits or specially denatured spirits by such permittee may, in the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer or Administrator, be restricted to the quantity which, together with the quantity then on hand, is necessary to carry on legitimate operations under such permit. The appropriate TTB officer may, in restricting the permittee to his legitimate needs, refuse to issue any withdrawal permit.

###### § 71.118 Court review.

If an applicant or respondent files an appeal in Federal court of the Administrator's decision, the Administrator, upon notification that an appeal has been taken, shall prepare the record for submission to the court in accordance with the applicable court rules.

###### § 71.119 [Reserved]

##### Subpart J - Miscellaneous

###### § 71.125 Depositions.

The administrative law judge may take or order the taking of depositions by either party to the proceeding at such time and place as he may designate before a person having the power to administer oaths, upon application therefor and notice to the parties to the action. The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition, or under his direction, and the deposition shall be subscribed by the deponent unless subscribing thereof is waived in writing by the parties. Any person may be subpoenaed to appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses at hearings.

Both the application and the subpoena shall set forth the title of the proceedings, the name and address of the person whose attendance is required, the date and place of his attendance and, if documents are to be produced, a description thereof; and the application must have reasonable scope and specify as exactly as possible the documents required, if any, and show their general relevance. Subpoenas shall be served in person. When issued on behalf of the United States, service shall be made by an officer, employee, or agent of the Treasury Department; when issued on behalf of a permittee or applicant, service shall be made by any person who is not a party to the proceeding and is not less than 18 years of age.

###### § 71.127 Witnesses and fees.

Witnesses summoned before the administrative law judge may be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States.

Any destruction under this paragraph shall be in the presence of at least 1 credible witness.

(b) Within 60 days after any destruction made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the owner of the property and any other persons having an interest in the property so destroyed may make application to the Director for reimbursement of the value of the property in accordance with the instructions contained in ATF Publication 1850.1 (9&#x2013;93), Information to Claimants.

##### Subpart D - Remission or Mitigation of Forfeitures

###### § 72.31 Laws applicable.

Remission or mitigation of forfeitures shall be governed by the applicable customs laws.

###### § 72.32 Interest claimed.

Any person claiming an interest in property, including carriers, seized by alcohol, tobacco and firearms officers as subject to administrative forfeiture may file a petition addressed to the Director, for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture of such property.

###### § 72.33 Form of the petition.

There is no set or standardized form provided or required by the Department for use in filing a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture. However, it is preferable that the petition be typewritten on legal size paper; and it is necessary that the petition be executed under oath, prepared in triplicate and addressed to the Director, and that all copies of original documents submitted as exhibits in support of allegations of the petition be certified as true and accurate copies of originals. Each copy of the petition must contain a complete set of exhibits.

###### § 72.34 Contents of the petition.

(a)The petition should contain such a description of the property or carrier and such facts of the seizure as will enable the alcohol, tobacco and firearms officers concerned to identify the property or carrier.

(b)In the event the petition is filed for the restoration of the proceeds derived from sale of the property or carrier pursuant to summary forfeiture, it should also contain, or be supported by, satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or condemnation of forfeiture, and that he was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of the same. (See also § 72.35.)

(c)The petitioner should state in clear and concise terms the nature and amount of the present interest of the petitioner in the property or carrier, and the facts relied upon to show that the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention upon the part of the petitioner to defraud the revenue or to violate the law, or such other mitigating circumstances as, in the opinion of the petitioner, would justify the remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.

(d)If the petitioner is not the one who in person committed the act which caused the seizure the petition should state how the property or carrier came into the possession of such other person, and that the petitioner had no knowledge or reason to believe, if such be the fact, that the property or carrier would be used in violation of law. If known to the petitioner, at the time the petition is filed, that such other person had either a record or a reputation, or both, as a violator in the field of commercial crime, the petition should state whether the petitioner had actual knowledge of such record or reputation, or both, before the petitioner acquired his interest in the property or carrier, before such other person acquired his right in the property or carrier, whichever occurred later. When personal property is seized for violation of the liquor laws, the determining factor will be whether the person dealt with by the petitioner had either a record or a reputation, or both, as a violator of the liquor laws.

(e)The petition should also be accompanied by copies, certified by the petitioner under oath as correct, of contracts, bills of sale, chattel mortgages, reports of investigators or credit reporting agencies, affidavits, and any other papers or documents that would tend to support the claims made in the petition.

(f)The petition should also contain an undertaking to pay the costs, if costs are assessed as a condition of allowance of the petition. Costs shall include all the expenses incurred in seizing and storing the property or carrier; the costs borne or to be borne by the United States; the taxes, if any, payable by the petitioner or imposed in respect of the property or carrier to which the petition relates; the penalty, if any, asserted by the Director; and, if the property or carrier has been sold, or is in the course of being sold, the expenses so incurred.

###### § 72.35 Time of filing petition.

A petition may be filed at any time prior to the sale or other disposition of the property or carrier involved pursuant to administrative forfeiture, but a petition in regard to property or a carrier which has already been sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to administrative forfeiture must be filed within three months from the date of sale, and must contain the proof defined in § 72.34(b). Acquisition for official use is equivalent to sale so far as remission or mitigation of any forfeiture is concerned.

###### § 72.36 Place of filing.

The petition should be filed in triplicate with the Director or his delegate for the region in which the seizure was made.

###### § 72.37 Discontinuance of administrative proceedings.

If the petition is filed prior to administrative sale or retention for official use, proceedings to effect such sale or retention will be discontinued.

###### § 72.38 Return of defective petition.

If the petition is defective in some correctable respect, the original of the petition will be returned by letter to the petitioner for his submission of a corrected petition, in triplicate, within a reasonable time.

###### § 72.39 Final action.

(a)(1) The Director shall take final action on any petition filed pursuant to these regulations. Such final action shall consist either of the allowance or denial of the petition. In the case of allowance, the Director shall state the conditions of the allowance.

(2) In the case of an allowed petition, the Director may order the property or carrier returned to the petitioner, sold for the account of the petitioner, or, pursuant to agreement, acquired for official use.

(3) The Director or his delegate shall notify the petitioner of the allowance or denial of the petition and, in the case of allowance, the terms and conditions under which the Director allowed the petition.

(b)The Director or his delegate shall take final action on any offer in compromise of the liability to forfeiture of personal property, including carriers, seized as provided in § 72.21. Such action shall consist either of the acceptance or rejection of the offer.

###### § 72.40 Acquisition for official use and sale for account of petitioner in allowed petitions.

(a)The property or carrier may be purchased by the United States pursuant to agreement and retained for official use. Where the petitioner is the owner, the purchase price is the appraised value of the property or carrier less all costs. Where the petitioner is a creditor, the purchase price is whichever one of these amounts is the smaller: (1) The petitioner's equity, or (2) the appraised value of the property or carrier less the amount of all costs incident to the seizure and forfeiture.

(b)The petitioner may elect not to comply with the condition on which the property or carrier may be returned. In this event, the Director or his delegate is authorized to sell it. Where the petitioner is the owner of the property or carrier, there is deducted from the proceeds of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and sale, and the Director or his delegate pays to the petitioner, out of the proper appropriation, an amount equal to the balance, if any. Where the petitioner is a creditor, there is deducted from the proceeds of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and sale, and the Director or his delegate pays to the petitioner, out of the proper appropriation, an amount equal to the balance, if any, of the selling price after deduction of all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, or sale:That if the amount of such balance exceeds the amount of the equity of the petitioner, only the latter amount is paid to the petitioner.

###### § 72.41 Re-appraisal of property involved in an allowed petition.

In determining the nature and extent of the relief to be afforded a petitioner pursuant to allowance of his petition, the value of the property or carrier involved in the allowed petition shall be considered to mean the value placed on said property or carrier pursuant to official appraisal thereof immediately following seizure:That if the petitioner desires an up-to-date re-appraisal made of the property or carrier, after notification as to the terms of allowance of the petition, and makes written request therefor, undertaking in said request to pay, or to be liable for, the total costs of such re-appraisal, the property or carrier shall be re-appraised officially in the same manner in which the original appraisal was made, and the terms and conditions of allowance shall stand modified to the extent required by such re-appraisal.

##### Subpart E - Appraiser's Fees

###### § 72.51 Rate of compensation.

Each appraiser selected under § 72.22(a)(2) shall receive compensation at a reasonable fee not to exceed $15.00 per hour or portion thereof for the performance of his or her duties in appraising property seized as subject to forfeiture under Title 26 U.S.C.

##### Subpart F - Administrative Sale or Disposition of Personal Property

The sale shall not occur in less than 10 days from the date of the publication of the notice. At the discretion of the Director or his delegate based upon which method in his sound judgment is most advantageous to the best interests of the United States, the forfeited personal property or carrier may be advertised for sale, and sold, at public auction to the highest bidder on open, competitive bids, or to the highest bidder on sealed, competitive bids.

(b)When a vessel, vehicle, or aircraft seized under 49 U.S.C. App., Chapter 11 is forfeited administratively, the Director may authorize the General Services Administration to conduct the sale pursuant to such conditions as the Director deems proper.

All competitive bids, whether sealed or otherwise, shall be on a unit basis, i.e. if a number of forfeited automobiles are advertised for sale at the same date, hour and place, whether or not in the same notice of sale, there shall be a separate, individual bid required as to each automobile, and it shall not be permissible to accept one blanket bid to cover the entire group of cars offered for sale.

###### § 72.63 Conditions of sale.

(a)All personal property and carriers to be sold shall be offered for sale “as is” and without recourse against the United States.

(b)No guarantee or warranty, expressed or implied, shall be given or understood in respect of any forfeited property or carrier offered for sale.

(c)(1) The United States reserves the right to reject any and all bids received at public auction and in sealed, competitive bid sales.

(3) When “no sale” is declared for cigars, cigarettes, or cigarette papers or tubes, such property shall be destroyed or, if fit for human consumption, be given to a Federal or State hospital or institution.

(d)When only one bid is received for a single unit of property or a carrier offered at public auction or in a sealed, competitive bid sale, such bid shall be considered to be and treated as the highest bid received for that property or carrier.

The terms of sale shall be cash, cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, in the amount of the accepted bid.

###### § 72.65 Sale of forfeited tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes.

All tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes forfeited under the internal revenue laws shall be sold at a price which will include the tax due and payable on those forfeited articles. Written, timely notice shall be given by the Director or his delegate to the manufacturer of any such forfeited articles offered for sale.

At the appointed date, hour, and place of sale, all sealed bids timely filed shall be opened in the presence of all bidders attending the sale, who shall have the privilege of inspecting the bids if they so desire.

###### § 72.69 Alternative disposition of seized carriers.

(a)The Director may discontinue forfeiture proceedings instituted under the Customs laws for seizures of carriers under 49 U.S.C. App., Chapter 11 in favor of the institution of forfeiture proceedings by State or local authorities under an appropriate State or local statute. If such forfeiture proceedings are discontinued or dismissed, the Director may transfer the seized property to the appropriate State or local official, and notice of discontinuance or dismissal shall be provided to all known interested parties.

###### § 73.34 When is an electronically submitted form considered timely filed?

If you submit a form to our electronic document receiving system, the document will be considered filed on the date of the electronic postmark given by that system.

###### § 73.35 Do I need to keep paper copies of forms I submit to TTB electronically?

Nothing in this part alters any other regulatory or statutory requirement that records be maintained in paper format. If the regulations in this chapter require you to keep paper copies of certain forms, you must continue to do so unless TTB otherwise authorizes you to maintain electronic copies of these documents through an approved alternate method or procedure.

##### Subpart D - Electronic Filing of Documents With Other Agencies

#### PART 447 - IMPORTATION OF ARMS, AMMUNITION AND IMPLEMENTS OF WAR

##### Subpart A - Scope

###### § 447.1 General.

The regulations in this part relate to that portion of section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, authorizing the President to designate defense articles and defense services as part of the United States Munitions List (USML) for purposes of import and export controls. To distinguish the list of defense articles and defense services controlled in this part for purposes of permanent import from the list of defense articles and defense services controlled by the Secretary of State for purposes of export and temporary import, this part shall refer to the defense articles and defense services controlled for purposes of permanent import as the U.S. Munitions Import List (USMIL) and shall refer to the export and temporary import control list set out by the Department of State in its International Traffic in Arms Regulations as the USML. Part 447 contains the USMIL and includes procedural and administrative requirements relating to registration of importers, permits, articles in transit, import certification, delivery verification, import restrictions applicable to certain countries, exemptions, U.S. military firearms and ammunition, penalties, seizures, and forfeitures. The President's delegation of permanent import control authorities to the Attorney General provides the Attorney General the authority to assess whether controls are justified, but in designating the defense articles and defense services set out in the USMIL the Attorney General shall be guided by the views of the Secretary of State on matters affecting world peace and the external security and foreign policy of the United States. All designations and changes in designations of defense articles and defense services subject to permanent import control under this part must have the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, with notice given to the Secretary of Commerce.

###### § 447.2 Relation to other laws and regulations.

(a) All of those items on the U.S. Munitions Import List (see § 447.21) which are “firearms” or “ammunition” as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a) are subject to the interstate and foreign commerce controls contained in Chapter 44 of Title 18 U.S.C. and 27 CFR Part 478 and if they are “firearms” within the definition set out in 26 U.S.C. 5845(a) are also subject to the provisions of 27 CFR Part 479. Any person engaged in the business of importing firearms or ammunition as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a) must obtain a license under the provisions of 27 CFR Part 478, and if he imports firearms which fall within the definition of 26 U.S.C. 5845(a) must also register and pay special tax pursuant to the provisions of 27 CFR Part 479. Such licensing, registration and special tax requirements are in addition to registration under subpart D of this part.

(b) The permit procedures of subpart E of this part are applicable to all importations of articles on the U.S. Munitions Import List not subject to controls under 27 CFR Part 478 or 479. U.S. Munitions Import List articles subject to controls under 27 CFR Part 478 or 27 CFR Part 479 are subject to the import permit procedures of those regulations if imported into the United States (within the meaning of 27 CFR Parts 478 and 479).

(c) Articles on the U.S. Munitions Import List imported for the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof are exempt from the import controls of 27 CFR Part 478 but are not exempt from control under Section 38, Arms Export Control Act of 1976, unless imported by the United States or any agency thereof. All such importations not imported by the United States or any agency thereof shall be subject to the import permit procedures of subpart E of this part.

(d) For provisions requiring the registration of persons engaged in the business of brokering activities with respect to the importation of any defense article or defense service, see Department of State regulations in 22 CFR part 129.

##### Subpart B - Definitions

###### § 447.11 Meaning of terms.

When used in this part and in forms prescribed under this part, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this section. Words in the plural form shall include the singular, and vice versa, and words imparting the masculine gender shall include the feminine. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude other things not enumerated which are in the same general class or are otherwise within the scope thereof.

The Code of Federal Regulations.

A substance useful in war which, by its ordinary and direct chemical action, produces a powerful physiological effect.

Any item designated in § 447.21 or § 447.22. This term includes models, mockups, and other such items which reveal technical data directly relating to § 447.21 or § 447.22.

The Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20226.

Signed with the prescribed declaration under the penalties of perjury as provided on or with respect to the application, form, or other document or, where no form of declaration is prescribed, with the declaration: “I declare under the penalties of perjury that this ______ (insert type of document such as statement, certificate, application, or other document), including the documents submitted in support thereof, has been examined by me and, to best of my knowledge and belief, is true, correct, and complete.”

A weapon, and all components and parts therefor, not over .50 caliber which will or is designed to or may be readily converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, but shall not include BB and pellet guns, and muzzle loading (black powder) firearms (including any firearm with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system) or firearms covered by Category I(a) established to have been manufactured in or before 1898.

The term “frame or receiver” shall have the same meaning as in 27 CFR 478.12.

Bringing into the United States from a foreign country any of the articles on the Import List, but shall not include intransit, temporary import or temporary export transactions subject to Department of State controls under Title 22, Code of Federal Regulations.

The list of articles contained in § 447.21 and identified therein as “The U.S. Munitions Import List”.

A “machinegun”, “machine pistol”, “submachinegun”, or “automatic rifle” is a firearm which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person. For purposes of this definition, the term “automatically” as it modifies “shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot,” means functioning as the result of a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that allows the firing of multiple rounds through a single function of the trigger; and “single function of the trigger” means a single pull of the trigger and analogous motions.

(1) The term “frame” means the part of a handgun, or variants thereof, that provides housing or a structure for the component (sear or equivalent) designed to hold back the hammer, striker, bolt, or similar primary energized component prior to initiation of the firing sequence, even if pins or other attachments are required to connect such component (sear or equivalent) to the housing or structure.

(2) The term “receiver” means the part of a rifle, shotgun, or projectile weapon other than a handgun, or variants thereof, that provides housing or a structure for the primary component designed to block or seal the breech prior to initiation of the firing sequence (bolt, breechblock, or equivalent), even if pins or other attachments are required to connect such component to the housing or structure.

(3) The terms “variant” and “variants thereof” mean a weapon utilizing a similar frame or receiver design irrespective of new or different model designations or configurations, characteristics, features, components, accessories, or attachments. For example, an AK-type firearm with a short stock (pistol grip) is a pistol variant of an AK-type rifle, an AR-type firearm with a short stock (pistol grip) is a pistol variant of an AR-type rifle, and a revolving cylinder shotgun is a shotgun variant of a revolver.

(4) The following are nonexclusive examples that illustrate the above definitions:

(i)The frame is the part of the revolver that provides a structure designed to hold the sear.

(ii)The frame is the lower portion of the pistol, or grip, that provides housing for the sear.

(iii)The frame is the lower portion of the pistol, or grip, that provides housing for the sear.

(iv)The frame is the internal removable chassis of the pistol that provides housing for the sear or equivalent component.

(v)The receiver is the part of the rifle that provides a structure for the bolt.

(vi)The receiver is the part of the rifle or shotgun that provides housing for the bolt, breechblock, or equivalent.

(vii)The receiver is the part of the weapon that provides housing for the bolt.

(viii)The receiver is the central part of the weapon that provides housing for the bolt.

(ix)The receiver is the upper part of the weapon that provides housing for the bolt.

(b)The terms “frame” and “receiver” shall mean, in the case of a firearm muffler or firearm silencer, the part of the firearm, such as an outer tube or modular piece, that provides housing or a structure for the primary internal component designed to reduce the sound of a projectile (baffles, baffling material, expansion chamber, or equivalent). In the case of a modular firearm muffler or firearm silencer device with more than one such part, the terms shall mean the principal housing attached to the weapon that expels a projectile, even if an adapter or other attachments are required to connect the part to the weapon. The terms shall not include a removable end cap of an outer tube or modular piece.

(c)The terms “frame” and “receiver” shall include a partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional frame or receiver, including a frame or receiver parts kit, that is designed to or may readily be completed, assembled, restored, or otherwise converted to function as a frame or receiver,to house or provide a structure for the primary energized component of a handgun, breech blocking or sealing component of a projectile weapon other than a handgun, or internal sound reduction component of a firearm muffler or firearm silencer, as the case may be. The terms shall not include a forging, casting, printing, extrusion, unmachined body, or similar article that has not yet reached a stage of manufacture where it is clearly identifiable as an unfinished component part of a weapon (unformed block of metal, liquid polymer, or other raw material). When issuing a classification, the Director may consider any associated templates, jigs, molds, equipment, tools, instructions, guides, or marketing materials that are sold, distributed, or possessed with the item or kit, or otherwise made available by the seller or distributor of the item or kit to the purchaser or recipient of the item or kit. The following are nonexclusive examples that illustrate the definitions:

(d)The term “multi-piece frame or receiver” shall mean a frame or receiver that may be disassembled into multiple modular subparts,standardized units that may be replaced or exchanged. The term shall not include the internal frame of a pistol that is a complete removable chassis that provides housing for the sear or equivalent component, unless the chassis itself may be disassembled. The modular subpart(s) identified in accordance with § 478.92 with an importer's or manufacturer's serial number shall be presumed, absent an official determination by the Director or other reliable evidence to the contrary, to be part of the frame or receiver of a weapon or device.

(e)The terms “frame” and “receiver” shall not include a frame or receiver that is destroyed. For purposes of these definitions, the term “destroyed” means that the frame or receiver has been permanently altered such that it may not readily be completed, assembled, restored, or otherwise converted to function as a frame or receiver.

However, it shall not be necessary for a licensed importer or a licensed manufacturer to also obtain a dealer's license in order to engage in business on the licensed premises as a dealer in the same type of firearms authorized by the license to be imported or manufactured. Payment of the license fee as an importer or manufacturer of destructive devices, ammunition for destructive devices or armor piercing ammunition or as a dealer in destructive devices includes the privilege of importing or manufacturing firearms other than destructive devices and ammunition for other than destructive devices or ammunition other than armor piercing ammunition, or dealing in firearms other than destructive devices, as the case may be, by such a licensee at the licensed premises.

(c) Each person seeking the privileges of a collector licensed under this part shall file an application, with the required fee (see § 478.42), with ATF in accordance with the instructions on the form (see § 478.44), and pursuant to § 478.47, receive from the Chief, Federal Firearms Licensing Center, the license covering the collection of curios and relics. A separate license may be obtained for each collection premises, and such license shall, subject to the provisions of the Act and other applicable provisions of law, entitle the licensee to transport, ship, receive, and acquire curios and relics in interstate or foreign commerce, and to make disposition of curios and relics in interstate or foreign commerce, to any other person licensed under the provisions of this part, for the period stated on the license.

(d) The collector license provided by this part shall apply only to transactions related to a collector's activity in acquiring, holding or disposing of curios and relics. A collector's license does not authorize the collector to engage in a business required to be licensed under the Act or this part. Therefore, if the acquisitions and dispositions of curios and relics by a collector bring the collector within the definition of a manufacturer, importer, or dealer under this part, he shall qualify as such. (See also § 478.93 of this part.)

###### § 478.42 License fees.

Each applicant shall pay a fee for obtaining a firearms license or ammunition license, a separate fee being required for each business or collecting activity at each place of such business or activity, as follows:

###### § 478.43 License fee not refundable.

No refund of any part of the amount paid as a license fee shall be made where the operations of the licensee are, for any reason, discontinued during the period of an issued license. However, the license fee submitted with an application for a license shall be refunded if that application is denied or withdrawn by the applicant prior to being acted upon.

Such petition should be filed with the U.S. district court for the district in which the applicant or licensee resides or has his principal place of business.

(A) The model, if such designation has been made;

(B) The caliber or gauge;

(C) When applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer; and

(D) In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in which it was manufactured. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134.

If more than one subpart is similarly designed to house, hold, or contain such primary component (left and right halves), each of those subparts must be identified with the same serial number and associated licensee information not duplicated on any other frame or receiver. The identified subpart(s) of a complete (assembled or unassembled) multi-piece frame or receiver shall not be removed and replaced (§ 478.34, 18 U.S.C. 922(k), and 26 U.S.C. 5861(g) and (h)), unless&#x2014;

(C) The original subpart is destroyed under the licensed manufacturer's control or direct supervision prior to such placement.

(iv)Each part defined as a frame or receiver or modular subpart thereof described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, machinegun, or firearm muffler or firearm silencer that is not a component part of a complete weapon or complete muffler or silencer device at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by the licensee must be identified as required by this section with an individual serial number not duplicated on any other firearm and all additional identifying information, except that the model designation and caliber or gauge may be omitted if that information is unknown at the time the part is identified.

(v)The engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number and additional information must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch, and the serial number and any associated license number in a print size no smaller thaninch. The size of the serial and license number is measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of the character impression bottoms (bases).

For purposes of these subparagraphs, firearms awaiting materials, parts, or equipment repair to be completed are presumed, absent reliable evidence to the contrary, to be in the manufacturing process.

(A)Complete weapons not defined as firearms under 26 U.S.C. 5845 shall be identified not later than the seventh day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the weapon, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner. Each part, including a replacement part, defined as a frame or receiver or modular subpart thereof described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section (other than a machinegun or firearm muffler or firearm silencer) that is not a component part of a complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of shall be identified not later than the seventh day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the frame or receiver or modular subpart, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner.

(B)Complete weapons defined as firearms under 26 U.S.C. 5845, and complete muffler or silencer devices, shall be identified not later than close of the next business day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the weapon or device, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner. Each part or modular subpart defined as a machinegun (frame or receiver or conversion part), or firearm muffler or firearm silencer, that is not a component part of a complete weapon or complete firearm muffler or silencer device at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of shall be identified not later than close of the next business day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the part, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner.

(2)Unless previously identified by another licensee in accordance with, and except as otherwise provided by, this section, licensees must legibly and conspicuously identify each privately made firearm or “PMF” received or otherwise acquired (including from a personal collection) not later than the seventh day following the date of receipt or other acquisition, or before the date of disposition (including to a personal collection), whichever is sooner. PMFs must be identified by placing, or causing to be placed under the licensee's direct supervision, an individual serial number on the frame or receiver, which must not duplicate any serial number placed by the licensee on any other firearm. The serial number must begin with the licensee's abbreviated Federal firearms license number, which is the first three and last five digits, as a prefix to a unique identification number, followed by a hyphen,“12345678-[unique identification number]”. The serial number must be placed in a manner otherwise in accordance with this section, including the requirements that the serial number be at the minimum size and depth, and not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed. An acceptable method of identifying a PMF is by placing the serial number on a metal plate that is permanently embedded into a polymer frame or receiver, or other method approved by the Director.

(3)For purposes of this section, the term “identify” means placing marks of identification, the terms “legible” and “legibly” mean that the identification markings (including a unique identification number) use exclusively Roman letters (A, a, B, b, C, c) and Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3), or solely Arabic numerals, and may include a hyphen, and the terms “conspicuous” and “conspicuously” mean that the identification markings are capable of being easily seen with the naked eye during normal handling of the firearm, and are unobstructed by other markings when the complete weapon or device is assembled.

(4)&#x2014;(i)The Director may authorize other means of identification to identify firearms upon receipt of a letter application or prescribed form from the licensee showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this part.

(ii)In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize other means of identification to identify that weapon upon receipt of a letter application or prescribed form from the licensee. The application shall show that engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon as required by this section would be dangerous or impracticable and that the alternate means of identification proposed will not hinder the effective administration of this part.

(iii)Licensees may adopt existing markings previously placed on a firearm and are not required to mark a serial number or other identifying markings in accordance with this section, as follows:

(A)Licensed manufacturers may adopt the serial number and other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm by another licensed manufacturer provided the firearm has not been sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of to a person other than a licensee, and the serial number adopted is not duplicated on any other firearm.

(B)Licensed manufacturers and licensed importers may adopt the serial number or other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm that otherwise meets the requirements of this section that has been sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of to a person other than a licensee provided that, within the period and in the manner herein prescribed, the licensee legibly and conspicuously places, or causes to be placed, on the frame or receiver either: Their name (or recognized abbreviation), and city and State (or recognized abbreviation) where they maintain their place of business; or their name (or recognized abbreviation) and abbreviated Federal firearms license number, which is the first three and last five digits, individually (not as a prefix to the serial number adopted) after the letters “FFL”, in the following format: “FFL12345678”. The serial number adopted must not duplicate any serial number adopted or placed on any other firearm, except that if a licensed importer receives two or more firearms with the same foreign manufacturer's serial number, the importer may adopt the serial number by adding letters or numbers to that serial number, and may include a hyphen.

(C)Licensed manufacturers may adopt the serial number or other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm by another licensee provided the manufacturer is performing services for a nonlicensee as a gunsmith (as defined in § 478.11) on existing firearms not for sale or distribution.

(D)Unless previously identified by another licensee in accordance with this section, licensees may adopt a unique identification number previously placed on a privately made firearm by an unlicensed person, but not duplicated on any other firearm of the licensee, that otherwise meets the identification requirements of this section provided that, within the period and in the manner herein prescribed, the licensee legibly and conspicuously places, or causes to be placed, on the frame or receiver thereof a serial number beginning with their abbreviated Federal firearms license number, which is the first three and last five digits, followed by a hyphen, before the existing unique identification number,“12345678-[unique identification number]”.

(iv)(A)Licensed manufacturers qualified under 27 CFR part 479 may transfer a part defined as a firearm muffler or firearm silencer to another qualified manufacturer without immediately identifying or registering such part provided that it is for further manufacture (machining, coating,) or manufacturing a complete muffler or silencer device. Once the new device with such part is completed, the manufacturer who completes the device shall identify, record, and register it in the manner and within the period specified in this part for a complete muffler or silencer device.

(B)Licensed manufacturers qualified under part 479 may transfer a replacement part defined as a firearm muffler or firearm silencer other than a frame or receiver to a qualified manufacturer or dealer without identifying or registering such part provided that it is for repairing a complete muffler or silencer device that was previously identified, recorded, and registered in accordance with this part and part 479.

(v)Licensed manufacturers and licensed importers may continue to identify the same component of a firearm (other than a PMF) defined as a frame or receiver as it existed before August 24, 2022 with the same information required to be marked by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section that were in effect prior to that date, and any rules necessary to ensure such identification shall remain effective for that purpose. Any frame or receiver with a new design manufactured after August 24, 2022 must be marked with the identifying information and within the period prescribed by this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “new design” means that the design of the existing frame or receiver has been functionally modified or altered, as distinguished from performing a cosmetic process that adds to or changes the decoration of the frame or receiver (painting or engraving), or by adding or replacing stocks, barrels, or accessories to the frame or receiver.

(vi)Licensees shall identify in the manner prescribed by this section, or cause another person to so identify, each privately made firearm received or otherwise acquired (including from a personal collection) by the licensee before August 24, 2022within sixty (60) days from that date, or prior to the date of final disposition (including to a personal collection), whichever is sooner.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Each licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of armor piercing ammunition shall identify such ammunition by means of painting, staining or dying the exterior of the projectile with an opaque black coloring. This coloring must completely cover the point of the projectile and at least 50 percent of that portion of the projectile which is visible when the projectile is loaded into a cartridge case.

(2)Each licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of armor piercing ammunition shall clearly and conspicuously label each package in which armor piercing ammunition is contained, e.g., each box, carton, case, or other container. The label shall include the words “ARMOR PIERCING” in block letters at leastinch in height. The lettering shall be located on the exterior surface of the package which contains information concerning the caliber or gauge of the ammunition. There shall also be placed on the same surface of the package in block lettering at leastinch in height the words “FOR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR EXPORTATION ONLY.” The statements required by this subparagraph shall be on a contrasting background.

(c)The Director may issue a determination (classification) to a person whether an item, including a kit, is a firearm or armor piercing ammunition as defined in this part upon receipt of a written request or form prescribed by the Director. Each such voluntary request or form submitted shall be executed under the penalties of perjury with a complete and accurate description of the item or kit, the name and address of the manufacturer or importer thereof, and a sample of such item or kit for examination. A firearm sample must include all accessories and attachments relevant to such classification as each classification is limited to the firearm in the configuration submitted. Each request for classification of a partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional item or kit must contain any associated templates, jigs, molds, equipment, or tools that are made available by the seller or distributor of the item or kit to the purchaser or recipient of the item or kit, and any instructions, guides, or marketing materials if they will be made available by the seller or distributor with the item or kit. Upon completion of the examination, the Director may return the sample to the person who made the request unless a determination is made that return of the sample would be or place the person in violation of law. Submissions of armor piercing ammunition with a projectile or projectile core constructed entirely from one or a combination of tungsten steel alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium must include a list of known handguns in which the ammunition may be used. Except for the classification of a specific component as the frame or receiver of a particular weapon, a determination made by the Director under this paragraph shall not be deemed by any person to be applicable to or authoritative with respect to any other sample, design, model, or configuration.

###### § 478.93 Authorized operations by a licensed collector.

The license issued to a collector of curios or relics under the provisions of this part shall cover only transactions by the licensed collector in curios and relics. The collector's license is of no force or effect and a licensed collector is of the same status under the Act and this part as a nonlicensee with respect to (a) any acquisition or disposition of firearms other than curios or relics, or any transportation, shipment, or receipt of firearms other than curios or relics in interstate or foreign commerce, and (b) any transaction with a nonlicensee involving any firearm other than a curio or relic. (See also § 478.50.) A collectors license is not necessary to receive or dispose of ammunition, and a licensed collector is not precluded by law from receiving or disposing of armor piercing ammunition. However, a licensed collector may not dispose of any ammunition to a person prohibited from receiving or possessing ammunition (see § 478.99(c)). Any licensed collector who disposes of armor piercing ammunition must record the disposition as required by § 478.125 (a) and (b).

###### § 478.94 Sales or deliveries between licensees.

A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer selling or otherwise disposing of firearms, and a licensed collector selling or otherwise disposing of curios or relics, to another licensee shall verify the identity and licensed status of the transferee prior to making the transaction. Verification shall be established by the transferee furnishing to the transferor a certified copy of the transferee's license and by such other means as the transferor deems necessary:That it shall not be required (a) for a transferee who has furnished a certified copy of its license to a transferor to again furnish such certified copy to that transferor during the term of the transferee's current license, (b) for a licensee to furnish a certified copy of its license to another licensee if a firearm is being returned either directly or through another licensee to such licensee and (c) for licensees of multilicensed business organizations to furnish certified copies of their licenses to other licensed locations operated by such organization:That a multilicensed business organization may furnish to a transferor, in lieu of a certified copy of each license, a list, certified to be true, correct and complete, containing the name, address, license number, and the date of license expiration of each licensed location operated by such organization, and the transferor may sell or otherwise dispose of firearms as provided by this section to any licensee appearing on such list without requiring a certified copy of a license therefrom. A transferor licensee who has the certified information required by this section may sell or dispose of firearms to a licensee for not more than 45 days following the expiration date of the transferee's license.

###### § 478.95 Certified copy of license.

The license furnished to each person licensed under the provisions of this part contains a purchasing certification statement. This original license may be reproduced and the reproduction then certified by the licensee for use pursuant to § 478.94. If the licensee desires an additional copy of the license for certification (instead of making a reproduction of the original license), the licensee may submit a request, in writing, for a certified copy or copies of the license to the Chief, Federal Firearms Licensing Center. The request must set forth the name, trade name (if any) and address of the licensee, and the number of license copies desired. There is a charge of $1 for each copy. The fee paid for copies of the license must accompany the request for copies. The fee may be paid by cash, or money order or check made payable to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

###### § 478.96 Out-of-State and mail order sales.

(a) The provisions of this section shall apply when a firearm is purchased by or delivered to a person not otherwise prohibited by the Act from purchasing or receiving it.

(b) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may sell a firearm that is not subject to the provisions of § 478.102(a) to a nonlicensee who does not appear in person at the licensee's business premises if the nonlicensee is a resident of the same State in which the licensee's business premises are located, and the nonlicensee furnishes to the licensee the firearms transaction record, Form 4473, required by § 478.124. The nonlicensee shall attach to such record a true copy of any permit or other information required pursuant to any statute of the State and published ordinance applicable to the locality in which he resides. The licensee shall prior to shipment or delivery of the firearm, forward by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) a copy of the record, Form 4473, to the chief law enforcement officer named on such record, and delay shipment or delivery of the firearm for a period of at least 7 days following receipt by the licensee of the return receipt evidencing delivery of the copy of the record to such chief law enforcement officer, or the return of the copy of the record to him due to the refusal of such chief law enforcement officer to accept same in accordance with U.S. Postal Service regulations. The original Form 4473, and evidence of receipt or rejection of delivery of the copy of the Form 4473 sent to the chief law enforcement officer shall be retained by the licensee as a part of the records required of him to be kept under the provisions of subpart H of this part.

(c)(1) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may sell or deliver a rifle or shotgun, and a licensed collector may sell or deliver a rifle or shotgun that is a curio or relic to a nonlicensed resident of a State other than the State in which the licensee's place of business is located if&#x2014;

(i) The purchaser meets with the licensee in person at the licensee's premises to accomplish the transfer, sale, and delivery of the rifle or shotgun;

(ii) The licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer complies with the provisions of § 478.102;

(iii) The purchaser furnishes to the licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer the firearms transaction record, Form 4473, required by § 478.124; and

(iv) The sale, delivery, and receipt of the rifle or shotgun fully comply with the legal conditions of sale in both such States.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, any licensed manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both such States.

###### § 478.97 Loan or rental of firearms.

(a) A licensee may lend or rent a firearm to any person for temporary use off the premises of the licensee for lawful sporting purposes:That the delivery of the firearm to such person is not prohibited by § 478.99(b) or § 478.99(c), the licensee complies with the requirements of § 478.102, and the licensee records such loan or rental in the records required to be kept by him under Subpart H of this part.

(b) A club, association, or similar organization temporarily furnishing firearms (whether by loan, rental, or otherwise) to participants in a skeet, trap, target, or similar shooting activity for use at the time and place such activity is held does not, unattended by other circumstances, cause such club, association, or similar organization to be engaged in the business of a dealer in firearms or as engaging in firearms transactions. Therefore, licensing and recordkeeping requirements contained in this part pertaining to firearms transactions would not apply to this temporary furnishing of firearms for use on premises on which such an activity is conducted.

###### § 478.98 Sales or deliveries of destructive devices and certain firearms.

The sale or delivery by a licensee of any destructive device, machine gun, short-barreled shotgun, or short-barreled rifle, to any person other than another licensee who is licensed under this part to deal in such device or firearm, is prohibited unless the person to receive such device or firearm furnishes to the licensee a sworn statement setting forth

(a) The reasons why there is a reasonable necessity for such person to purchase or otherwise acquire the device or weapon; and

(b) That such person's receipt or possession of the device or weapon would be consistent with public safety. Such sworn statement shall be made on the application to transfer and register the firearm required by Part 479 of this chapter. The sale or delivery of the device or weapon shall not be made until the application for transfer is approved by the Director and returned to the licensee (transferor) as provided in Part 479 of this chapter.

###### § 478.99 Certain prohibited sales or deliveries.

(a)A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector shall not sell or deliver any firearm to any person not licensed under this part and who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in (or if a corporation or other business entity, does not maintain a place of business in) the State in which the licensee's place of business or activity is located:That the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (1) shall not apply to the sale or delivery of a rifle or shotgun (curio or relic, in the case of a licensed collector) to a resident of a State other than the State in which the licensee's place of business or collection premises is located if the requirements of § 478.96(c) are fully met, and (2) shall not apply to the loan or rental of a firearm to any person for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes (see § 478.97).

(iii) An official of a foreign government or a distinguished foreign visitor who has been so designated by the Department of State. This exception only applies if the firearm or ammunition is shipped, transported, possessed, or received in the official's or visitor's official capacity, except if the visitor is a private individual who does not have an official capacity; or

However, licensees shall comply with the provisions of § 478.91 relating to posting of licenses (or a copy thereof) while conducting business at the gun show or event.

(2) A licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may engage in the business of dealing in curio or relic firearms with another licensee at any location.

(b) A gun show or an event is a function sponsored by any national, State, or local organization, devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms, or an organization or association that sponsors functions devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms in the community.

(b)In any transaction for which a licensee receives a transaction number from NICS (which shall include either a NICS transaction number or, in States where the State is recognized as a point of contact for NICS checks, a State transaction number), such number shall be recorded on a firearms transaction record, Form 4473, which shall be retained in the records of the licensee in accordance with the provisions of § 478.129. This applies regardless of whether the transaction is approved or denied by NICS, and regardless of whether the firearm is actually transferred.

(c)A NICS check conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be relied upon by the licensee only for use in a single transaction, and for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days from the date that NICS was initially contacted. If the transaction is not completed within the 30-day period, the licensee shall initiate a new NICS check prior to completion of the transfer.

(a) Any person who applies to be a licensed firearms dealer must certify on ATF Form 7 (5310.12), Application for Federal Firearms License, that compatible secure gun storage or safety devices will be available at any place where firearms are sold under the license to nonlicensed individuals (subject to the exception that in any case in which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily unavailable because of theft, casualty, loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any other similar reason beyond the control of the licensee, the dealer shall not be considered in violation of the requirement to make available such a device).

(b) Any person who applies to be a licensed firearms importer or a licensed manufacturer and will be engaged in business on the licensed premises as a dealer in the same type of firearms authorized by the license to be imported or manufactured must make the certification required under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Each licensee described in this section must have compatible secure gun storage or safety devices available at any place in which firearms are sold under the license to persons who are not licensees.

##### Subpart G - Importation

###### § 478.111 General.

In the event the licensee records a duplicate entry with the same firearm and acquisition information, whether to close out an old record book or for any other reason, the licensee shall record a reference to the date and location of the subsequent entry (date of new entry, book name/number, page number, and line number) as the disposition. The information required by this paragraph shall be entered in the proper record book not later than the seventh day following the date of the transaction.

(b) A licensed manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer shall retain in alphabetical (by name of purchaser), chronological (by date of disposition), or numerical (by transaction number) order, and as a part of the required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course of transferring custody of the firearms.

(c)(1) Prior to making an over-the-counter transfer of a firearm to a nonlicensee who is a resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises is located, the licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer so transferring the firearm shall obtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the transferee's name, sex, residence address (including county or similar political subdivision), date and place of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the transferee's country of citizenship; the transferee's INS-issued alien number or admission number; the transferee's State of residence; and certification by the transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce.

(2) In order to facilitate the transfer of a firearm and enable NICS to verify the identity of the person acquiring the firearm, ATF Form 4473 also requests certain optional information. This information includes the transferee's social security number. Such information may help avoid the possibility of the transferee being misidentified as a felon or other prohibited person.

(3) After the transferee has executed the Form 4473, the licensee:

(i) Shall verify the identity of the transferee by examining the identification document (as defined in § 478.11) presented, and shall note on the Form 4473 the type of identification used;

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) Must, in the case of a transferee who is an alien admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa who states that he or she falls within an exception to, or has a waiver from, the prohibition in section 922(g)(5)(B) of the Act, have the transferee present applicable documentation establishing the exception or waiver, note on the Form 4473 the type of documentation provided, and attach a copy of the documentation to the Form 4473; and

(iv) Shall comply with the requirements of § 478.102 and record on the form the date on which the licensee contacted the NICS, as well as any response provided by the system, including any identification number provided by the system.

(4) The licensee shall identify the firearm to be transferred by listing on the Form 4473 the name of the manufacturer, the name of the importer (if any), the type, model, caliber or gauge, and the serial number (including any associated license number either as a prefix, or if remanufactured or imported, separated by a semicolon) of the firearm. Where no manufacturer name has been identified on a privately made firearm, the words “privately made firearm” (or abbreviation “PMF”) shall be recorded as the name of the manufacturer.

(5) The licensee shall sign and date the form if the licensee does not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the transferee is disqualified by law from receiving the firearm and transfer the firearm described on the Form 4473.

(d) Prior to making an over-the-counter transfer of a shotgun or rifle under the provisions contained in § 478.96(c) to a nonlicensee who is not a resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises is located, the licensee so transferring the shotgun or rifle, and such transferee, shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(e) Prior to making a transfer of a firearm to any nonlicensee who is not a resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises is located, and such nonlicensee is acquiring the firearm by loan or rental from the licensee for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, the licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer so furnishing the firearm, and such transferee, shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

(f) Form 4473 shall be submitted, in duplicate, to a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer by a transferee who is purchasing or otherwise acquiring a firearm by other than an over-the-counter transaction, who is not subject to the provisions of § 478.102(a), and who is a resident of the State in which the licensee's business premises are located. The Form 4473 shall show the name, address, date and place of birth, height, weight, and race of the transferee; and the title, name, and address of the principal law enforcement officer of the locality to which the firearm will be delivered. The transferee also must date and execute the sworn statement contained on the form showing, in case the firearm to be transferred is a firearm other than a shotgun or rifle, the transferee is 21 years or more of age; in case the firearm to be transferred is a shotgun or rifle, the transferee is 18 years or more of age; whether the transferee is a citizen of the United States; the transferee's State of residence; the transferee is not prohibited by the provisions of the Act from shipping or transporting a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce; and the transferee's receipt of the firearm would not be in violation of any statute of the State or published ordinance applicable to the locality in which the transferee resides. The licensee shall identify the firearm to be transferred by listing in the Forms 4473 the name of the manufacturer, the name of the importer (if any), the type, model, caliber or gauge, and the serial number of the firearm to be transferred. Where no manufacturer name has been identified on a privately made firearm, the words “privately made firearm” (or abbreviation “PMF”) shall be recorded as the name of the manufacturer. The licensee shall prior to shipment or delivery of the firearm to such transferee, forward by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) a copy of the Form 4473 to the principal law enforcement officer named in the Form 4473 by the transferee, and shall delay shipment or delivery of the firearm to the transferee for a period of at least 7 days following receipt by the licensee of the return receipt evidencing delivery of the copy of the Form 4473 to such principal law enforcement officer, or the return of the copy of the Form 4473 to the licensee due to the refusal of such principal law enforcement officer to accept same in accordance with U.S. Postal Service regulations.

(g) A licensee who sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm to a nonlicensee who is other than an individual, shall obtain from the transferee the information required by this section from an individual authorized to act on behalf of the transferee. In addition, the licensee shall obtain from the individual acting on behalf of the transferee a written statement, executed under the penalties of perjury, that the firearm is being acquired for the use of and will be the property of the transferee, and showing the name and address of that transferee.

(h) The requirements of this section shall be in addition to any other recordkeeping requirement contained in this part.

(h)Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (e), and (f) of this section, the Director of Industry Operations may authorize alternate records to be maintained by a licensed dealer or licensed collector to record the acquisition and disposition of firearms or curios or relics and the disposition of armor piercing ammunition when it is shown by the licensed dealer or the licensed collector that such alternate records will accurately and readily disclose the required information. A licensed dealer or licensed collector who proposes to use alternate records shall submit a letter application, in duplicate, to the Director of Industry Operations and shall describe the proposed alternate records and the need therefor. Such alternate records shall not be employed by the licensed dealer or licensed collector until approval in such regard is received from the Director of Industry Operations.

No information or evidence obtained from an application, registration, or record required to be submitted or retained by a natural person in order to comply with any provision of 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53, or this part or section 207 of the Gun Control Act of 1968 shall be used, directly or indirectly, as evidence against that person in a criminal proceeding with respect to a violation of law occurring prior to or concurrently with the filing of the application or registration, or the compiling of the record containing the information or evidence:That the provisions of this section shall not preclude the use of any such information or evidence in a prosecution or other action under any applicable provision of law with respect to the furnishing of false information.

###### § 479.24 Destructive device determination.

The Director shall determine in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5845(f), whether a device is excluded from the definition of a destructive device. A person who desires to obtain a determination under that provision of law for any device which he believes is not likely to be used as a weapon shall submit a written request, in triplicate, for a ruling thereon to the Director. Each such request shall be executed under the penalties of perjury and contain a complete and accurate description of the device, the name and address of the manufacturer or importer thereof, the purpose of and use for which it is intended, and such photographs, diagrams, or drawings as may be necessary to enable the Director to make his determination. The Director may require the submission to him, of a sample of such device for examination and evaluation. If the submission of such device is impracticable, the person requesting the ruling shall so advise the Director and designate the place where the device will be available for examination and evaluation.

###### § 479.25 Collector's items.

The Director shall determine in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5845(a), whether a firearm or device, which although originally designed as a weapon, is by reason of the date of its manufacture, value, design, and other characteristics primarily a collector's item and is not likely to be used as a weapon. A person who desires to obtain a determination under that provision of law shall follow the procedures prescribed in § 479.24 relating to destructive device determinations, and shall include information as to date of manufacture, value, design and other characteristics which would sustain a finding that the firearm or device is primarily a collector's item and is not likely to be used as a weapon.

###### § 479.26 Alternate methods or procedures; emergency variations from requirements.

(a)Any person subject to the provisions of this part, on specific approval by the Director as provided in this paragraph, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The Director may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when it is found that:

(1) Good cause is shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;

(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure and that the alternate method or procedure is substantially equivalent to that specifically prescribed method or procedure; and

(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part. Where such person desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, a written application shall be submitted to the appropriate Director, Industry Operations, for transmittal to the Director. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure and shall set forth the reasons for it. Alternate methods or procedures may not be employed until the application is approved by the Director. Such person shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization of any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the authorization.

(b)The Director may approve a method of operation other than as specified in this part, where it is found that an emergency exists and the proposed variation from the specified requirements are necessary and the proposed variations (1) will not hinder the effective administration of this part, and (2) will not be contrary to any provisions of law. Variations from requirements granted under this paragraph are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith with the procedures, conditions, and limitations shall automatically terminate the authority for the variations, and the person granted the variance shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the variation. Where a person desires to employ an emergency variation, a written application shall be submitted to the appropriate Director, Industry Operations for transmittal to the Director. The application shall describe the proposed variation and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed until the application is approved.

(c)The person granted the variance shall retain and make available for examination by ATF officers any application approved by the Director under this section.

##### Subpart D - Special (Occupational) Taxes

###### § 479.31 Liability for tax.

(a)Every person who engages in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in (including pawnbrokers) firearms in the United States shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by § 479.32. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the taxable business, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. Special (occupational) tax shall not be prorated. The tax shall be computed for the entire tax year (July 1 through June 30), regardless of the portion of the year during which the taxpayer engages in business. Persons commencing business at any time after July 1 in any year are liable for the special (occupational) tax for the entire tax year.

(b)An importer, manufacturer, or dealer in firearms incurs special tax liability at each place of business where an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous. See also §§ 479.38&#x2013;479.39.

###### § 479.32 Special (occupational) tax rates.

Except as provided in § 479.32a, the special (occupational) tax rates effective January 1, 1988, are as follows:

###### § 479.32a Reduced rate of tax for small importers and manufacturers.

(a)Effective January 1, 1988, 26 U.S.C. 5801(b) provides for a reduced rate of special tax with respect to any importer or manufacturer whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 479.32 relates) are less than $500,000. The rate of tax for such an importer or manufacturer is $500 per year or fraction thereof. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, quality for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.

(b)All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (a) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563&#x2013;1 through 1.1563&#x2013;4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.

(c)Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period, as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(d)Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during that year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

###### § 479.33 Special exemption.

(a) Any person required to pay special (occupational) tax under this part shall be relieved from payment of that tax if he establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that his business is conducted exclusively with, or on behalf of, the United States or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof. The Director may relieve any person manufacturing firearms for or on behalf of the United States from compliance with any provision of this part in the conduct of the business with respect to such firearms.

(b) The exemption in this section may be obtained by filing with the Director an application, in letter form, setting out the manner in which the applicant conducts his business, the type of firearm to be manufactured, and proof satisfactory to the Director of the existence of the contract with the United States, department, independent establishment, or agency thereof, under which the applicant intends to operate.

###### § 479.34 Special tax registration and return.

(a)Special tax shall be paid by return. The prescribed return is ATF Form 5630.7, Special Tax Registration and Return. Special tax returns, with payment of tax, shall be filed with ATF in accordance with instructions on the form. Properly completing, signing, and timely filing of a return (Form 5630.7) constitutes compliance with 26 U.S.C. 5802.

(b)All of the information called for on Form 5630.7 shall be provided, including:

(1) The true name of the taxpayer.

(2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to special tax.

(3) The employer identification number (see § 479.35).

(4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some description in addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two or more locations, the address to be shown shall be the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer).

(5) The class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.

(6) Ownership and control information: That is, the name, position, and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person having power to control its management and policies with respect to the activity subject to special tax. “Owner of the business” shall include every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 10% or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be stated if the same information has been previously provided to ATF in connection with a license application under Part 478 of this chapter, and if the information previously provided is still current.

(c)A taxpayer subject to special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more than one class of tax shall&#x2014;

(1) File one special tax return, ATF Form 5630.7, with payment of tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and

(2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's name, address (as shown on ATF Form 5630.7), employer identification number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by States, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which special tax is being paid. The original of the list shall be filed with ATF in accordance with instructions on the return, and the copy shall be retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for not less than 3 years.

(d)&#x2014;(1)The return of an individual proprietor shall be signed by the individual. The return of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner. The return of a corporation shall be signed by any officer. In each case, the person signing the return shall designate his or her capacity as “individual owner,” “member of firm,” or, in the case of a corporation, the title of the officer.

(2)Receivers, trustees, assignees, executors, administrators, and other legal representatives who continue the business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased person, etc., shall indicate the fiduciary capacity in which they act.

(3)If a return is signed by an agent or attorney in fact, the signature shall be preceded by the name of the principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is filed, with the ATF office with which the return is required to be filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.

(4)ATF Forms 5630.7 shall contain or be verified by a written declaration that the return has been executed under the penalties of perjury.

(e)If the taxpayer is an individual, with the initial return such person shall securely attach to Form 5630.7 a photograph of the individual 2 &#xD7; 2 inches in size, clearly showing a full front view of the features of the individual with head bare, with the distance from the top of the head to the point of the chin approximately 1inches, and which shall have been taken within 6 months prior to the date of completion of the return. The individual shall also attach to the return a properly completed FBI Form FD&#x2013;258 (Fingerprint Card). The fingerprints must be clear for accurate classification and should be taken by someone properly equipped to take them:That the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to individuals who have filed with ATF a properly executed Application for License under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, Firearms, ATF Form 7 (5310.12), as specified in § 478.44(a).

###### § 479.35 Employer identification number.

(a)The employer identification number (defined in 26 CFR 301.7701&#x2013;12) of the taxpayer who has been assigned such a number shall be shown on each special tax return, including amended returns, filed under this subpart. Failure of the taxpayer to include the employer identification number may result in the imposition of the penalty specified in § 70.113 of this chapter.

(b)Each taxpayer who files a special tax return, who has not already been assigned an employer identification number, shall file IRS Form SS&#x2013;4 to apply for one. The taxpayer shall apply for and be assigned only one employer identification number, regardless of the number of places of business for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The employer identification number shall be applied for no later than 7 days after the filing of the taxpayer's first special tax return. IRS Form SS&#x2013;4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center or from any IRS district director.

(c)The taxpayer shall prepare and file IRS Form SS&#x2013;4, together with any supplementary statement, in accordance with the instructions on the form or issued in respect to it.

###### § 479.36 The special tax stamp, receipt for special (occupational) taxes.

Upon filing a properly completed and executed return (Form 5630.7) accompanied by remittance of the full amount due, the taxpayer will be issued a special tax stamp as evidence of payment of the special (occupational) tax.

###### § 479.37 Certificates in lieu of stamps lost or destroyed.

When a special tax stamp has been lost or destroyed, such fact should be reported immediately to the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch who issued the stamp. A certificate in lieu of the lost or destroyed stamp will be issued to the taxpayer upon the submission of an affidavit showing to the satisfaction of the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch that the stamp was lost or destroyed.

###### § 479.38 Engaging in business at more than one location.

A person shall pay the special (occupational) tax for each location where he engages in any business taxable under 26 U.S.C. 5801. However, a person paying a special (occupational) tax covering his principal place of business may utilize other locations solely for storage of firearms without incurring special (occupational) tax liability at such locations. A manufacturer, upon the single payment of the appropriate special (occupational) tax, may sell firearms, if such firearms are of his own manufacture, at the place of manufacture and at his principal office or place of business if no such firearms, except samples, are kept at such office or place of business. When a person changes the location of a business for which he has paid the special (occupational) tax, he will be liable for another such tax unless the change is properly registered with the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch for the region in which the special tax stamp was issued, as provided in § 479.46.

###### § 479.39 Engaging in more than one business at the same location.

If more than one business taxable under 26 U.S.C. 5801, is carried on at the same location during a taxable year, the special (occupational) tax imposed on each such business must be paid. This section does not require a qualified manufacturer or importer to qualify as a dealer if such manufacturer or importer also engages in business on his qualified premises as a dealer. However, a qualified manufacturer who engages in business as an importer must also qualify as an importer. Further, a qualified dealer is not entitled to engage in business as a manufacturer or importer.

###### § 479.40 Partnership liability.

Any number of persons doing business in partnership at any one location shall be required to pay but one special (occupational) tax.

###### § 479.41 Single sale.

A single sale, unattended by circumstances showing the one making the sale to be engaged in business, does not create special (occupational) tax liability.

##### Subpart E - Tax on Making Firearms

###### § 479.61 Rate of tax.

Except as provided in this subpart, there shall be levied, collected, and paid upon the making of a firearm a tax at the rate of $200 for each firearm made. This tax shall be paid by the person making the firearm. Payment of the tax on the making of a firearm shall be represented by a $200 adhesive stamp bearing the words “National Firearms Act.” The stamps are maintained by the Director.

##### Subpart F - Transfer Tax

###### § 479.81 Scope of tax.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, each transfer of a firearm in the United States is subject to a tax to be represented by an adhesive stamp of the proper denomination bearing the words “National Firearms Act” to be affixed to the Form 4 (Firearms), Application for Transfer and Registration of Firearm, as provided in this subpart.

###### § 479.82 Rate of tax.

The transfer tax imposed with respect to firearms transferred within the United States is at the rate of $200 for each firearm transferred, except that the transfer tax on any firearm classified as “any other weapon” shall be at the rate of $5 for each such firearm transferred. The tax imposed on the transfer of the firearm shall be paid by the transferor.

###### § 479.83 Transfer tax in addition to import duty.

The transfer tax imposed by section 5811, I.R.C., is in addition to any import duty.

##### Subpart G - Registration and Identification of Firearms

###### § 479.101 Registration of firearms.

(a) The Director shall maintain a central registry of all firearms in the United States which are not in the possession of or under the control of the United States. This registry shall be known as the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record and shall include:

(1) Identification of the firearm as required by this part;

(2) Date of registration; and

(3) Identification and address of person entitled to possession of the firearm as required by this part.

(b) Each manufacturer, importer, and maker shall register each firearm he manufactures, imports, or makes in the manner prescribed by this part. Each firearm transferred shall be registered to the transferee by the transferor in the manner prescribed by this part. No firearm may be registered by a person unlawfully in possession of the firearm except during an amnesty period established under section 207 of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 1235).

(c) A person shown as possessing firearms by the records maintained by the Director pursuant to the National Firearms Act (26 U.S.C. Chapter 53) in force on October 31, 1968, shall be considered to have registered the firearms in his possession which are disclosed by that record as being in his possession on October 31, 1968.

(d) The National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record shall include firearms registered to the possessors thereof under the provisions of section 207 of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

(e) A person possessing a firearm registered to him shall retain proof of registration which shall be made available to any ATF officer upon request.

(f) A firearm not identified as required by this part shall not be registered.

###### § 479.102 Identification of firearms.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in this section, you, as a manufacturer, importer, or maker of a firearm, must legibly identify the firearm as follows:

(1)By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed) or otherwise placed on the frame or receiver thereof, an individual serial number, in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed. The serial number must not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. The frame or receiver must also be marked with either: Your name (or recognized abbreviation), and city and State (or recognized abbreviation) where you as a manufacturer or importer maintain your place of business, or in the case of a maker, where you made the firearm; or if a manufacturer or importer, your name (or recognized abbreviation) and the serial number that begins with your abbreviated Federal firearms license number, which is the first three and last five digits, as a prefix to a unique identification number, followed by a hyphen,“12345678-[unique identification number]”; and

(2)By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver, or barrel or pistol slide (if applicable) thereof certain additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed. The additional information shall include:

(i) The model, if such designation has been made;

(ii) The caliber or gauge;

(iii) When applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer or maker; and

(iv) In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in which it was manufactured. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134.

(3)In the case of a multi-piece frame or receiver, the modular subpart that is the outermost housing or structure designed to house, hold, or contain either the primary energized component of a handgun, breech blocking or sealing component of a projectile weapon other than a handgun, or internal sound reduction component of a firearm muffler or firearm silencer, as the case may be, shall be the subpart of a multi-piece frame or receiver identified in accordance with this section. If more than one subpart is similarly designed to house, hold, or contain such primary component (left and right halves), each of those subparts must be identified with the same serial number and associated licensee information not duplicated on any other frame or receiver. The identified subpart(s) of a complete (assembled or unassembled) multi-piece frame or receiver shall not be removed and replaced (§ 478.34 of this subchapter, 18 U.S.C. 922(k), and 26 U.S.C. 5861(g) and (h)), unless&#x2014;

(i) The subpart replacement is not a firearm under 26 U.S.C. 5845;

(ii) The subpart replacement is identified by the qualified manufacturer of the original subpart with the same serial number and associated licensee information in the manner prescribed by this section; and

(iii) The original subpart is destroyed under the manufacturer's control or direct supervision prior to such placement.

(4)Each part defined as a frame or receiver or modular subpart thereof described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, machinegun, or firearm muffler or firearm silencer that is not a component part of a complete weapon or complete muffler or silencer device at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you must be identified as required by this section with an individual serial number not duplicated on any other firearm and all additional identifying information, except that the model designation and caliber or gauge may be omitted if that information is unknown at the time the part is identified.

(5)The engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number and additional information must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch, and the serial number and any associated license number in a print size no smaller thaninch. The size of the serial and license number is measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of the character impression bottoms (bases). The depth of all markings required by this section is measured from the flat surface of the metal and not the peaks or ridges.

(6)You, as a manufacturer, shall identify a complete weapon or complete muffler or silencer device no later than close of the next business day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the weapon or device, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner. You must identify each part or modular subpart defined as a machine gun (frame or receiver, or conversion part) or muffler or silencer that is not a component part of a complete weapon or complete muffler or silencer device at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of no later than close of the next business day following the date the entire manufacturing process has ended for the part, or prior to disposition, whichever is sooner. For purposes of this paragraph, firearms awaiting materials, parts, or equipment repair to be completed are presumed, absent reliable evidence to the contrary, to be in the manufacturing process. Importers must identify imported firearms within the period prescribed in § 478.112 of this subchapter.

(7)For purposes of this section, the term “identify” means placing marks of identification, the terms “legible” and “legibly” mean that the identification markings (including any unique identification number) use exclusively Roman letters (A, a, B, b, C, c) and Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3), or solely Arabic numerals, and may include a hyphen, and the terms “conspicuous” and “conspicuously” mean that the identification markings are capable of being easily seen with the naked eye during normal handling of the firearm and are unobstructed by other markings when the complete weapon or device is assembled.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The Director may authorize other means of identification to identify firearms upon receipt of a letter application or prescribed form from you showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this part.

(2)In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize other means of identification to identify that weapon upon receipt of a letter application or prescribed form from you. The application shall show that engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon as required by this section would be dangerous or impracticable and that the alternate means of identification proposed will not hinder the effective administration of this part.

(3)You may adopt existing markings and are not required to mark a serial number or other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm in accordance with this section, as follows:

(i)Manufacturers may adopt the serial number and other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm by another manufacturer provided the firearm has not been sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of to a person other than a qualified manufacturer, importer, or dealer, and the serial number adopted is not duplicated on any other firearm.

(ii)Manufacturers and importers may adopt the serial number or other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm that otherwise meets the requirements of this section that has been sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of to a person other than a licensee provided that, within the period and in the manner herein prescribed, the manufacturer or importer legibly and conspicuously places, or causes to be placed, on the frame or receiver either: Their name (or recognized abbreviation), and city and State (or recognized abbreviation) where they maintain their place of business; or their name (or recognized abbreviation) and abbreviated Federal firearms license number, which is the first three and last five digits, individually (not as a prefix to the serial number adopted) after the letters “FFL”, in the following format: “FFL12345678”. The serial number adopted must not duplicate any serial number adopted or placed on any other firearm, except that if an importer receives two or more firearms with the same foreign manufacturer's serial number, the importer may adopt the serial number by adding letters or numbers to that serial number, and may include a hyphen.

(iii)Manufacturers may adopt the serial number or other identifying markings previously placed on a firearm by a qualified manufacturer, importer, or dealer, provided the manufacturer is performing services as a gunsmith (as defined in § 478.11 of this subchapter) on existing firearms not for sale or distribution.

(4)(i)Manufacturers qualified under this part may transfer a part defined as a muffler or silencer to another qualified manufacturer without immediately identifying or registering such part provided that it is for further manufacture (machining, coating,) or manufacturing a complete muffler or silencer device. Once the new device with such part is completed, the manufacturer who completes the device shall identify and register it in the manner and within the period specified in this part for a complete muffler or silencer device.

(ii)Manufacturers qualified under this part may transfer a replacement part defined as a muffler or silencer other than a frame or receiver to a qualified manufacturer or dealer without identifying or registering such part provided that it is for repairing a complete muffler or silencer device that was previously identified and registered in accordance with this part and part 478.

(5)Manufacturers and importers may continue to identify the same component of a firearm defined as a frame or receiver as it existed before August 24, 2022 with the same information required to be marked by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section that were in effect prior to that date, and any rules necessary to ensure such identification shall remain effective for that purpose. Any frame or receiver with a new design manufactured after August 24, 2022 must be marked with the identifying information and within the period prescribed by this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “new design” means that the design of the existing frame or receiver has been functionally modified or altered, as distinguished from performing a cosmetic process that adds to or changes the decoration of the frame or receiver (painting or engraving), or by adding or replacing stocks, barrels, or accessories to the frame or receiver.

(c)The Director may issue a determination (classification) to a person whether an item, including a kit, is a firearm as defined in this part upon receipt of a written request or form prescribed by the Director. Each such voluntary request or form submitted shall be executed under the penalties of perjury with a complete and accurate description of the item or kit, the name and address of the manufacturer or importer thereof, and a sample of such item or kit for examination. A firearm sample must include all accessories and attachments relevant to such classification as each classification is limited to the firearm in the configuration submitted. Each request for classification of a partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional item or kit must contain any associated templates, jigs, molds, equipment, or tools that are made available by the seller or distributor of the item or kit to the purchaser or recipient of the item or kit, and any instructions, guides, or marketing materials if they will be made available by the seller or distributor with the item or kit. Upon completion of the examination, the Director may return the sample to the person who made the request unless a determination is made that return of the sample would be or place the person in violation of law. Except for the classification of a specific component as the frame or receiver of a particular weapon, a determination made by the Director under this paragraph shall not be deemed by any person to be applicable to or authoritative with respect to any other sample, design, model, or configuration.

###### § 479.103 Registration of firearms manufactured.

Each manufacturer qualified under this part shall file with the Director an accurate notice on Form 2 (Firearms), Notice of Firearms Manufactured or Imported, executed under the penalties of perjury, to show his manufacture of firearms. The notice shall set forth the name and address of the manufacturer, identify his special (occupational) tax stamp and Federal firearms license, and show the date of manufacture, the type, model, length of barrel, overall length, caliber, gauge or size, serial numbers, and other marks of identification of the firearms he manufactures, and the place where the manufactured firearms will be kept. Except as provided in § 479.102(b)(4), all firearms manufactured by him during a single day shall be included on one notice, Form 2 (Firearms), filed by the manufacturer no later than the close of the next business day. The manufacturer shall prepare the notice, Form 2 (Firearms), in duplicate, file the original notice as prescribed herein and keep the copy with the records required by subpart I of this part at the premises covered by his special (occupational) tax stamp. Receipt of the notice, Form 2 (Firearms), by the Director shall effectuate the registration of the firearms listed on that notice.

The appeal request must include appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge. Any record or document of a court or other government entity or official furnished in support of an appeal must be certified by the court or other government entity or official as a true copy. In the case of an employee, or responsible person who did not submit fingerprints, such appeal must be accompanied by two properly completed FBI Forms FD&#x2013;258 (fingerprint card). The Director will advise the individual in writing of his decision and the reasons for the decision.

(2)The letter of denial, among other things, will advise an employee who elects to challenge an adverse determination to submit the fingerprint cards as described above. The employee also will be advised of the agency name and address that originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (“originating agency”). At that time, and where appropriate, an employee is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record system and correct the record. The employee may provide to ATF additional and appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge to ATF's decision to uphold the initial denial. If ATF does not receive such additional documentation or record(s) within 45 days of the date of the decision upholding the initial denial, ATF will close the appeal.

(3)The letter of denial, among other things, will advise a responsible person of the agency name and address which originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (“originating agency”). A responsible person who elects to challenge the adverse determination, where appropriate, is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record system and correct the record. A responsible person may provide additional documentation or records as specified for employees in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

###### § 555.34 Replacement of stolen or lost ATF Form 5400.30 (Intrastate Purchase of Explosives Coupon (IPEC)).

When any Form 5400.30 is stolen, lost, or destroyed, the person losing possession will, upon discovery of the theft, loss, or destruction, immediately, but in all cases before 24 hours have elapsed since discovery, report the matter to the Director by telephoning 1&#x2013;888&#x2013;ATF-BOMB (nationwide toll free number). The report will explain in detail the circumstances of the theft, loss, or destruction and will include all known facts that may serve to identify the document. Upon receipt of the report, the Director will make such investigation as appears appropriate and may issue a duplicate document upon such conditions as the circumstances warrant.

A type 1 magazine is a permanent structure: a building, an igloo or “Army-type structure”, a tunnel, or a dugout. It is to be bullet-resistant, fire-resistant, weather-resistant, theft-resistant, and ventilated.

(a)All building type magazines are to be constructed of masonry, wood, metal, or a combination of these materials, and have no openings except for entrances and ventilation. The ground around building magazines must slope away for drainage or other adequate drainage provided.

(1)Masonry wall construction is to consist of brick, concrete, tile, cement block, or cinder block and be not less than 6 inches in thickness. Hollow masonry units used in construction must have all hollow spaces filled with well-tamped, coarse, dry sand or weak concrete (at least a mixture of one part cement and eight parts of sand with enough water to dampen the mixture while tamping in place). Interior walls are to be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material.

(2)Metal wall construction is to consist of sectional sheets of steel or aluminum not less than number 14-gauge, securely fastened to a metal framework. Metal wall construction is either lined inside with brick, solid cement blocks, hardwood not less than four inches thick, or will have at least a six inch sand fill between interior and exterior walls. Interior walls are to be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material.

(3)The exterior of outer wood walls is to be covered with iron or aluminum not less than number 26-gauge. An inner wall of, or covered with nonsparking material will be constructed so as to provide a space of not less than six inches between the outer and inner walls. The space is to be filled with coarse, dry sand or weak concrete.

(4)Floors are to be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material and shall be strong enough to bear the weight of the maximum quantity to be stored. Use of pallets covered with a nonsparking material is considered equivalent to a floor constructed of or covered with a nonsparking material.

(5)Foundations are to be constructed of brick, concrete, cement block, stone, or wood posts. If piers or posts are used, in lieu of a continuous foundation, the space under the buildings is to be enclosed with metal.

(6)Except for buildings with fabricated metal roofs, the outer roof is to be covered with no less than number 26-guage iron or aluminum, fastened to at leastinch sheathing.

Padlocks must have at least five tumblers and a casehardened shackle of at leastinch diameter. Padlocks must be protected with not less thaninch steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the locks, hasps, and staples. These requirements do not apply to magazine doors that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt, lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.

(10)Ventilation is to be provided to prevent dampness and heating of stored explosive materials. Ventilation openings must be screened to prevent the entrance of sparks. Ventilation openings in side walls and foundations must be offset or shielded for bullet-resistant purposes. Magazines having foundation and roof ventilators with the air circulating between the side walls and the floors and between the side walls and the ceiling must have a wooden lattice lining or equivalent to prevent the packages of explosive materials from being stacked against the side walls and blocking the air circulation.

(11)No sparking material is to be exposed to contact with the stored explosive materials. All ferrous metal nails in the floor and side walls, which might be exposed to contact with explosive materials, must be blind nailed, countersunk, or covered with a nonsparking lattice work or other nonsparking material.

(b)Igloo, “Army-type structure”, tunnel, and dugout magazines are to be constructed of reinforced concrete, masonry, metal, or a combination of these materials. They must have an earthmound covering of not less than 24 inches on the top, sides and rear unless the magazine meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of this section. Interior walls and floors must be constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material. Magazines of this type are also to be constructed in conformity with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) and paragraphs (a)(8) through (11) of this section.

(h) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters;

(i) Render recommended decisions in proceedings on applications for licenses and permits and on revocation or denial of renewal of licenses or permits;

(j) Call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, including hostile or adverse witnesses, when the administrative law judge deems such action to be necessary to a just disposition of the case, and introduce into the record documentary or other evidence; and

(k) Take any other action authorized by rule of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.5 U.S.C. 556(c) and 18 U.S.C. 843.

###### § 771.98 Separation of functions.

Administrative law judges shall perform no functions inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities. The Director may assign administrative law judges duties not inconsistent with the performance of their functions as administrative law judges. Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as required by law, no administrative law judge shall consult any person or party as to any fact in issue unless there has been notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. The functions of the administrative law judge shall be entirely separated from the general investigative functions of the agency. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in any proceeding shall, in that proceeding or a factually related proceeding, participate or advise in the administrative law judge's or Director's decision, or in the agency review on appeal, except as a witness or counsel in the proceedings. The administrative law judge may not informally obtain advice or opinions from the parties or their counsel, or from any officer or employee of the ATF, as to the facts or the weight or interpretation to be given to the evidence. The administrative law judge may, however, informally obtain advice on matters of law or procedure in a proceeding from officers or employees who were not engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in that proceeding or a factually related proceeding. The administrative law judge may, at any time, consult with and obtain instructions from the Director on questions of law and policy. Furthermore, it is not a violation of the separation of functions for the administrative law judge to participate in the questioning of witnesses, where the questioning is for clarification or to move the proceedings along, and where the questioning is not so extensive as to place the administrative law judge in the position of a prosecuting officer.

###### § 771.99 Conduct of hearing.

The administrative law judge is charged with the duty of conducting a fair and impartial hearing and of maintaining order in form and manner consistent with the dignity of a court proceeding. In the event that counsel or any person or witness in any proceeding shall refuse to obey the orders of the administrative law judge, or be guilty of disorderly or contemptuous language or conduct in connection with any hearing, the administrative law judge may, for good cause stated in the record, suspend the hearing, and, in the case of disorderly or contemptuous language or conduct by an attorney, report the matter to the Department of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility.28 CFR 0.39a(a)(9). The refusal of a witness to answer any question that has been ruled to be proper shall be considered by the administrative law judge in determining the weight to be given all the testimony of that witness.

###### § 771.100 Unavailability of administrative law judge.

In the event that the administrative law judge designated to conduct a hearing becomes unavailable before the filing of his findings and recommended decision, the Director may assign the case to another administrative law judge for the continuance of the proceeding, in accordance with the regulations in this part in the same manner as if he had been designated administrative law judge at the commencement of the proceeding.

##### Subpart H - Decisions

###### § 771.105 Administrative law judge's findings and recommended decision.

Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as possible, the administrative law judge shall render his recommended decision. All decisions shall become a part of the record and, if proposed findings and conclusions have been filed, shall show the administrative law judge's ruling upon each of such proposed findings and conclusions. Decisions shall consist of:

(a) A brief statement of the issues of fact involved in the proceeding;

(b) The administrative law judge's findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor with record references, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record (including, when appropriate, comment as to the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses); and

(c) The administrative law judge's recommended determination as to the revocation or denial at issue.

###### § 771.106 Certification and transmittal of record and decision.

After reaching his decision, the administrative law judge shall certify the complete record of the proceeding before him and shall immediately forward the complete certified record together with one copy of the administrative law judge's recommended decision to the Director of Industry Operations for initial decision, one copy of the recommended decision to the applicant or the applicant's representative, and one copy of the recommended decision to the Attorney for the Government.

##### Subpart I - Review

###### § 771.120 Appeal on petition to the Director.

(a) An appeal to the Director may be made by the applicant, licensee, or permittee, or by the Director of Industry Operations (DIO). For the applicant, licensee, or permittee, such appeal shall be made by filing a petition for review on appeal with the Director within 15 days of the service of the adverse initial decision by the Director of Industry Operations. For the Director of Industry Operations, such appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for review on appeal with the Director within 15 days of the issuance of the administrative law judge's decision recommending against revocation or denial of renewal. The petitioning applicant, licensee, or permittee must submit arguments showing that the Director of Industry Operations' initial decision, and if applicable the underlying administrative law judge's recommended decision, was without reasonable warrant in fact or contrary to law and regulations. The petitioning DIO must submit arguments showing the administrative law judge's recommended decision was without reasonable warrant in fact or contrary to law and regulations. Nothing in this part shall limit the authority of the Director to review the administrative law judge's decision exercising all the powers that he would have in making the recommended decision.

(b) A copy of the petition shall be filed with the Director of Industry Operations or served on the applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be. In the event of an appeal, the Director of Industry Operations shall immediately certify and forward the complete original record, by certified mail, to the Director, for his consideration and review.

###### § 771.121 Review by Director.

(a)On appeal, the Director shall afford a reasonable opportunity for the submission of proposed findings, conclusions, or exceptions with reasons in support thereof and an opportunity for oral argument. The Director may alter or modify any finding of the administrative law judge (or of the Director of Industry Operations as the case may be) and may affirm, reverse, or modify the recommended decision of the administrative law judge, or the initial decision of the Director of Industry Operations, or may remand the case for further hearing, but shall not consider evidence that is not a part of the record.

(b)Except in the case of a remand, when, on appeal, the Director affirms the initial decision of the Director of Industry Operations or the recommended decision of the administrative law judge, as the case may be, such decision shall be the agency's final decision.

(c)Appeals and petitions for review shall not be decided by the Director in any proceeding in which the Director has engaged in an investigation or prosecution and in such event the Director shall so state his disqualification in writing and refer the record to the Deputy Director for appropriate action. The Deputy Director may designate an Assistant Director or one of the Deputy Director's principal aides to consider any proceeding instead of the Director. The original copy of the decision on review shall be placed in the official record of the proceeding, a signed duplicate original shall be served upon the applicant, licensee, or permittee, and a copy shall be transmitted to the Director of Industry Operations.

###### § 771.122 Denial of renewal or revocation.

If the Director orders the denial of an application, a copy of the application marked “Disapproved” will be returned to the applicant by the Director of Industry Operations. If the Director orders a revocation of a license of permit, any stay of revocation will be withdrawn and the revocation will become effective upon the order of the Director of Industry Operations. After the issuance of a denial of a renewal application or a revocation, and pending the final determination of a timely appeal, the licensee or permittee may continue operations, if at all, pursuant to § 555.83 of this chapter.

###### § 771.123 Court review.

(a) If an applicant, licensee, or permittee files an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principle place of business, within 60 days after the receipt of the Director's decision, the Director, upon notification that an appeal has been taken, shall prepare the record for submission to the court in accordance with applicable court rules.

(b) If an applicant, licensee, or permittee does not seek review with the Director, but instead seeks review within 60 days after the receipt of the initial decision of the Director of Industry Operations pursuant to § 771.109, the Director of Industry Operations, upon notification that an appeal has been taken, shall prepare the record for submission to the court in accordance with applicable court rules. The Director of Industry Operations shall notify the Director if such an appeal is taken.

(c) The Director, or the Director of Industry Operations, as the case may be, shall certify the correctness of the transcript of the record, forward one copy to the attorney for the Government in the review of the case, and file the original record of the proceedings with the original certificate in the appropriate United States Court of Appeals.

##### Subpart J - Miscellaneous

###### § 771.124 Depositions.

The administrative law judge may take or order the taking of depositions by either party to the proceeding at such time and place as the administrative law judge may designate before a person having the power to administer oaths, upon application therefor and notice to the parties to the action. The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition, or a person under his direction, and the deposition shall be subscribed by the deponent unless subscribing thereof is waived in writing by the parties.

###### § 771.125 Witnesses and fees.

Witnesses summoned before the administrative law judge may be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear and the person taking the deposition shall be paid by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.

###### § 771.126 Discovery.

The discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are not controlling with respect to agency proceedings under this part. However, fundamental fairness requires a party be given the opportunity to know what evidence is offered and a chance to rebut such evidence. Either party may petition the administrative law judge for non-burdensome discovery if the party can demonstrate that the interests of justice require disclosure of these materials.

###### § 771.127 Privileges.

The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 559, provides that, except as otherwise required by law, privileges relating to procedure or evidence apply equally to agencies and persons. Therefore, an agency may rely on judicially-approved privileges to resist production of its files where appropriate.
