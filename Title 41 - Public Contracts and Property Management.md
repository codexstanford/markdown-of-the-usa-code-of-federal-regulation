#### PART 50-201 - GENERAL REGULATIONS

##### § 50-201.1 The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.

The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 35&#x2013;45), hereinafter referred to as the Act, was enacted “to provide conditions for the purchase of supplies and the making of contracts by the United States.” It is not an act of general applicability to industry. The Supreme Court has described it as an instruction by the Government to its agents who were selected and granted final authority to fix the terms and conditions under which the Government will permit goods to be sold to it. Its purpose, according to the Supreme Court “was to impose obligations upon those favored with Government business and to obviate the possibility that any part of our tremendous national expenditures would go to forces tending to depress wages and purchasing power and offending fair social standards of employment.” (“Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co.,” 310 U.S. 113, 128 (1940); “Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins,” 317 U.S. 501 (1943).) To this end, the Act requires those who enter into contracts to perform Government work subject to its terms to adhere to specifically prescribed representations and stipulations as set forth in 41 CFR 50&#x2013;201.1 pertaining to qualifications of contractors, minimum wages, overtime pay, safe and sanitary working conditions of workers employed on the contract, the use of child labor or convict labor on the contract work, and the enforcement of such provisions. Except as otherwise specifically provided, these representations and stipulations are required to be included in every contract “for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, and equipment in any amount exceeding $10,000” which is made and entered into by an agency of the United States or other entity as designated in section 1 of the Act, hereinafter referred to as “contracting agency.” Contractors performing work subject to the Act thus “enter into competition to obtain Government business on terms of which they are fairly forwarned by inclusion in the contract.” (“Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, supra,” 317 U.S. at 507.) The Act also provides for enforcement of the required representations and stipulations by various methods. Certain exemptions from the application of the Act are provided in section 9 of the statute. Other exemptions, variations, and tolerances may be provided under section 6 of the statute by the Secretary of Labor or the President.

##### § 50-201.2 Administration of the Act.

(a) The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of the Act, to make investigations, findings, and decisions thereunder, and to make, amend, and rescind rules and regulations with respect to its application (see sections 4 and 5). The Supreme Court has recognized that the Secretary may issue rulings defining the coverage of the Act. (“Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, supra”.) According to the Court (ibid.), in the statute as originally enacted “Congress submitted the administration of the Act to the judgment of the Secretary of Labor, not to the judgment of the courts.” An amendment to the Act in 1952 added specific provisions for judicial review (see section 10). The Secretary has promulgated regulations to carry out provisions of the Act, which are set forth elsewhere in this chapter (Part 50&#x2013;201 (General Regulations); Part 50&#x2013;202 (Minimum Wage Determinations); Part 50&#x2013;203 (Rules of Practice); and Part 50&#x2013;204 (Safety and Health Standards)). The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division through the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards the authority to promulgate regulations and to issue official rulings and interpretations. So long as such regulations, rulings, and interpretations are not modified, amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial authority to be incorrect, they may be relied upon as provided in section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 84, 29 U.S.C. 251,discussed in 29 CFR part 790). Furthermore, these interpretations are intended to indicate the construction of the law which the Department of Labor believes to be correct and which will be followed in the administration of the Act unless and until directed otherwise by Act of Congress or by authoritative rulings of the courts. (“Skidmore v. Swift & Co.”, 323 U.S. 134 (1944), “Roland Co. v. Walling”, 326 U.S. 657 (1946); “Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, supra”, and “Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., supra”.)

(b) The courts have held that the “interpretations of the Walsh-Healey Act and the regulations adopted thereunder, as made by the Secretary of Labor acting through his Administrator, are both correct and reasonable.” (“Jno. McCall Coal Company v. United States,” 374 F. 2d 689, 692 (C.A. 4, 1967); see also “United States v. Davison Fuel and Dock Company,” 371 F. 2d 705, 711&#x2013;714 (C.A. 4, 1967).) These policies are designed to protect not only employees but also the competitive interest of all firms qualified to compete for covered contracts.

##### § 50-201.3 Insertion of stipulations.

Except as hereinafter directed, in every contract made and entered into by an executive department, independent establishment, or other agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any corporation all the stock of which is beneficially owned by the United States, for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, and equipment, the contracting officer shall cause to be inserted or incorporated by reference in such invitation or the specifications and in such contract, the following stipulations:

##### § 50-201.4 Statutory exemptions.

Inclusion of the stipulations enumerated in § 50&#x2013;201.1 is not required in the following instances:

(b) Where the contract relates to perishables, including dairy, livestock, and nursery products (“perishables” covers products subject to decay or spoilage and not products canned, salted, smoked, or otherwise preserved);

(c) Where the contract relates to agricultural or farm products processed for first sale by the original producers;

(d) Where the contract is by the Secretary of Agriculture for the purchase of agricultural commodities or the products thereof;

##### § 50-201.101 Employees affected.

The stipulations shall be deemed applicable only to employees engaged in or connected with the manufacture, fabrication, assembling, handling, supervision, or shipment of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment required under the contract, and shall not be deemed applicable to employees performing only office or custodial work, nor to any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or outside salesman capacity, as those terms are defined and delimited by the regulations (29 CFR part 541) applicable during the period of performance of the contract under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.

##### § 50-201.102 Overtime.

(b) Until otherwise set by the Secretary of Labor the rate of pay for such overtime shall be one and one-half times the basic hourly rate received by the employee. The “basic hourly rate” means an hourly rate equivalent to the rate upon which time-and-one-half overtime compensation may be computed and paid under section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. The basic hourly rate may, in no case, be less than the applicable minimum wage.

(c) If in any one week or part thereof an employee is engaged in work covered by the contract's stipulations, overtime shall be paid for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in any one week at the overtime rate set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) The overtime pay requirements of this section shall be deemed to be complied with in the case of any employee employed as provided in section 7(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of that section.

##### § 50-201.103 Dealer as agent of undisclosed principal.

Whenever a dealer, to whom a contract within the act and regulations in this part has been awarded, causes a manufacturer to deliver directly to the Government the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment required under the contract, such dealer will be deemed the agent of the manufacturer in executing the contract. As the principal of such agent the manufacturer will be deemed to have agreed to the stipulations contained in the contract.

##### § 50-201.104 Protection against unintentional employment of underage minors.

An employer shall not be deemed to have knowingly employed an underage minor in the performance of contracts subject to the Act if, during the period of the employment of such minor, the employer has on file an unexpired certificate of age issued and held pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under section 3(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR 570.121), showing that such minor is at least 16 years of age.

##### § 50-201.105 Hours worked.

(b) Whenever a final determination of a breach of stipulations is made, the Secretary of Labor will furnish to the contracting agency a copy of the findings and decision with such recommendations as will assist the contracting agency in determining whether or not the contract should be canceled for such breach.

##### § 50-201.301 Agency regulations.

Each agency which prescribes additional regulations for the Administration of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and for the implementation of the regulations in this part, shall submit such regulations, directives, and orders to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division prior to issuance.

Currently existing regulations are not affected by this section, except where such regulations are not in conformity with the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and the Department of Labor regulations. In such cases, agency regulations shall be appropriately revised.

#### PART 50-204 - SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY CONTRACTS

##### Subpart A - Scope and Application

###### § 50-204.1 Scope and application.

(a) The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act requires that contracts entered into by any agency of the United States for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, and equipment in any amount exceeding $10,000 must contain, among other provisions, a stipulation that “no part of such contract will be performed nor will any of the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment to be manufactured or furnished under said contract be manufactured or fabricated in any plants, factories, buildings, or surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of employees engaged in the performance of said contract. Compliance with the safety, sanitary, and factory inspection laws of the State in which the work or part thereof is to be performed shall be prima-facie evidence of compliance with this subsection.” (sec. 1(e)), 49 Stat. 2036, 41 U.S.C. 35(e)). This part 50&#x2013;204 expresses the Secretary of Labor's interpretation and application of this provision with regard to certain particular working conditions. In addition, §§ 50&#x2013;204.27, 50&#x2013;204.30, 50&#x2013;204.31, 50&#x2013;204.32, 50&#x2013;204.33, and 50&#x2013;204.36 contain requirements concerning the instruction of personnel, notification of incidents, reports of exposures, and maintenance and disclosure of records.

(b)(1) Every investigator conducting investigations and every officer of the Department of Labor determining whether there are or have been violations of the safety and health requirements of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and of any contract subject thereto; and whether a settlement of the resulting issues should be made without resort to administrative or court litigation, shall treat a failure to comply with, or violation of, any of the safety and health measures contained in this part 50&#x2013;204 as resulting in working conditions which are “unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of employees” within the meaning of section 1(e) of the Act and the contract stipulation it requires. Evidence of compliance with the safety, sanitary, and factory inspection laws of a State in which the work, or part thereof, is performed will be considered prima facie evidence of compliance with the safety and health requirements of the Act and of any contract subject thereto, and it shall be sufficient unless rebutted or overcome by a preponderance of evidence of a failure to comply with any applicable safety and health rules contained in this part.

(2) Every investigator shall have technical competence in safety, industrial hygiene, or both as may be appropriate, in the matters under investigation.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) The standards expressed in this part 50&#x2013;204 are for application to ordinary employment situations; compliance with them shall not relieve anyone from the obligation to provide protection for the health and safety of his employees in unusual employment situations. Neither do such standards purport to describe all of the working conditions which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of employees. Where such other working conditions may be found to be unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of employees, professionally accepted safety and health practices will be used.

(e) Compliance with the standards expressed in this part 50&#x2013;204 is not intended, and shall not be deemed to relieve anyone from any other obligation he may have to protect the health and safety of his employees, arising from sources other than the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, such as State, local law or collective bargaining agreement.

###### § 50-204.1a Variances.

(a) Variances from standards in this part may be granted in the same circumstances in which variances may be granted under sections 6(b)(6)(A) or 6(d) of the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655). The procedures for the granting of variances and for related relief under this part are those published in part 1905 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations.

(b) Any requests for variances shall also be considered requests for variances under the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and any variance from a standard which is contained in this part and which is incorporated in part 1910 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be deemed a variance from the standard under both the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. In accordance with the requirements of § 1954.3(d)(1)(i) of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, variance actions taken under State provisions under a State occupational safety and health plan approved under section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 with regard to State standards found to be at least as effective as the comparable Federal standards contained in this part and incorporated in part 1910 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be deemed a variance action from the standard under both the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

###### § 50-204.10 Occupational noise exposure.

(a) Protection against the effects of noise exposure shall be provided when the sound levels exceed those shown in Table I of this section when measured on the A scale of a standard sound level meter at slow response. When noise levels are determined by octave band analysis, the equivalent A-weighted sound level may be determined as follows:

(b) When employees are subject to sound exceeding those listed in Table I of this section, feasible administrative or engineering controls shall be utilized. If such controls fail to reduce sound levels within the levels of the table, personal protective equipment shall be provided and used to reduce sound levels within the levels of the table.

(c) If the variations in noise level involve maxima at intervals of 1 second or less, it is to be considered continuous.

(d) In all cases where the sound levels exceed the values shown herein, a continuing, effective hearing conservation program shall be administered.

##### Subpart C - Radiation Standards

###### § 50-204.20 Radiation - definitions.

As used in this subpart:

(a)includes alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons, high-speed electrons, high-speed protons, and other atomic particles; but such term does not include sound or radio waves, or visible light, or infrared or ultraviolet light.

(b)means any material which emits, by spontaneous nuclear disintegration, corpuscular or electromagnetic emanations.

(c)means any area access to which is controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials.

(d)means any area access to which is not controlled by the employer for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials.

(e)means the quantity of ionizing radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body. When the provisions in this subpart specify a dose during a period of time, the dose is the total quantity of radiation absorbed, per unit of mass, by the body or by any portion of the body during such period of time. Several different units of dose are in current use. Definitions of units used in this subpart are set forth in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.

(f)means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to body tissues in terms of the energy absorbed per unit of mass of the tissue. One rad is the dose corresponding to the absorption of 100 ergs per gram of tissue (1 millirad (mrad) = 0.001 rad).

(g)means a measure of the dose of any ionizing radiation to body tissue in terms of its estimated biological effect relative to a dose of 1 roentgen (r) of X-rays (1 millirem (mrem) = 0.001 rem). The relation of the rem to other dose units depends upon the biological effect under consideration and upon the conditions for irradiation. Each of the following is considered to be equivalent to a dose of 1 rem:

(1) A dose of 1 rad due to X- or gamma radiation;

(2) A dose of 1 rad due to X-, gamma, or beta radiation;

(3) A dose of 0.1 rad due to neutrons or high energy protons;

(4) A dose of 0.05 rad due to particles heavier than protons and with sufficient energy to reach the lens of the eye;

(5) If it is more convenient to measure the neutron flux, or equivalent, than to determine the neutron dose in rads, as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, 1 rem of neutron radiation may, for purposes of the provisions in this subpart be assumed to be equivalent to 14 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon the body; or, if there is sufficient information to estimate with reasonable accuracy the approximate distribution in energy of the neutrons, the incident number of neutrons per square centimeter equivalent to 1 rem may be estimated from the following table:

(h) For determining exposures to X-or gamma rays up to 3 Mev., the dose limits specified in this part may be assumed to be equivalent to the “air dose”. For the purpose of this subpart “air dose” means that the dose is measured by a properly calibrated appropriate instrument in air at or near the body surface in the region of the highest dosage rate.

###### § 50-204.21 Exposure of individuals to radiation in restricted areas.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no employer shall possess, use, or transfer sources of ionizing radiation in such a manner as to cause any individual in a restricted area to receive in any period of one calendar quarter from sources in the employer's possession or control a dose in excess of the limits specified in the following table:

(b) An employer may permit an individual in a restricted area to receive doses to the whole body greater than those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, so long as:

(1) During any calendar quarter the dose to the whole body shall not exceed 3 rems; and

(2) The dose to the whole body, when added to the accumulated occupational dose to the whole body, shall not exceed 5 (N&#x2013;18) rems, where “N” equals the individual's age in years at his last birthday; and

(3) The employer maintains adequate past and current exposure records which show that the addition of such a dose will not cause the individual to exceed the amount authorized in this paragraph. As used in this paragraph “Dose to the whole body” shall be deemed to include any dose to the whole body, gonad, active bloodforming organs, head and trunk, or lens of the eye.

(c) No employer shall permit any employee who is under 18 years of age to receive in any period of one calendar quarter a dose in excess of 10 percent of the limits specified in the table in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d)means any 3-month period determined as follows:

(1) The first period of any year may begin on any date in January:That the second, third, and fourth periods accordingly begin on the same date in April, July, and October, respectively, and that the fourth period extends into January of the succeeding year, if necessary to complete a 3-month quarter. During the first year of use of this method of determination, the first period for that year shall also include any additional days in January preceding the starting date for the first period; or

(2) The first period in a calendar year of 13 complete, consecutive calendar weeks; the second period in a calendar year of 13 complete, consecutive calendar weeks; the third period in a calendar year of 13 complete, consecutive calendar weeks; the fourth period in a calendar year of 13 complete, consecutive calendar weeks. If at the end of a calendar year there are any days not falling within a complete calendar week of that year, such days shall be included within the last complete calendar week of that year. If at the beginning of any calendar year there are days not falling within a complete calendar week of that year, such days shall be included within the last complete calendar week of the previous year; or

(3) The four periods in a calendar year may consist of the first 14 complete, consecutive calendar weeks; the next 12 complete, consecutive calendar weeks, the next 14 complete, consecutive calendar weeks, and the last 12 complete, consecutive calendar weeks. If at the end of a calendar year there are any days not falling within a complete calendar week of that year, such days shall be included (for purposes of this part) within the last complete calendar week of the year. If at the beginning of any calendar year there are days not falling within a complete calendar week of that year, such days shall be included (for purposes of this part) within the last complete week of the previous year.

(e) No employer shall change the method used by him to determine calendar quarters except at the beginning of a calendar year.

###### § 50-204.22 Exposure to airborne radioactive material.

(a) No employer shall possess, use or transport radioactive material in such a manner as to cause any employee, within a restricted area, to be exposed to airborne radioactive material in an average concentration in excess of the limits specified in Table I of appendix B to 10 CFR part 20. The limits given in Table I are for exposure to the concentrations specified for 40 hours in any workweek of 7 consecutive days. In any such period where the number of hours of exposure is less than 40, the limits specified in the table may be increased proportionately. In any such period where the number of hours of exposure is greater than 40, the limits specified in the table shall be decreased proportionately.

(b) No employer shall possess, use, or transfer radioactive material in such a manner as to cause any individual within a restricted area, who is under 18 years of age to be exposed to airborne radioactive material in an average concentration in excess of the limits specified in Table II of Appendix B to 10 CFR part 20. For purposes of this paragraph, concentrations may be averaged over periods not greater than 1 week.

(c)as used in this section means that the individual is present in an airborne concentration. No allowance shall be made for the use of protective clothing or equipment, or particle size, except as authorized by the Director, Bureau of Labor Standards.

###### § 50-204.23 Precautionary procedures and personnel monitoring.

(a) Every employer shall make such surveys as may be necessary for him to comply with the provisions in this subpart. “Survey” means an evaluation of the radiation hazards incident to the production, use, release, disposal, or presence of radioactive materials or other sources of radiation under a specific set of conditions. When appropriate, such evaluation includes a physical survey of the location of materials and equipment, and measurements of levels of radiation or concentrations of radioactive material present.

(b) Every employer shall supply appropriate personnel monitoring equipment, such as film badges, pocket chambers, pocket dosimeters, or film rings, to, and shall require the use of such equipment by:

(1) Each employee who enters a restricted area under such circumstances that he receives, or is likely to receive, a dose in any calendar quarter in excess of 25 percent of the applicable value specified in paragraph (a) of § 50&#x2013;204.21; and

(2) Each employee under 18 years of age who enters a restricted area under such circumstances that he receives, or is likely to receive, a dose in any calendar quarter in excess of 5 percent of the applicable value specified in paragraph (a) of § 50&#x2013;204.21; and

(3) Each employee who enters a high radiation area.

(c) As used in this subpart:

(a) It is the policy of the Government to increase employment and training opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through the purchase of commodities and services from qualified nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. The Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled (hereinafter the Committee) was established by the Javits-Wagner&#x2014;O'Day Act, Public Law 92&#x2013;28, 85 Stat. 77 (1971), as amended, 41 U.S.C. 46&#x2013;48c (hereinafter the JWOD Act). The Committee is responsible for implementation of a comprehensive program designed to enforce this policy.

(b) It is the policy of the Committee to encourage all Federal entities and employees to provide the necessary support to ensure that the JWOD Act is implemented in an effective manner. This support includes purchase of products and services published on the Committee's Procurement List through appropriate channels from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities designated by the Committee; recommendations to the Committee of new commodities and services suitable for addition to the Procurement List; and cooperation with the Committee and the central nonprofit agencies in the provision of such data as the Committee may decide is necessary to determine suitability for addition to the Procurement List.

##### § 51-1.2 Mandatory source priorities.

(a) The JWOD Act mandates that commodities or services on the Procurement List required by Government entities be procured, as prescribed in this regulation, from a nonprofit agency employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, at a price established by the Committee, if that commodity or service is available within the normal period required by that Government entity. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the JWOD Act has priority, under the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 48, over any other supplier of the Government's requirements for commodities and services on the Committee's Procurement List.

(b) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. has priority, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4124, over nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities in furnishing commodities for sale to the Government. All or a portion of the Government's requirement for a commodity for which Federal Prison Industries, Inc. has exercised its priority may be added to the Procurement List. However, such addition is made with the understanding that procurement under the JWOD Act shall be limited to that portion of the Government's requirement for the commodity which is not available or not required to be procured from Federal Prison Industries, Inc.

(c) The JWOD Act requires the Committee to prescribe regulations providing that, in the purchase by the Government of commodities produced and offered for sale by qualified nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind and nonprofit agencies employing persons who have other severe disabilities, priority shall be accorded to commodities produced and offered for sale by qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind. In approving the addition of commodities, to the Procurement List, the Committee accords priority to nonprofit agencies for the blind. Nonprofit agencies for the blind and nonprofit agencies employing persons with severe disabilities have equal priority for services.

##### § 51-2.2 Powers and responsibilities.

The Committee is responsible for carrying out the following functions in support of its mission of providing employment and training opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities and, whenever possible, preparing those individuals to engage in competitive employment:

(a) Establish rules, regulations, and policies to assure effective implementation of the JWOD Act.

(b) Determine which commodities and services procured by the Federal Government are suitable to be furnished by qualified nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities and add those items to the Committee's Procurement List. Publish notices of addition to the Procurement List in theDisseminate information on Procurement List items to Federal agencies. Delete items no longer suitable to be furnished by nonprofit agencies. Authorize and deauthorize central nonprofit agencies and nonprofit agencies to accept orders from contracting activities for the furnishing of specific commodities and services on the Procurement List.

(c) Determine fair market prices for items added to the Procurement List and revise those prices in accordance with changing market conditions to assure that the prices established are reflective of the market.

(d) Monitor nonprofit agency compliance with Committee regulations and procedures.

(e) Inform Federal agencies about the AbilityOne Program and the statutory mandate that items on the Procurement List be purchased from qualified nonprofit agencies, and encourage and assist entities of the Federal Government to identify additional commodities and services that can be purchased from qualified nonprofit agencies. To the extent possible, monitor Federal agencies' compliance with JWOD requirements.

(f) Designate, set appropriate ceilings on fee paid to these central nonprofit agencies by nonprofit agencies selling items under the AbilityOne Program, and provide guidance to central nonprofit agencies engaged in facilitating the distribution of Government orders and helping State and private nonprofit agencies participate in the AbilityOne Program.

(g) Conduct a continuing study and evaluation of its activities under the JWOD Act for the purpose of assuring effective and efficient administration of the JWOD Act. The Committee may study, independently, or in cooperation with other public or nonprofit private agencies, problems relating to:

(1) The employment of the blind or individuals with other severe disabilities.

(2) The development and adaptation of production methods which would enable a greater utilization of these individuals.

(h) Provide technical assistance to the central nonprofit agencies and the nonprofit agencies to contribute to the successful implementation of the JWOD Act.

(i) Assure that nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind will have priority over nonprofit agencies employing persons with severe disabilities in furnishing commodities.

##### § 51-2.3 Notice of proposed addition or deletion.

At least 30 days prior to the Committee's consideration of the addition or deletion of a commodity or service to or from the Procurement List, the Committee publishes a notice in theannouncing the proposed addition or deletion and providing interested persons an opportunity to submit written data or comments on the proposal. Interested persons submitting comments in bound form should also submit an unbound copy that is capable of being legibly photocopied.

##### § 51-2.4 Determination of suitability.

(a) For a commodity or service to be suitable for addition to the Procurement List, each of the following criteria must be satisfied:

(1)The proposed addition must demonstrate a potential to generate employment for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

(2)The nonprofit agency (or agencies) proposing to furnish the item must qualify as a nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, as set forth in part 51&#x2013;4 of this chapter.

(3)The nonprofit agency (or agencies) desiring to furnish a commodity or service under the JWOD Program must satisfy the Committee as to the extent of the labor operations to be performed and that it will have the capability to meet Government quality standards and delivery schedules by the time it assumes responsibility for supplying the Government.

(4)(i) In deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the Procurement List is likely to have a severe adverse impact on the current contractor for the specific commodity or service, the Committee gives particular attention to:

(A) The possible impact on the contractor's total sales, including the sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations. In addition, the Committee considers the effects of previous Committee actions.

(B) Whether that contractor has been a continuous supplier to the Government of the specific commodity or service proposed for addition and is, therefore, more dependent on the income from such sales to the Government.

(ii) If there is not a current contract for the commodity or service being proposed for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee may consider the most recent contractor to furnish the item to the Government as the current contractor for the purpose of determining the level of impact.

(b) In determining the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee also considers other information it deems pertinent, including comments on a proposal published in theto add the commodity or service to the Procurement List and information submitted by Government personnel and interested persons. Because the Committee's authority to establish fair market prices is separate from its authority to determine the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee does not consider comments on proposed fair market prices for commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List to be pertinent to a suitability determination.

##### § 51-2.5 Committee decision.

The Committee considers the particular facts and circumstances in each case in determining if a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List. When the Committee determines that a proposed addition is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it takes this fact into consideration in deciding not to add the commodity or service to the Procurement List, or to add only a portion of the Government requirement for the item. If the Committee decides to add a commodity or service in whole or in part to the Procurement List, that decision is announced in thewith a notice that includes information on the effective date of the addition.

##### § 51-2.6 Reconsideration of Committee decision.

(a) The Committee may reconsider its decision to add items to the Procurement List if it receives pertinent information which was not before it when it initially made the decision. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, requests for reconsideration from interested persons must be received by the Committee within 60 days following the effective date of the addition in question. A request for reconsideration must include the specific facts believed by the interested person to justify a decision by the Committee to modify or reverse its earlier action.

(b) In reconsidering its decision, the Committee will balance the harm to the party requesting reconsideration if the item remains on the Procurement List against the harm which the nonprofit agency or its employees who are blind or have other severe disabilities would suffer if the item were deleted from the Procurement List. The Committee may also consider information bringing into question its conclusions on the suitability criteria on which it based its original decision as factors weighing toward a decision to delete the item, and information concerning possible harm to the Government and the JWOD Program as factors weighing toward confirmation of the original decision.

##### § 51-2.7 Fair market price.

(a) The Committee is responsible for determining fair market prices, and changes thereto, for commodities and services on the Procurement List. The Committee establishes an initial fair market price at the time a commodity or service is added to the Procurement List. This initial price is based on Committee procedures, which permit negotiations between the contracting activity and the nonprofit agency which will produce or provide the commodity or service to the Government, assisted by the appropriate central nonprofit agency. If agreed to by the negotiating parties, the initial price may be developed using other methodologies specified in Committee pricing procedures.

(b) Prices are revised in accordance with changing market conditions under Committee procedures, which include negotiations between contracting activities and producing nonprofit agencies, assisted by central nonprofit agencies, or the use of economic indices, changes in nonprofit agency costs, or other methodologies permitted under these procedures.

(c) Recommendations for initial fair market prices, or changes thereto, shall be submitted jointly by the contracting activities and nonprofit agencies concerned to the appropriate central nonprofit agency. After review and analysis, the central nonprofit agency shall submit the recommended prices and methods by which prices shall be changed to the Committee, along with the information required by Committee pricing procedures to support each recommendation. The Committee will review the recommendations, revise the recommended prices where appropriate, and establish a fair market price, or change thereto, for each commodity or service which is the subject of a recommendation.

##### § 51-2.8 Procurement list.

(a) The Committee maintains a Procurement List which includes the commodities and services which shall be procured by Government departments and agencies under the JWOD Act from the nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee. Copies of the Procurement List, together with information on procurement requirements and procedures, are available to contracting activities upon request.

(b) For commodities, including military resale commodities, the Procurement List identifies the name and national stock number or item designation for each commodity, and where appropriate, any limitation on the portion of the commodity which must be procured under the JWOD Act.

(c) For services, the Procurement List identifies the type of service to be furnished, the Government department or agency responsible for procuring the service, and, where appropriate, the activity or item to be serviced.

(d) Additions to and deletions from the Procurement List are published in theas they are approved by the Committee.

##### § 51-2.9 Oral presentations by interested persons at Committee meetings.

(a) Upon written request from an interested person, that person may, at the discretion of the Committee Chair, be permitted to appear before the Committee to present views orally. Generally, only those persons who have raised significant issues which, if valid, could influence the Committee's decision in the matter under consideration will be permitted to appear.

(b) When the Chair has approved the appearance before the Committee of an interested person who has made a written request:

(1) The name of the spokesperson and the names of any other persons planning to appear shall be provided to the Committee staff by telephone at least three working days before the meeting.

(a) Contracting activities are encouraged to assist the Committee and the central nonprofit agencies in identifying suitable commodities and services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities so that the Committee can attain its objective of increasing employment and training opportunities for individuals who are blind or have other severe disabilities. For items which appear to be suitable to be furnished by nonprofit agencies, the contracting activity should refer the candidate commodities and services to the Committee or a central nonprofit agency. If a contracting activity decides to procure one or more commodities which are similar to a commodity or commodities on the Procurement List, the contracting activity should refer the commodities it intends to procure to the Committee or a central nonprofit agency.

(b) Contracting activities shall provide the Committee and designated central nonprofit agencies with information needed to enable the Committee to determine whether a commodity or service is suitable to be furnished by a nonprofit agency. For commodities, information such as the latest solicitation and amendments, bid abstracts, procurement history, estimated annual usage quantities, and anticipated date of next solicitation issuance and opening may be needed. For services, similar information including the statement of work and applicable wage determination may be required. In order to assist in evaluating the suitability of an Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A&#x2013;76 conversion, contracting activities should provide a copy of the draft statement of work and applicable wage determination to the central nonprofit agency upon its request.

##### § 51-5.2 Mandatory source requirement.

(a) Nonprofit agencies designated by the Committee are mandatory sources of supply for all entities of the Government for commodities and services included on the Procurement List, as provided in § 51&#x2013;1.2 of this chapter.

(b) Purchases of commodities on the Procurement List by entities of the Government shall be made from sources authorized by the Committee. These sources may include nonprofit agencies, central nonprofit agencies, Government central supply agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency and the General Services Administration, and certain commercial distributors. Identification of the authorized sources for a particular commodity may be obtained from the central nonprofit agencies at the addresses noted in § 51&#x2013;6.2 of this chapter.

(c) Contracting activities shall require other persons providing commodities which are on the Procurement List to entities of the Government by contract to order these commodities from the sources authorized by the Committee.

(d) Procedures for obtaining military resale commodities are contained in § 51&#x2013;6.4 of this chapter.

(e) Contracting activities procuring services which have included within them services on the Procurement List shall require their contractors for the larger service requirement to procure the included Procurement List services from nonprofit agencies designated by the Committee.

##### § 51-5.3 Scope of requirement.

(a) When a commodity is included on the Procurement List, the mandatory source requirement covers the National Stock Number or item designation listed and commodities that are essentially the same as the listed item. In some instances, only a portion of the Government requirement for a National Stock Number or item designation is specified by the Procurement List. Where geographic areas, quantities, percentages or specific supply locations for a commodity are listed, the mandatory provisions of the JWOD Act apply only to the portion or portions of the commodity indicated by the Procurement List.

(b) For services, where an agency and location or geographic area are listed on the Procurement List, only the service for the location or geographic area listed must be procured from the nonprofit agency, except as provided in § 51&#x2013;6.14 of this chapter. Where no location or geographic area is indicated by the Procurement List, it is mandatory that the total Government requirement for that service be procured from a nonprofit agency.

(c) When a commodity or service is added to the Procurement List, the addition does not affect contracts for the commodity or service awarded prior to the effective date of the Procurement List addition or options exercised under those contracts.

##### § 51-5.4 Purchase exceptions.

(a) A central nonprofit agency will normally grant a purchase exception for a contracting activity to procure from commercial sources commodities or services on the Procurement List when both of the following conditions are met:

(1) The central nonprofit agency or its nonprofit agency(ies) cannot furnish a commodity or service within the period specified, and

(2) The commodity or service is available from commercial sources in the quantities needed and significantly sooner than it will be available from the nonprofit agency(ies).

(b) The central nonprofit agency may grant a purchase exception when the quantity involved is not sufficient to be furnished economically by the nonprofit agency(ies).

(c) The Committee may also grant a purchase exception for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) The central nonprofit agency shall obtain the approval of the Committee before granting a purchase exception when the value of the procurement exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold set forth in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 or any subsequent amendments thereto.

(e) When the central nonprofit agency grants a purchase exception under the above conditions, it shall do so promptly and shall specify the quantities and delivery period covered by the exception.

(f) When a purchase exception is granted under paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) Contracting activities shall initiate purchase actions within 15 days following the date of the purchase exception. The deadline may be extended by the central nonprofit agency with, in cases of procurements exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the concurrence of the Committee.

(2) Contracting activities shall furnish a copy to the solicitation to the appropriate central nonprofit agency at the time it is issued, and a copy of the annotated bid abstract upon awarding of the commercial contract.

(g) Any decision by a central nonprofit agency regarding a purchase exception may be appealed to the Committee by the contracting activity.

##### § 51-5.5 Prices.

(a) The prices for items on the Procurement List are fair market prices established by the Committee under authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47(b)).

(b) Prices for commodities include applicable packaging, packing, and marking. Prices include transportation to point of delivery as specified in § 51&#x2013;5.6.

(c) Price changes for commodities and services shall usually apply to orders received by the nonprofit agency on or after the effective date of the change. In special cases, after considering the views of the contracting activity, the Committee may make price changes applicable to orders received by the nonprofit agency prior to the effective date of the change.

(d) To assist the Committee in revising the fair market prices for services on the Procurement List, upon request from the central nonprofit agency, the contracting activity should take the following actions:

(1) Submit to the Department of Labor in a timely fashion a request for wage determination rate.

(2) Provide a copy of the new wage determination rate or the Department of Labor document stating that the wage determination rate is unchanged to the central nonprofit agency at least 60 days before the beginning of the new service period.

(3) Provide to the central nonprofit agency at least 90 days before the beginning of the new service period a copy of the statement of work applicable to the new service period.

(e) If a contracting activity desires packing, packaging, or marking of products other than the standard pack or as provided in the Procurement List, any difference in cost shall be negotiated with the nonprofit agency.

##### § 51-5.6 Shipping.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, commodities are sold to the Government on an “F.O.B. destination” basis, with delivery being accomplished when the shipment reaches the facility designated by the contracting activity. Time of delivery is when the shipment is released by the carrier and accepted by the contracting activity or its agent. In this delivery method, the nonprofit agency will normally use commercial bills of lading and will be responsible for any loss or damage to the goods occurring before the commodities reach the designated delivery point. The nonprofit agency will prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading, furnish delivery schedules, designate the carriers, and pay all shipping charges to specified delivery points.

(b) The Committee may determine that certain commodities are to be sold to the Government on an “F.O.B. origin” basis, with delivery being accomplished when a shipment is placed aboard the vehicle of the initial carrier. Time of delivery is when the shipment is released to and accepted by the initial carrier. In this delivery method, the nonprofit agency will normally use Government bills of lading, and responsibility for loss or damage to the goods while in transit passes to the Government at the time the initial carrier accepts a shipment. If the contracting activity fails to furnish a Government bill of lading promptly, such failure shall be considered an excusable delay in delivery.

##### § 51-5.7 Payments.

Payments for products or services of persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be made within 30 days after shipment or receipt of a proper invoice or voucher.

##### § 51-5.8 Violations by entities of the Government.

Any alleged violations of the JWOD Act or these regulations by entities of the Government shall be investigated by the Committee, which shall notify the entity and afford it an opportunity to submit a statement.

#### PART 51-6 - PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES

##### § 51-6.1 Direct order process.

(a) Once a commodity or service is added to the Procurement List, the central nonprofit agency may authorize the contracting activity to issue orders directly to a nonprofit agency without requesting an allocation for each order. This procedure is known as the direct order process.

(b) In these cases, the central nonprofit agency shall specify the normal leadtime required for orders transmitted directly to the nonprofit agencies. This method shall be used whenever possible since it eliminates double handling and decreases the time required for processing orders.

(c) An order for commodities or services shall provide leadtime sufficient for purchase of materials, production or preparation, and delivery or completion.

(d) The central nonprofit agency shall keep the contracting activity informed of any changes in leadtime experienced by its nonprofit agencies in order to keep to a minimum requests for extensions once an order is placed. Where, due to unusual conditions, an order does not provide sufficient leadtime, the central nonprofit agency or the individual nonprofit agency may request an extension of delivery or completion date which should be granted, if feasible. If extension of delivery or completion date is not feasible, the contracting activity shall:

(1) Notify the central nonprofit agency and the individual nonprofit agency(ies) as appropriate.

(2) Request the central nonprofit agency to reallocate or to issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51&#x2013;5.4 of this chapter.

(e) The contracting activity shall promptly provide to the central nonprofit agency concerned a copy of all orders issued to nonprofit agencies.

(f) The written direct order authorization remains valid until it is revoked by the central nonprofit agency.

##### § 51-6.2 Allocation process.

(a) In those cases where a direct order authorization has not been issued as described in § 51&#x2013;6.1, the contracting activity shall submit written requests for allocation to the appropriate central nonprofit agency indicated by the Procurement List at the address listed below:

(b) Requests for allocations shall contain, as a minimum:

(1) For commodities. Name, stock number, latest specification, quantity, unit price, and place and time of delivery.

(2) For services. Type and location of service required, latest specification, work to be performed, estimated volume, and time for completion.

(c) Contracting activities shall request allocations in sufficient time for the central nonprofit agency to reply, for the order(s) to be placed, and for the nonprofit agencies to furnish the commodity or service (see paragraph (i) of this section).

(d) When a commodity on the Procurement List also appears on the Federal Prison Industries' “Schedule of Products,” the contracting activity shall obtain clearance from the Federal Prison Industries prior to requesting an allocation or placing an order directly to the nonprofit agency(ies).

(e) The central nonprofit agency shall make allocations to the appropriate nonprofit agency(ies) upon receipt of a request from the contracting activity and instruct that the orders be forwarded to the central nonprofit agency or direct to the nonprofit agency(ies) with a copy provided promptly to the central nonprofit agency.

(f) Central nonprofit agencies shall reply promptly to requests for allocation. When a request for allocation provides a delivery schedule (based on established lead times and time required for processing the allocation request) which cannot be met, the central nonprofit agency shall request a revision, which the contracting activity shall grant, if feasible, or the central nonprofit agency shall issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51&#x2013;5.4 of this chapter.

(g) An allocation is not an obligation to supply a commodity or service, or an obligation for the contracting activity to issue an order. Nonprofit agencies are not authorized to commence production until receipt of an order.

(h) Upon receipt of an allocation, the contracting activity shall promptly submit an order to the appropriate central nonprofit agency or designated nonprofit agency(ies). Where this cannot be done promptly, the contracting activity shall advise the central nonprofit agency and the nonprofit agency(ies) immediately.

(i) An order for commodities or services shall provide leadtime sufficient for purchase of materials, production or preparation, and delivery or completion.

(j) The Central nonprofit agency shall keep the contracting activity informed of any changes in leadtime experienced by its nonprofit agency(ies) in order to keep to a minimum requests for extensions once an order is placed. Where, due to unusual conditions, an order does not provide sufficient leadtime, the central nonprofit agency or nonprofit agency may request an extension of delivery or completion date which should be granted, if feasible. If extension of delivery or completion date is not feasible, the contracting activity shall:

(1) Notify the central nonprofit agency and nonprofit agency(ies) as appropriate.

(2) Request the central nonprofit agency to reallocate or to issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51&#x2013;5.4 of this chapter.

(k) In those instances where the central nonprofit agency is the prime contractor rather than the nonprofit agency, the central nonprofit agency will designate the nonprofit agency(ies) authorized by the Committee to furnish definite quantities of commodities or specific services upon receipt of an order from the contracting activity.

##### § 51-6.3 Long-term procurements.

(a) Contracting activities are encouraged to investigate long-term ordering agreements for commodities listed on the Procurement List to level off demand, thereby helping ensure stability of employment and development of job skills for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

(b) Contracting activities are encouraged to use the longest contract term available by law to their agencies for contracts for commodities and services under the AbilityOne Program, in order to minimize the time and expense devoted to formation and renewal of these contracts.

##### § 51-6.4 Military resale commodities.

(a) Purchase procedures for ordering military resale commodities are available from the central nonprofit agencies. Authorized resale outlets (military commissary stores, Armed Forces exchanges and like activities of other Government departments and agencies) shall request the central nonprofit agency responsible for the military resale commodity being ordered to designate the nonprofit agency or its agent to which the outlets shall forward orders.

(b) Authorized resale outlets shall stock military resale commodities in as broad a range as practicable. Authorized resale outlets may stock commercial items comparable to military resale commodities they stock, except that military commissary stores shall stock military resale commodities in the 300&#x2013;800&#x2013;, 900&#x2013;, 1000&#x2013;, 1100&#x2013;, 10000&#x2013; (10000&#x2013;10999); 13000 (13000&#x2013;13999); 14000 (14000&#x2013;14999); 15000 (15000&#x2013;15999); and 16000 (16000&#x2013;16999) series exclusively, unless an exception has been granted on an individual store basis for the stocking of comparable commercial items for which there is a significant customer demand.

(c) The Defense Commissary Agency shall, after consultation with the Committee:

(1) Establish mandatory lists of military resale commodities to be stocked in commissary stores.

(2) Require the stocking in commissary stores of military resale commodities in the 0&#x2013; (0&#x2013;99), 200&#x2013;, 300&#x2013;, 400&#x2013;, 500&#x2013;, 600&#x2013;, 700&#x2013;, 800&#x2013;, 900&#x2013;, 1000&#x2013;, 1100&#x2013;, 1200&#x2013; (1200&#x2013;9999), 10000&#x2013; (10000&#x2013;10999), 11000 (11000&#x2013;11999); 12000 (12000&#x2013;12999); 13000 (13000&#x2013;13999); 14000 (14000&#x2013;14999); 15000 (15000&#x2013;15999); and 16000 (16000&#x2013;16999) series in as broad a range as is practicable.

(3) Issue guidance requiring commissary store personnel to maximize sales potential of military resale commodities.

(4) Establish policies and procedures which reserve to its agency headquarters the authority to grant exceptions to the exclusive stocking of 300&#x2013;, 800&#x2013;, 900&#x2013;, 1000&#x2013;, 1100&#x2013;, 10000&#x2013; (10000&#x2013;10999); 13000 (13000&#x2013;13999); 14000 (14000&#x2013;14999); 15000 (15000&#x2013;15999); and 16000 (16000&#x2013;16999) series military resale commodities.

(d) The Defense Commissary Agency shall provide the Committee a copy of each directive which relates to the stocking of military resale commodities in commissary stores, including exceptions authorizing the stocking of commercial items in competition with 300&#x2013;, 800&#x2013;, 900&#x2013;, 1000&#x2013;, 1100&#x2013;, 10000&#x2013; (10000&#x2013;10999); 13000 (13000&#x2013;13999); 14000 (14000&#x2013;14999); 15000 (15000&#x2013;15999); and 16000 (16000&#x2013;16999) series military resale commodities.

(e) The prices of military resale commodities include delivery to destination or, in the case of destinations overseas, to designated depots at ports of embarkation. Zone pricing is used for delivery to Alaska and Hawaii.

##### § 51-6.5 Adjustment and cancellation of orders.

When the central nonprofit agency or an individual nonprofit agency fails to comply with the terms of a Government order, the contracting activity shall make every effort to negotiate an adjustment before taking action to cancel the order. When a Government order is canceled for failure to comply with its terms, the central nonprofit agency shall be notified, and, if practicable, requested to reallocate the order. The central nonprofit agency shall notify the Committee of any cancellation of an order and the reasons for that cancellation.

##### § 51-6.6 Request for waiver of specification requirement.

(a) Nonprofit agencies and central nonprofit agencies are encouraged to recommend changes to specification requirements or request waivers where there are opportunities to provide equal or improved products at a lower cost to the Government.

(b) A nonprofit agency shall not request a waiver of a specification requirement except when it is not possible to obtain the material meeting the specification or when other requirements contained in the specification cannot be met.

(c) Requests for waiver of specification shall be transmitted by the nonprofit agency to its central nonprofit agency.

(d) The central nonprofit agency shall review the request and the specification to determine if the request is valid and shall submit to the contracting activity only those requests which it has determined are necessary to enable the nonprofit agency to furnish the item.

(e) The central nonprofit agency request for waiver shall be transmitted in writing to the contracting activity. In addition, a copy of the request shall be transmitted to the Committee, annotated to include a statement concerning the impact on the cost of producing the item if the waiver is approved.

##### § 51-6.7 Orders in excess of nonprofit agency capability.

(a) Nonprofit agencies are expected to furnish commodities on the Procurement List within the time frames specified by the Government. The nonprofit agency must have the necessary production facilities to meet normal fluctuations in demand.

(b) Nonprofit agencies shall take those actions necessary to ensure that they can ship commodities within the time frames specified by the Government. In instances where the nonprofit agency determines that it cannot ship the commodity in the quantities specified by the required shipping date, it shall notify the central nonprofit agency and the contracting activity. The central nonprofit agency shall request a revision of the shipping schedule which the contracting activity should grant, if feasible, or the central nonprofit agency shall issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51&#x2013;5.4 of this chapter.

##### § 51-6.8 Deletion of items from the Procurement List.

(a) When a central nonprofit agency decides to request that the Committee delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List, it shall notify the Committee staff immediately. Before reaching a decision to request a deletion of an item from the Procurement List, the central nonprofit agency shall determine that none of its nonprofit agencies is capable and desirous of furnishing the commodity or service involved.

(b) Except in cases where the Government is no longer procuring the item in question, the Committee shall, prior to deleting an item from the Procurement List, determine that none of the nonprofit agencies of the other central nonprofit agency is desirous and capable of furnishing the commodity or service involved.

(c) Nonprofit agencies will normally be required to complete production of any orders for commodities on hand regardless of the decision to delete the item. Nonprofit agencies shall obtain concurrence of the contracting activity and the Committee prior to returning a purchase order to the contracting activity.

(d) For services, a nonprofit agency shall notify the contracting activity of its intent to discontinue performance of the service 90 days in advance of the termination date to enable the contracting activity to assure continuity of the service after the nonprofit agency's discontinuance.

(e) The Committee may delete an item from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit agency if the Committee determines that none of the nonprofit agencies participating in the AbilityOne Program are capable and desirous of furnishing the commodity or service to the Government, or if the Committee decides that the commodity or service is no longer suitable for procurement from nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities. In considering such an action, the Committee will consult with the appropriate central nonprofit agency, the nonprofit agency or agencies involved, and the contracting activity.

##### § 51-6.9 Correspondence and inquiries.

Routine contracting activity correspondence or inquiries concerning deliveries of commodities being shipped from or performance of services by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be with the nonprofit agency involved. Major problems shall be referred to the appropriate central nonprofit agency. In those instances where the problem cannot be resolved by the central nonprofit agency and the contracting activity involved, the contracting activity or central nonprofit agency shall notify the Committee of the problem so that action can be taken by the Committee to resolve it.

##### § 51-6.10 Quality of merchandise.

(a) Commodities furnished under Government specification by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be manufactured in strict compliance with such specifications. Where no specifications exist, commodities furnished shall be of a quality equal to or higher than similar items available on the commercial market. Commodities shall be inspected utilizing nationally recognized test methods and procedures for sampling and inspection.

(b) Services furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be performed in accordance with Government specifications and standards. Where no Government specifications and standards exist, the services shall be performed in accordance with commercial practices.

##### § 51-6.11 Quality complaints.

(a) When the quality of a commodity received is not considered satisfactory by the using activity, the activity shall take the following actions as appropriate:

(1) For commodities received from Defense Logistics Agency supply centers, General Services Administration supply distribution facilities, Department of Veterans Affairs distribution division or other central stockage depots, or specifically authorized supply source, notify the supplying agency in writing in accordance with that agency's procedures. The supplying agency shall, in turn, provide copies of the notice to the nonprofit agency involved and its central nonprofit agency.

(2) For commodities received directly from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, address complaints to the nonprofit agency involved with a copy to the central nonprofit agency with which it is affiliated.

(b) When the quality of a service is not considered satisfactory by the contracting activity, it shall address complaints to the nonprofit agency involved with a copy to the central nonprofit agency with which it is affiliated.

##### § 51-6.12 Specification changes and similar actions.

(a) Contracting activities shall notify the nonprofit agency or agencies authorized to furnish a commodity on the Procurement List and the central nonprofit agency concerned of any changes to the specification or other description of the commodity.

(b) When a Government entity is changing the specification or description of a commodity on the Procurement List, including a change that involves the assignment of a new national stock number or item designation, the office assigned responsibility for the action shall obtain the comments of the Committee and the central nonprofit agency concerned on the proposed change and shall notify the nonprofit agency and the central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to placing an order for a commodity covered by the new specification or description.

(c) For services on the Procurement List, the contracting activity shall notify the nonprofit agency furnishing the service and the central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to the date that any changes in the statement of work or other conditions of performance will be required, including assumption of performance of the service by the contracting activity.

(d) If an emergency makes it impossible for a contracting activity to give the 90-day notice required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the contracting activity shall inform the nonprofit agency and the central nonprofit agency concerned of the reasons it cannot meet the 90-day notice requirement when it places the order or change notice.

(e) Nonprofit agencies shall recommend changes in specifications, item descriptions, and statements of work that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve overall value to the Government. Contracting activities shall respond promptly to these recommendations and work with the nonprofit agencies to implement them when appropriate.

##### § 51-6.13 Replacement and similar commodities.

(a) When a commodity on the Procurement List is replaced by another commodity which has not been recently procured, and a nonprofit agency can furnish the replacement commodity in accordance with the Government's quality standards and delivery schedules, the replacement commodity is automatically considered to be on the Procurement List and shall be procured from the nonprofit agency designated by the Committee at the fair market price the Committee has set for the replacement commodity. The commodity being replaced shall continue to be included on the Procurement List until there is no longer a Government requirement for that commodity.

(b) If contracting activities desire to procure additional sizes, colors, or other variations of a commodity after the commodity is added to the Procurement List, and these similar commodities have not recently been procured, these commodities are also automatically considered to be on the Procurement List.

(c) In accordance with § 51&#x2013;5.3 of this chapter, contracting activities are not permitted to purchase commercial items that are essentially the same as commodities on the Procurement List.

##### § 51-6.14 Replacement services.

If a service is on the Procurement List to meet the needs of a Government entity at a specific location and the entity moves to another location, the service at the new location is automatically considered to be on the Procurement List if a qualified nonprofit agency is available to provide the service at the new location, unless the service at that location is already being provided by another contractor. If the service at the new location is being provided by another contractor, the service will not be on the Procurement List unless the Committee adds it as prescribed in part 51&#x2013;2 of this chapter. If another Government entity moves into the old location, the service at that location will remain on the Procurement List to meet the needs of the new Government entity.

##### § 51-6.15 Disputes.

Disputes between a nonprofit agency and a contracting activity arising out of matters covered by parts 51&#x2013;5 and 51&#x2013;6 of this chapter shall be resolved, where possible, by the contracting activity and the nonprofit agency, with assistance from the appropriate central nonprofit agency. Disputes which cannot be resolved by these parties shall be referred to the Committee for resolution.

#### PART 51-7 - PROCEDURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

##### § 51-7.1 Purpose and scope.

(a)This part implements the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and provides for the implementation of those provisions identified in 40 CFR 1507.3(b) of the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR parts 1500&#x2013;1508) published pursuant to NEPA.

(b)This part applies to all actions of the Committee for Purchase from Persons who are Blind or Severely Disabled which may affect environmental quality in the United States.

##### § 51-7.2 Early involvement in private, State, and local activities requiring Federal approval.

(a) 40 CFR 1501.2(d) requires agencies to provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some sort of Federal approval. Pursuant to the JWOD Act (41 U.S.C. 46&#x2013;48c), the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled makes the determination as to which qualified nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities will furnish designated products and services to the Government.

(b) To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect to these actions, the Committee staff shall consult as required with other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary environmental analysis. The Executive Director shall determine on the basis of information submitted by private agencies and other non-Federal entities or generated by the Committee whether the proposed action is one that normally does not require an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement (EIS) as set forth in § 51&#x2013;7.4, or is one that requires an environmental assessment as set forth in 40 CFR 1501.4.

(c) To facilitate compliance with these requirements, private agencies and other non-Federal entities are expected to:

(1) Contact the Committee staff as early as possible in the planning process for guidance on the scope and level of environmental information required to be submitted in support of their request;

(2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate by the Committee to determine the impact of the proposed action on the human environment;

(3) Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;

(4) Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local approvals as early as possible in the planning process;

(5) Notify the Committee as early as possible of all other Federal, regional, State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project completion so that the Committee may coordinate all Federal environmental reviews; and

(6) Notify the Committee of all known parties potentially affected by or interested in the proposed action.

##### § 51-7.3 Ensuring environmental documents are actually considered in agency determinations.

(a) 40 CFR 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decision-making. To implement these requirements, the Committee staff shall:

(1) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for agency action;

(2) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the proposal through the agency review processes;

(3) Consider only those alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating proposals for agency action; and

(4) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific alternative analysis in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.

(b) For each of the Committee's actions authorized by the JWOD Act, the following list identifies the point at which the NEPA process begins, the point at which it ends, and the key agency official or office required to consider the relevant environmental documents as a part of their decision-making:

(1) Action: Request.

(2) Start of NEPA process: Upon receipt of request.

(3) Completion of NEPA process: When the deciding official reviews the proposal and makes a determination.

(4) Key official or office required to consider environmental document: When a positive determination is made under § 51&#x2013;7.2(b), the applicant in conjunction with the Committee staff will prepare the necessary papers.

##### § 51-7.4 Typical classes of action.

(a) 40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2) in conjunction with 40 CFR 1508.4 requires agencies to establish three typical classes of action for similar treatment under NEPA. These typical classes of action are set forth below:

(1) Actions normally requiring EIS: None.

(2) Actions normally requiring assessments but not necessarily EISs: Requests for actions for which determinations under § 51&#x2013;7.2(b) are found to be affirmative.

(3) Actions normally not requiring assessments or EISs: Request for actions by nonprofit agencies through the central nonprofit agencies to add a commodity or service to the Committee's Procurement List.

(b) The Committee shall independently determine, by referring to 40 CFR 1508.27, whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:

(1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action above; or

(2) For actions which are covered, but where the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.

##### § 51-7.5 Environmental information.

Interested parties may contact the Executive Director at (703) 603&#x2013;7740 for information regarding the Committee's compliance with NEPA.

#### PART 51-8 - PUBLIC AVAILABILTY OF AGENCY MATERIALS

##### § 51-8.1 General.

(a) This part contains the rules that the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under part 51&#x2013;9 as well as under this part. As a matter of policy, the Committee makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.

(b) The Committee has a centralized system for processing requests, all requests are handled by the FOIA Officer.

##### § 51-8.2 Proactive Disclosures.

Records that the Committee is required to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Committee's public website:. The Committee is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Committee shall ensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. The Committee's FOIA Public Liaison contact information is available at.

##### § 51-8.3 Requirements for Making Requests.

(a)(1) The Committee has designated a FOIA office to process and respond to all FOIA requests. All Committee departments have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office.

(2) A requester may submit a request for records to the Executive Director at the Committee's offices, 1401 S Clark Street, Suite 715, Arlington, Virginia 22202&#x2013;3259, or via email toor via facsimile to (703) 603&#x2013;0655. The request must be in writing and should indicate that it is being made under the FOIA. Failure to submit a request in accordance with these procedures may delay the processing of the request.

(3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in part 51&#x2013;9.

(4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual has deceased (a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Committee can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

(b)Requesters must describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable Committee personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA office determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA office shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.

(c) If the Committee determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and extend to the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to confer promptly with knowledgeable Committee personnel to attempt to identify the records being sought or to reformulate a request. The Committee may offer assistance in identifying records and reformulating a request where: The description is deemed insufficient, the production of voluminous records is required, or a considerable number of work hours would be required to complete the request that would interfere with the business of the Committee.

##### § 51-8.4 Responsibility for Responding to Requests.

(a)Except in the instances described in paragraphs (c) of this section, the Committee is responsible for responding to a record request it received. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Committee ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Committee shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request. The Committee has no obligation to create a record solely for the purpose of making it available under the FOIA.

(b)The Executive Director, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for records that are maintained by the Committee.

(c)When reviewing records located by the Committee in response to a request, the Committee shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Committee shall proceed in one of the following ways:

(1)When records originated with the Committee processing the request, but contain information of interest to another agency, or other Federal Government office, the Committee should typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.

(2)(i) When upon the receipt of the request the Committee determines that a different agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Committee should refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the other agency, as long as that agency is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Committee processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever the Committee refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

(3)The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if the Committee responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publically known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Committee locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Committee, upon receipt of the request, should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the Committee.

(d)Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the Committee shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (when it contains information classified by another agency), the Committee shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.

(e)All consultations and referrals received by the Committee will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request was received by the first agency.

(f)The Committee may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

##### § 51-8.5 Timing of Responses to Requests.

(a)(1) The Committee ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. The time limits prescribed in the FOIA will begin only after the Committee identifies a request as being made under the FOIA and deemed received by the Committee.

(2) An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant each request for records or a fee waiver shall be made within 10 business days after receipt of that request. The requester shall be notified as soon as the determination is made.

(3) When a requester complies with the procedures established in this part for obtaining records under the FOIA, the request shall receive prompt attention, and a response will be made within 20 business days.

(b)Whenever the Committee cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Committee extends the time limit on that basis, the Committee shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Committee will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Committee shall make available its FOIA office and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The agency must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services.

(c)For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Committee may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Committee shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

(d)(1) The Committee may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple, complex, and expedited requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process a request or the number of pages involved. Expedited processing shall be in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Among the factors a component may consider are the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Committee shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

(e)(1) Requests and appeals may be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:

(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;

(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.

(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section must be submitted to the Committee's FOIA office.

(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request&#x2014;one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Committee may waive the formal certification requirement.

(4) The Committee shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.

##### § 51-8.6 Responses to Requests.

(a)The Committee should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.

(b)The Committee shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Committee shall include in the acknowledgement a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

(c)When the Committee makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The Committee shall inform the requester of any fees charged under subpart 51&#x2013;8.10 of this part and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Committee must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

(d)If the Committee makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, the requester will be notified in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.

(e)The denial will be signed by the Executive Director or designee and include:

(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;

(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied in denying the request;

(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart 51&#x2013;8.8 of this part, and a description of the appeal requirements set forth therein; and

(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Committee's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).

##### § 51-8.7 Confidential Commercial Information.

(a)

(1)means commercial or financial information obtained by the Committee from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

(2)means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

(b)A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

(c)(1) The Committee will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the Committee determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) The Committee has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.

(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish notification.

(d)The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

(1) The Committee determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;

(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Committee shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and shall provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

(e)(1) The Committee will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Committee a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the Committee after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the Committee. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

(f)The Committee will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

(g)(1) Whenever the Committee decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Committee will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

(i) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

(ii) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

(iii) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice, and not less than 10 business days after the date of the notice submission.

(iv) A statement that the submitter must notify the Committee immediately if the submitter intends to seek injunctive relief.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2) of this section, even if the submitter fails to respond to Committee's notice specified in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever the Committee decides to disclose the commercial information, the Committee will provide the submitter written notice of disclosure, as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

(h)Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Committee will promptly notify the submitter.

(i)The Committee will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

##### § 51-8.8 Administrative Appeals.

(a)A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the Committee's Chief FOIA Officer. The contact information for the FOIA Officer is available at the Committee's website, at. Appeals can be submitted through email or the web portal accessible on the FOIA web page. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 51&#x2013;8.6(d). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the Committee's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

(b)(1) The Committee Executive Director or designee will act on behalf of the Committee on all appeals under this section.

(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Committee's Chief FOIA Officer shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with

(c)A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds a Committee determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a Committee's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The Committee will thereafter further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.

(d)Mediation is a voluntary process. If the Committee agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by the Office of Government Information Services, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

(e)Before seeking review by a court of a Committee's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

##### § 51-8.9 Preservation of Records.

The Committee will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to Title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. Records will not be destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the Act.

##### § 51-8.10 Fees.

(a)The Committee will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the Committee may contact a requester for additional information. The Committee shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Committee will ordinarily collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order payable to the United States Department of Treasury.

(b)For purposes of this section:

(1)is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Committee's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.

(2)are those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

(3)is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

(4)is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. The Committee may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and agencies will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

(5)is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.

(6)is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Committee shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.

(7)is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 51&#x2013;8.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

(8)is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

(c)In responding to FOIA requests, the Committee will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Committee should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

(1)(i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. The Committee will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Committee may properly charge for time spent searching even if responsive records are not located or if the Committee determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees shall be as follows: Professional&#x2014;$10.00; and clerical/administrative&#x2014;$4.75.

(iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

(2)Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Committee shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the Committee in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, agencies will provide one copy per request at the cost of 25&#xA2; per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Committee will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, agencies will charge the direct costs.

(3)The Committee will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,the review conducted by the Committee to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Committee's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

(d)(1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.

(2)(i) If the Committee fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

(ii) If the Committee has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and the Committee provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

(iii) If the Committee has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Committee may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. The Committee must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the Committee must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Committee may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, Committee shall provide without charge:

(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

(ii) The first two hours of search.

(5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.

(e)(1) When the Committee determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the requesting party will be notified of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless a written statement from the requester has been received indicating a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be readily estimated, the Committee shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

(2) If the Committee notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or, in the case of a noncommercial use, requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Committee is not required to accept payments in installments.

(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Committee estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Committee will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Committee will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

(4) The Committee will make available the FOIA Public Liaison or other personnel to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

(f)Although not required to provide special services, if the Committee chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

(g)The Committee may charge interest on any unpaid bill for processing FOIA requests starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest rates will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Committee.

(h)When the Committee reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Committee may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Committee may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Committee will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregating the requests is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

(i)(1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the Committee shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

(2) When the Committee determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Committee may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Committee may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Committee may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Committee begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Committee has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

(4) In cases in which the Committee requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Committee's fee determination, the request will be closed.

(j)The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Committee shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

(k)(1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

(2) The Committee will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section are satisfied:

(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about the Committee operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Committee ordinarily will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Committee will consider the following criteria:

(A) The Committee must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or for profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Committee must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Committee ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Committee and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time as long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

##### § 51-10.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

Except as otherwise provided in § 51&#x2013;10.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

##### § 51-10.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

(a)The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not&#x2014;

(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 51&#x2013;10.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

(2)In meeting the requirements of § 51&#x2013;10.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 51&#x2013;10.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include&#x2014;

(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

(c)The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written).

(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

##### § 51-10.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151&#x2013;4157), as established in 41 CFR 101&#x2013;19.600 to 101&#x2013;19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

##### §§ 51-10.152-51-10.159 [Reserved]

##### § 51-10.160 Communications.

(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 51&#x2013;10.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

The General Counsel in his or her sole discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to an appropriate demand or request. Among the relevant factors that the General Counsel may consider in making this decision are whether:

(a) The purposes of this part are met;

(b) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

(c) The Committee has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;

(e) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of the Committee or the United States;

(f) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;

(g) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose;

(h) Disclosure would violate a statute, Executive order or regulation;

(i) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, otherwise protected information, or would otherwise be inappropriate for release;

(j) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceedings, or compromise constitutional rights;

(k) Disclosure would result in the Committee appearing to favor one private litigant over another private litigant;

(l) Disclosure relates to documents that originate from another agency;

(m) A substantial Government interest is implicated;

(n) The demand or request is within the authority of the party making it;

(o) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Committee employee to serve as an expert witness for a private interest;

(p) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Committee employee to testify as to a matter of law; and/or

(q) The demand or request is sufficiently specific to be answered.

##### § 51-11.8 Processing demands or requests.

(c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of the Committee or the United States or for other good cause.

##### § 51-11.9 Final determination.

The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands and requests for production of official records and information or testimony. All final determinations are within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requester and the court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the demand or request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of a Committee employee.

##### § 51-11.10 Restrictions that apply to testimony.

(a) Conditions or restrictions may be imposed on the testimony of the Committee employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that they will seek to file the transcript of the testimony under seal and that it will be used or made available only in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript or testimony be provided to the Committee at the requester's expense.

(b) The Committee may offer the employee's written declaration in lieu of testimony.

(c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee shall not:

(1) Disclose confidential or privileged information;

(2) Testify as to any information outside the scope of the General Counsel's authorization (§ 51&#x2013;11.7); or

##### § 51-11.11 Restrictions that apply to released records.

(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure.

In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the Committee may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.

(b) If the General Counsel so determines, original Committee records may be presented for examination in response to a demand or request, but they are not to be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identity as official Committee records, and they are not to be marked or altered. In lieu of the original records, certified copies will be presented for evidentiary purposes.

##### § 51-11.12 Procedure when a decision is not made prior to the time a response is required.

##### § 51-11.13 Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

If the court or other competent authority fails to stay the demand, the employee upon whom the demand or request is made, unless otherwise advised by the General Counsel, will appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this part, state that the employee has not been authorized to provide the requested testimony or produce documents, and respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citingv.340 U.S. 462 (1951). A written response may be offered to a request, or to a demand, if permitted by the court or other competent authority.

##### § 51-11.14 Fees.

(a)The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to the Committee.

(b)Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the Committee in its Freedom of Information Act regulations at 41 CFR part 51&#x2013;8.

(c)Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, travel time and expenses, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.

(d)Witness fees for current Committee employees and any records certification fees shall be paid by check or money order presented to the Committee made payable to the United States Department of Treasury. Applicable fees for former Committee employees' testimony must be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.

(e)The Committee Records Manager may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. Certification requests require 45 calendar days for processing and a fee of $15.00 for each document certified.

(f)The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.

(g)Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.

##### § 51-11.15 Penalties.

(a) An employee who discloses official records or information or gives testimony relating to official information, except as expressly authorized by the Committee, or as ordered by a Federal court after the Committee has had the opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Additionally, former Committee employees are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 216.

(b) A current Committee employee who testifies or produces official records and information in violation of this part may be subject to disciplinary action.

#### PART 60-1 - OBLIGATIONS OF CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

##### Subpart A - Preliminary Matters; Equal Opportunity Clause; Compliance Reports

###### § 60-1.1 Purpose and application.

The purpose of the regulations in this part is to achieve the aims of parts II, III, and IV of Executive Order 11246 for the promotion and insuring of equal opportunity for all persons, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, employed or seeking employment with Government contractors or with contractors performing under federally assisted construction contracts. The regulations in this part apply to all contracting agencies of the Government and to contractors and subcontractors who perform under Government contracts, to the extent set forth in this part. The regulations in this part also apply to all agencies of the Government administering programs involving Federal financial assistance which may include a construction contract, and to all contractors and subcontractors performing under construction contracts which are related to any such programs. The procedures set forth in the regulations in this part govern all disputes relative to a contractor's compliance with his obligations under the equal opportunity clause regardless of whether or not his contract contains a “Disputes” clause. Failure of a contractor or applicant to comply with any provision of the regulations in this part shall be grounds for the imposition of any or all of the sanctions authorized by the order. The regulations in this part do not apply to any action taken to effect compliance with respect to employment practices subject to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The rights and remedies of the Government hereunder are not exclusive and do not affect rights and remedies provided elsewhere by law, regulation, or contract; neither do the regulations limit the exercise by the Secretary or Government agencies of powers not herein specifically set forth, but granted to them by the order.

###### § 60-1.2 Administrative responsibility.

The Director has been delegated authority and assigned responsibility for carrying out the responsibilities assigned to the Secretary under the Executive order. All correspondence regarding the order should be directed to the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.

###### § 60-1.3 Definitions.

means any department, agency and establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including any wholly owned Government corporation, which administers a program involving federally assisted construction contracts.

means an administrative law judge appointed as provided in 5 U.S.C. 3105 and subpart B of part 930 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (see 37 FR 16787) and qualified to preside at hearings under 5 U.S.C. 557.

means any contracting or any administering agency of the Government.

means an applicant for Federal assistance involving a construction contract, or other participant in a program involving a construction contract as determined by regulation of an administering agency. The term also includes such persons after they become recipients of such Federal assistance.

means any payments made to, or on behalf of, an employee or offered to an applicant as remuneration for employment, including but not limited to salary, wages, overtime pay, shift differentials, bonuses, commissions, vacation and holiday pay, allowances, insurance and other benefits, stock options and awards, profit sharing, and retirement.

means the amount and type of compensation provided to employees or offered to applicants, including, but not limited to, the desire of the contractor to attract and retain a particular employee for the value the employee is perceived to add to the contractor's profit or productivity; the availability of employees with like skills in the marketplace; market research about the worth of similar jobs in the relevant marketplace; job analysis, descriptions, and evaluations; salary and pay structures; salary surveys; labor union agreements; and contractor decisions, statements and policies related to setting or altering employee compensation.

means any one or combination of actions OFCCP may take to examine a Federal contractor or subcontractor's compliance with one or more of the requirements of Executive Order 11246.

means the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, demolition or repair of buildings, highways, or other changes or improvements to real property, including facilities providing utility services. The term also includes the supervision, inspection, and other onsite functions incidental to the actual construction.

means any Government contract or subcontract or any federally assisted construction contract or subcontract.

means any department, agency, establishment, or instrumentality in the executive branch of the Government, including any wholly owned Government corporation, which enters into contracts.

means, unless otherwise indicated, a prime contractor or subcontractor.

means the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) of the United States Department of Labor, or his or her designee.

means the contract provisions set forth in § 60&#x2013;1.4 (a) or (b), as appropriate.

&#x2014;(1)The termmeans the fundamental job duties of the employment position an individual holds.

(2) A job function may be considered essential if:

(i) The access to compensation information is necessary in order to perform that function or another routinely assigned business task; or

(ii) The function or duties of the position include protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, including compensation information.

(3) The application or interpretation of the “essential job functions” definition in this part is limited to the discrimination claims governed by Executive Order 13665 and its implementing regulations.

means any agreement or modification thereof between any applicant and a person for construction work which is paid for in whole or in part with funds obtained from the Government or borrowed on the credit of the Government pursuant to any Federal program involving a grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee, or undertaken pursuant to any Federal program involving such grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee, or any application or modification thereof approved by the Government for a grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee under which the applicant itself participates in the construction work.

means the government of the United States of America.

means any agreement or modification thereof between any contracting agency and any person for the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services. The term “personal property,” as used in this section, includes supplies, and contracts for the use of real property (such as lease arrangements), unless the contract for the use of real property itself constitutes real property (such as easements). The term “nonpersonal services” as used in this section includes, but is not limited to, the following services: Utilities, construction, transportation, research, insurance, and fund depository. The termdoes not include:

(1) Agreements in which the parties stand in the relationship of employer and employee; and

(2) Federally assisted construction contracts.

(1) Internet Applicant means any individual as to whom the following four criteria are satisfied:

(i) The individual submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies;

(ii) The contractor considers the individual for employment in a particular position;

(iii) The individual's expression of interest indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the position; and,

(iv) The individual at no point in the contractor's selection process prior to receiving an offer of employment from the contractor, removes himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicates that he or she is no longer interested in the position.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(i) of this definition, “submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies,” includes all expressions of interest, regardless of the means or manner in which the expression of interest is made, if the contractor considers expressions of interest made through the Internet or related electronic data technologies in the recruiting or selection processes for that particular position.

(i) Example A: Contractor A posts on its web site an opening for a Mechanical Engineer position and encourages potential applicants to complete an on-line profile if they are interested in being considered for that position. The web site also advises potential applicants that they can send a hard copy resume to the HR Manager with a cover letter identifying the position for which they would like to be considered. Because Contractor A considers both Internet and traditional expressions of interest for the Mechanical Engineer position, both the individuals who completed a personal profile and those who sent a paper resume and cover letter to Contractor A meet this part of the definition of Internet Applicant for this position.

(ii) Example B: Contractor B posts on its web site an opening for the Accountant II position and encourages potential applicants to complete an on-line profile if they are interested in being considered for that position. Contractor B also receives a large number of unsolicited paper resumes in the mail each year. Contractor B scans these paper resumes into an internal resume database that also includes all the on-line profiles that individuals completed for various jobs (including possibly for the Accountant II position) throughout the year. To find potential applicants for the Accountant II position, Contractor B searches the internal resume database for individuals who have the basic qualifications for the Accountant II position. Because Contractor B considers both Internet and traditional expressions of interest for the Accountant II position, both the individuals who completed a personal profile and those who sent a paper resume and cover letter to the employer meet this part of the definition of Internet Applicant for this position.

(iii) Example C: Contractor C advertises for Mechanics in a local newspaper and instructs interested candidates to mail their resumes to the employer's address. Walk-in applications also are permitted. Contractor C considers only paper resumes and application forms for the Mechanic position, therefore no individual meets this part of the definition of an Internet Applicant for this position.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition, “considers the individual for employment in a particular position,” means that the contractor assesses the substantive information provided in the expression of interest with respect to any qualifications involved with a particular position. A contractor may establish a protocol under which it refrains from considering expressions of interest that are not submitted in accordance with standard procedures the contractor establishes. Likewise, a contractor may establish a protocol under which it refrains from considering expressions of interest, such as unsolicited resumes, that are not submitted with respect to a particular position. If there are a large number of expressions of interest, the contractor does not “consider the individual for employment in a particular position” by using data management techniques that do not depend on assessment of qualifications, such as random sampling or absolute numerical limits, to reduce the number of expressions of interest to be considered, provided that the sample is appropriate in terms of the pool of those submitting expressions of interest.

(4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition, “basic qualifications” means qualifications&#x2014;

(i)(A) That the contractor advertises (e.g., posts on its web site a description of the job and the qualifications involved) to potential applicants that they must possess in order to be considered for the position, or

(B) For which the contractor establishes criteria in advance by making and maintaining a record of such qualifications for the position prior to considering any expression of interest for that particular position if the contractor does not advertise for the position but instead uses an alternative device to find individuals for consideration (e.g., through an external resume database), and

(ii) That meet all of the following three conditions:

(A) The qualifications must be noncomparative features of a job seeker. For example, a qualification of three years' experience in a particular position is a noncomparative qualification; a qualification that an individual have one of the top five number of years' experience among a pool of job seekers is a comparative qualification.

(B) The qualifications must be objective; they do not depend on the contractor's subjective judgment. For example, “a Bachelor's degree in Accounting” is objective, while “a technical degree from a good school” is not. A basic qualification is objective if a third-party, with the contractor's technical knowledge, would be able to evaluate whether the job seeker possesses the qualification without more information about the contractor's judgment.

(C) The qualifications must be relevant to performance of the particular position and enable the contractor to accomplish business-related goals.

(5) For purposes of paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition, a contractor may conclude that an individual has removed himself or herself from further consideration, or has otherwise indicated that he or she is no longer interested in the position for which the contractor has considered the individual, based on the individual's express statement that he or she is no longer interested in the position, or on the individual's passive demonstration of disinterest shown through repeated non-responsiveness to inquiries from the contractor about interest in the position. A contractor also may determine that an individual has removed himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicated that he or she is no longer interested in the position for which the contractor has considered the individual based on information the individual provided in the expression of interest, such as salary requirements or preferences as to type of work or location of work, provided that the contractor has a uniformly and consistently applied policy or procedure of not considering similarly situated job seekers. If a large number of individuals meet the basic qualifications for the position, a contractor may also use data management techniques, such as random sampling or absolute numerical limits, to limit the number of individuals who must be contacted to determine their interest in the position, provided that the sample is appropriate in terms of the pool of those meeting the basic qualifications.

as used herein shall include, where appropriate, female employees and prospective female employees.

means any alteration in the terms and conditions of a contract, including supplemental agreements, amendments, and extensions.

ormeans parts II, III, and IV of the Executive Order 11246 dated September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319), any Executive order amending such order, and any other Executive order superseding such order.

means any natural person, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, State or local government, and any agency, instrumentality, or subdivision of such a government.

means any person holding a contract and, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, any person who has held a contract subject to the order.

includes but is not limited to testimony, interview statements, and documents about biased statements, remarks, attitudes, or acts based upon membership in a protected class, particularly when made by a decision maker involved in the action under investigation; testimony, interview statements, and documents about individuals denied or given misleading or contradictory information about employment or compensation practices, in circumstances suggesting discriminatory treatment based on a protected characteristic; testimony, interview statements, and documents about the extent of discretion or subjectivity involved in making employment decisions, in conjunction with evidence suggesting the discretion or subjectivity has been used to discriminate based on a protected characteristic; or other anecdotal evidence relevant to determining a contractor's discriminatory or non-discriminatory intent, the business necessity (or lack thereof) of a challenged policy or practice, or whether the contractor has otherwise complied with its non-discrimination obligations. Qualitative evidence may not be based solely on subjective inferences or the mere fact of supervisory discretion in employment decisions. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) may also consider qualitative evidence in the form of a contractor's efforts to advance equal employment opportunity beyond mere compliance with legal obligations in determining whether intentional discrimination has occurred.

includes hypothesis testing, controlling for the major, measurable parameters, and variables used by the contractor (including, as appropriate, preferred qualifications, other demographic variables, test scores, geographic variables, performance evaluations, years of experience, quality of experience, years of service, quality and reputation of previous employers, years of education, years of training, quality and reputation of credentialing institutions,), related to the probability of outcomes occurring by chance and/or analyses reflecting statements concluding that a disparity in employment selection rates or rates of compensation is statistically significant by reference to any one of these statements:

(1) The disparity is two or more times larger than its standard error (a standard deviation of two or more);

(2) The Z statistic has a value greater than two; or

(3) The probability value is less than 0.05. It also includes numerical analysis of similarly situated individuals, small groups, or other characteristics, demographics or outcomes where hypothesis-testing techniques are not used.

means any person who refers workers to any contractor or subcontractor or who provides for employment by any contractor or subcontractor.

used in paragraph (4) of the equal opportunity clause means rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor or his designee issued pursuant to the order.

means the Secretary of Labor, U.S. Department of Labor, or his or her designee.

means the general physical location of any building, highway, or other change or improvement to real property which is undergoing construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, demolition, or repair and any temporary location or facility at which a contractor, subcontractor, or other participating party meets a demand or performs a function relating to the contract or subcontract.

(1) Subcontract means any agreement or arrangement between a contractor and any person (in which the parties do not stand in the relationship of an employer and an employee):

(i) For the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services which, in whole or in part, is necessary to the performance of any one or more contracts; or

(ii) Under which any portion of the contractor's obligation under any one or more contracts is performed, undertaken, or assumed; and

(2) Does not include an agreement between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(i) An agreement means a relationship between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(ii) A health care provider is a physician, hospital, or other individual or entity that furnishes health care services or supplies.

(iii) A health organization is a voluntary association, corporation, partnership, managed care support contractor, or other nongovernmental organization that is lawfully engaged in providing, paying for, insuring, or reimbursing the cost of health care services or supplies under group insurance policies or contracts, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, network agreements, health benefits plans duly sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization or association of organizations and health maintenance organizations, or other similar arrangements, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges or payments payable to the health organization.

means any person holding a subcontract and, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, any person who has held a subcontract subject to the order. The term “first-tier subcontractor” refers to a subcontractor holding a subcontract with a prime contractor.

as used herein, shall include the several States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island.

###### § 60-1.4 Equal opportunity clause.

(a)Except as otherwise provided, each contracting agency shall include the following equal opportunity clause contained in section 202 of the order in each of its Government contracts (and modifications thereof if not included in the original contract):

(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided, each administering agency shall require the inclusion of the following language as a condition of any grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee involving federally assisted construction which is not exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause:

(c)Each nonexempt prime contractor or subcontractor shall include the equal opportunity clause in each of its nonexempt subcontracts.

(d)The equal opportunity clause may be included by reference in all Government contracts and subcontracts, including Government bills of lading, transportation requests, contracts for deposit of Government funds, and contracts for issuing and paying U.S. savings bonds and notes, and such other contracts and subcontracts as the Director of OFCCP may designate.

(e)By operation of the order, the equal opportunity clause shall be considered to be a part of every contract and subcontract required by the order and the regulations in this part to include such a clause whether or not it is physically incorporated in such contracts and whether or not the contract between the agency and the contractor is written.

(f)Such necessary changes in language may be made in the equal opportunity clause as shall be appropriate to identify properly the parties and their undertakings.

###### § 60-1.5 Exemptions.

(a)&#x2014;(1)Contracts and subcontracts not exceeding $10,000, other than Government bills of lading, and other than contracts and subcontracts with depositories of Federal funds in any amount and with financial institutions which are issuing and paying agents for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes, are exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause. In determining the applicability of this exemption to any federally assisted construction contract, or subcontract thereunder, the amount of such contract or subcontract rather than the amount of the Federal financial assistance shall govern. No agency, contractor, or subcontractor shall procure supplies or services in a manner so as to avoid applicability of the equal opportunity clause:that where a contractor has contracts or subcontracts with the Government in any 12-month period which have an aggregate total value (or can reasonably be expected to have an aggregate total value) exceeding $10,000, the $10,000 or under exemption does not apply, and the contracts are subject to the order and the regulations issued pursuant thereto regardless of whether any single contract exceeds $10,000.

(2)With respect to contracts and subcontracts for indefinite quantities (including, but not limited to, open end contracts, requirement-type contracts, Federal Supply Schedule contracts, “call-type” contracts, and purchase notice agreements), the equal opportunity clause shall be included unless the purchaser has reason to believe that the amount to be ordered in any year under such contract will not exceed $10,000. The applicability of the equal opportunity clause shall be determined by the purchaser at the time of award for the first year, and annually thereafter for succeeding years, if any. Notwithstanding the above, the equal opportunity clause shall be applied to such contract whenever the amount of a single order exceeds $10,000. Once the equal opportunity clause is determined to be applicable, the contract shall continue to be subject to such clause for its duration, regardless of the amounts ordered, or reasonably expected to be ordered in any year.

(3)Contracts and subcontracts are exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause with regard to work performed outside the United States by employees who were not recruited within the United States.

(4)The requirements of the equal opportunity clause in any contract or subcontract with a State or local government (or any agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof) shall not be applicable to any agency, instrumentality or subdivision of such government which does not participate in work on or under the contract or subcontract. In addition, any agency, instrumentality or subdivision of such government, except for educational institutions and medical facilities, are exempt from the requirements of filing the annual compliance report provided for by § 60&#x2013;1.7(a)(1) and maintaining a written affirmative action compliance program prescribed by § 60&#x2013;1.40 and part 60&#x2013;2 of this chapter.

(5)Section 202 of Executive Order 11246, as amended, shall not apply to a Government contractor or subcontractor that is a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society, with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities. Such contractors and subcontractors are not exempted or excused from complying with the other requirements contained in this Order.

(6)It shall not be a violation of the equal opportunity clause for a school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution of learning to hire and employ employees of a particular religion if such school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution of learning is, in whole or in substantial part, owned, supported, controlled, or managed by a particular religion or by a particular religious corporation, association, or society, or if the curriculum of such school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution of learning is directed toward the propagation of a particular religion. The primary thrust of this provision is directed at religiously oriented church-related colleges and universities and should be so interpreted.

(7)It shall not be a violation of the equal opportunity clause for a construction or nonconstruction contractor to extend a publicly announced preference in employment to Indians living on or near an Indian reservation in connection with employment opportunities on or near an Indian reservation. The use of the word “near” would include all that area where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day. Contractors or subcontractors extending such a preference shall not, however, discriminate among Indians on the basis of religion, sex, or tribal affiliation, and the use of such a preference shall not excuse a contractor from complying with the other requirements contained in this chapter.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The Director may exempt an agency or any person from requiring the inclusion of any or all of the equal opportunity clause in any specific contract or subcontract when he deems that special circumstances in the national interest so require. The Director may also exempt groups or categories of contracts or subcontracts of the same type where he finds it impracticable to act upon each request individually or where group exemptions will contribute to convenience in the administration of the order.

(2)The Director may exempt from the requirements of the equal opportunity clause any of a prime contractor's or subcontractor's facilities which he finds to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the prime contractor or subcontractor related to the performance of the contract or subcontract, provided that he also finds that such an exemption will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the order.

(c)Any requirement set forth in these regulations in this part shall not apply to any contract or subcontract whenever the head of an agency determines that such contract or subcontract is essential to the national security and that its award without complying with such requirement is necessary to the national security. Upon making such a determination, the head of the agency will notify the Director in writing within 30 days.

(d)When any contract or subcontract is of a class exempted under this section, the Director may withdraw the exemption for a specific contract or subcontract or group of contracts or subcontracts when in his judgment such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the order. Such withdrawal shall not apply to contracts or subcontracts awarded prior to the withdrawal, except that in procurements entered into by formal advertising, or the various forms of restricted formal advertising, such withdrawal shall not apply unless the withdrawal is made more than 10 calendar days before the date set for the opening of the bids.

(a)(1) Each prime contractor and subcontractor shall file annually, on or before the September 30, complete and accurate reports on Standard Form 100 (EEO&#x2013;1) promulgated jointly by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Plans for Progress or such form as may hereafter be promulgated in its place if such prime contractor or subcontractor (i) is not exempt from the provisions of these regulations in accordance with § 60&#x2013;1.5; (ii) has 50 or more employees; (iii) is a prime contractor or first tier subcontractor; and (iv) has a contract, subcontract or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more or serves as a depository of Government funds in any amount, or is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes:That any subcontractor below the first tier which performs construction work at the site of construction shall be required to file such a report if it meets requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this section.

(2) Each person required by § 60&#x2013;1.7(a)(1) to submit reports shall file such a report with the contracting or administering agency within 30 days after the award to him of a contract or subcontract, unless such person has submitted such a report within 12 months preceding the date of the award. Subsequent reports shall be submitted annually in accordance with § 60&#x2013;1.7(a)(1), or at such other intervals as the Director may require. The Director may extend the time for filing any report.

(3) The Director or the applicant, on their own motions, may require a contractor to keep employment or other records and to furnish, in the form requested, within reasonable limits, such information as the Director or the applicant deems necessary for the administration of the order.

(4) Failure to file timely, complete and accurate reports as required constitutes noncompliance with the prime contractor's or subcontractor's obligations under the equal opportunity clause and is ground for the imposition by the Director, an applicant, prime contractor or subcontractor, of any sanctions as authorized by the order and the regulations in this part.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Each agency shall require each bidder or prospective prime contractor and proposed subcontractor, where appropriate, to state in the bid or in writing at the outset of negotiations for the contract: (i) Whether it has developed and has on file at each establishment affirmative action programs pursuant to part 60&#x2013;2 of this chapter; (ii) whether it has participated in any previous contract or subcontract subject to the equal opportunity clause; (iii) whether it has filed with the Joint Reporting Committee, the Director or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission all reports due under the applicable filing requirements.

(2)A bidder or prospective prime contractor or proposed subcontractor shall be required to submit such information as the Director requests prior to the award of the contract or subcontract. When a determination has been made to award the contract or subcontract to a specific contractor, such contractor shall be required, prior to award, or after the award, or both, to furnish such other information as the applicant or the Director requests.

(c)Reports filed pursuant to this section shall be used only in connection with the administration of the order, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or in furtherance of the purposes of the order and said Act.

###### § 60-1.8 Segregated facilities.

To comply with its obligations under the Order, a contractor must ensure that facilities provided for employees are provided in such a manner that segregation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin cannot result. The contractor may neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by employee custom. The contractor's obligation extends further to ensuring that its employees are not assigned to perform their services at any location, under the contractor's control, where the facilities are segregated. This obligation extends to all contracts containing the equal opportunity clause regardless of the amount of the contract. The term “facilities,” as used in this section, means waiting rooms, work areas, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, restrooms, wash rooms, locker rooms, and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing provided for employees; Provided, That separate or single-user restrooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

###### § 60-1.9 Compliance by labor unions and by recruiting and training agencies.

(a) Whenever compliance with the equal opportunity clause may necessitate a revision of a collective bargaining agreement the labor union or unions which are parties to such an agreement shall be given an adequate opportunity to present their views to the Director.

(b) The Director shall use his best efforts, directly and through agencies, contractors, subcontractors, applicants, State and local officials, public and private agencies, and all other available instrumentalities, to cause any labor union, recruiting and training agency or other representative of workers who are or may be engaged in work under contracts and subcontracts to cooperate with, and to comply in the implementation of, the purposes of the order.

(c) In order to effectuate the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the Director may hold hearings, public or private, with respect to the practices and policies of any such labor union or recruiting and training agency.

(d) The Director may notify any Federal, State, or local agency of his conclusions and recommendations with respect to any such labor organization or recruiting and training agency which in his judgment has failed to cooperate with himself, agencies, prime contractors, subcontractors, or applicants in carrying out the purposes of the order. The Director also may notify the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, or other appropriate Federal agencies whenever he has reason to believe that the practices of any such labor organization or agency violates title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or other provisions of Federal law.

###### § 60-1.10 Foreign government practices.

Contractors shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin when hiring or making employee assignments for work to be performed in the United States or abroad. Contractors are exempted from this obligation only when hiring persons outside the United States for work to be performed outside the United States (see 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.5(a)(3)). Therefore, a contractor hiring workers in the United States for either Federal or nonfederally connected work shall be in violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, by refusing to employ or assign any person because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin regardless of the policies of the country where the work is to be performed or for whom the work will be performed. Should any contractor be unable to acquire a visa of entry for any employee or potential employee to a country in which or with which it is doing business, and which refusal it believes is due to the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin of the employee or potential employee, the contractor must immediately notify the Department of State and the Director of such refusal.

###### § 60-1.11 Payment or reimbursement of membership fees and other expenses to private clubs.

(a)(1) A contractor which maintains a policy or practice of paying membership fees or other expenses for employee participation in private clubs or organizations shall ensure that the policy or practice is administered without regard to the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of employees.

(2) Payment or reimbursement by contractors of membership fees and other expenses for participation by their employees in a private club or organization which bars, restricts or limits its membership on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin constitutes a violation of Executive Order 11246 except where the contractor can provide evidence that such restrictions or limitations do not abridge the promotional opportunities, status, compensation or other terms and conditions of employment of those of its employees barred from membership because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. OFCCP shall provide the contractor with the opportunity to present evidence in defense of its actions.

(b) The contractor has the responsibility of determining whether the club or organization restricts membership on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The contractor may make separate determinations for different chapters of an organization, and where it does so, may limit any necessary corrective action to the particular chapters which observe discriminatory membership policies and practices.

###### § 60-1.12 Record retention.

(a)Any personnel or employment record made or kept by the contractor shall be preserved by the contractor for a period of not less than two years from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. However, if the contractor has fewer than 150 employees or does not have a Government contract of at least $150,000, the minimum record retention period shall be one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. Such records include, but are not necessarily limited to, records pertaining to hiring, assignment, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay off or termination, rates of pay or other terms of compensation, and selection for training or apprenticeship, and other records having to do with requests for reasonable accommodation, the results of any physical examination, job advertisements and postings, applications, resumes, and any and all expressions of interest through the Internet or related electronic data technologies as to which the contractor considered the individual for a particular position, such as on-line resumes or internal resume databases, records identifying job seekers contacted regarding their interest in a particular position (for purposes of recordkeeping with respect to internal resume databases, the contractor must maintain a record of each resume added to the database, a record of the date each resume was added to the database, the position for which each search of the database was made, and corresponding to each search, the substantive search criteria used and the date of the search; for purposes of recordkeeping with respect to external resume databases, the contractor must maintain a record of the position for which each search of the database was made, and corresponding to each search, the substantive search criteria used, the date of the search, and the resumes of job seekers who met the basic qualifications for the particular position who are considered by the contractor), regardless of whether the individual qualifies as an Internet Applicant under 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.3, tests and test results, and interview notes. The term “personnel records relevant to the complaint,” for example, would include personnel or employment records relating to the complainant and to all other employees holding positions similar to that held or sought by the complainant and application forms or test papers submitted by unsuccessful applicants and by all other candidates for the same position as that for which the complainant unsuccessfully applied. Where a compliance evaluation has been initiated, all personnel and employment records described above are relevant until OFCCP makes a final disposition of the evaluation.

(b)A contractor establishment required under § 60&#x2013;1.40 to develop and maintain a written affirmative action program (AAP) must maintain its current AAP and documentation of good faith effort, and must preserve its AAP and documentation of good faith effort for the immediately preceding AAP year, unless it was not then covered by the AAP requirement.

(c)(1) For any record the contractor maintains pursuant to this section, the contractor must be able to identify:

(i) The gender, race, and ethnicity of each employee; and

(ii) Where possible, the gender, race, and ethnicity of each applicant or Internet Applicant as defined in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.3, whichever is applicable to the particular position.

(2) The contractor must supply this information to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs upon request.

(d)When evaluating whether a contractor has maintained information on impact and conducted an adverse impact analysis under part 60&#x2013;3 with respect to Internet hiring procedures, OFCCP will require only those records relating to the analyses of the impact of employee selection procedures on Internet Applicants, as defined in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.3, and those records relating to the analyses of the impact of employment tests that are used as employee selection procedures, without regard to whether the tests were administered to Internet Applicants, as defined in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.3.

(e)Failure to preserve complete and accurate records as required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section constitutes noncompliance with the contractor's obligations under the Executive Order and this part. Where the contractor has destroyed or failed to preserve records as required by this section, there may be a presumption that the information destroyed or not preserved would have been unfavorable to the contractor: Provided, That this presumption shall not apply where the contractor shows that the destruction or failure to preserve records results from the circumstances that are outside of the contractor's control.

##### Subpart B - General Enforcement; Compliance Review and Complaint Procedure

###### § 60-1.20 Compliance evaluations.

(a) OFCCP may conduct compliance evaluations to determine if the contractor maintains nondiscriminatory hiring and employment practices and is taking affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are placed, trained, upgraded, promoted, and otherwise treated during employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. A compliance evaluation may consist of any one or any combination of the following investigative procedures:

(1)A comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the hiring and employment practices of the contractor, the written affirmative action program, and the results of the affirmative action efforts undertaken by the contractor. A compliance review may proceed in three stages:

(i) A desk audit of the written AAP and supporting documentation to determine whether all elements required by the regulations in this part are included, whether the AAP meets agency standards of reasonableness, and whether the AAP and supporting documentation satisfy agency standards of acceptability. The desk audit is conducted at OFCCP offices, except in the case of preaward reviews. In a preaward review, the desk audit normally is conducted at the contractor's establishment.

(ii) An on-site review, conducted at the contractor's establishment to investigate unresolved problem areas identified in the AAP and supporting documentation during the desk audit, to verify that the contractor has implemented the AAP and has complied with those regulatory obligations not required to be included in the AAP, and to examine potential instances or issues of discrimination. An on-site review normally will involve an examination of the contractor's personnel and employment policies, inspection and copying of documents related to employment actions, and interviews with employees, supervisors, managers, hiring officials; and

(iii) Where necessary, an off-site analysis of information supplied by the contractor or otherwise gathered during or pursuant to the on-site review.

(2)An analysis and evaluation of the AAP (or any part thereof) and supporting documentation, and other documents related to the contractor's personnel policies and employment actions that may be relevant to a determination of whether the contractor has complied with the requirements of the Executive Order and regulations;

(3)A determination of whether the contractor has maintained records consistent with § 60&#x2013;1.12; at the contractor's option the documents may be provided either on-site or off-site; or

(4)An on-site review restricted to one or more components of the contractor's organization or one or more aspects of the contractor's employment practices.

(b) Where deficiencies are found to exist, reasonable efforts shall be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion. Before the contractor can be found to be in compliance with the order, it must make a specific commitment, in writing, to correct any such deficiencies. The commitment must include the precise action to be taken and dates for completion. The time period allotted shall be no longer than the minimum period necessary to effect such changes. Upon approval of the commitment, the contractor may be considered in compliance, on condition that the commitments are faithfully kept. The contractor shall be notified that making such commitments does not preclude future determinations of noncompliance based on a finding that the commitments are not sufficient to achieve compliance.

(c) [Reserved]

(d)Each agency shall include in the invitation for bids for each formally advertised nonconstruction contract or state at the outset of negotiations for each negotiated contract, that if the award, when let, should total $10 million or more, the prospective contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with subcontracts of $10 million or more shall be subject to a compliance evaluation before the award of the contract unless OFCCP has conducted an evaluation and found them to be in compliance with the Order within the preceding 24 months. The awarding agency will notify OFCCP and request appropriate action and findings in accordance with this subsection. Within 15 days of the notice OFCCP will inform the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation. If OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a preaward compliance evaluation, OFCCP shall be allowed an additional 20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its conclusions within that period, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.

(e)Each prime contractor or subcontractor with 50 or more employees and a contract of $50,000 or more is required to develop a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments (§ 60&#x2013;1.40). If a contractor fails to submit an affirmative action program and supporting documents, including the workforce analysis, within 30 days of a request, the enforcement procedures specified in § 60&#x2013;1.26(b) shall be applicable. Contractors may reach agreement with OFCCP on nationwide AAP formats or on frequency of updating statistics.

(f)If the contractor is concerned with the confidentiality of such information as lists of employee names, reasons for termination, or pay data, then alphabetic or numeric coding or the use of an index of pay and pay ranges, consistent with the ranges assigned to each job group, are acceptable for purposes of the compliance evaluation. The contractor must provide full access to all relevant data on-site as required by § 60&#x2013;1.43. Where necessary, the compliance officer may take information made available during the on-site evaluation off-site for further analysis. An off-site analysis should be conducted where issues have arisen concerning deficiencies or an apparent violation which, in the judgment of the compliance officer, should be more thoroughly analyzed off-site before a determination of compliance is made. The contractor must provide all data determined by the compliance officer to be necessary for off-site analysis. Such data may only be coded if the contractor makes the key to the code available to the compliance officer. If the contractor believes that particular information which is to be taken off-site is not relevant to compliance with the Executive Order, the contractor may request a ruling by the OFCCP District/Area Director. The OFCCP District/Area Director shall issue a ruling within 10 days. The contractor may appeal that ruling to the OFCCP Regional Director within 10 days. The Regional Director shall issue a final ruling within 10 days. Pending a final ruling, the information in question must be made available to the compliance officer off-site, but shall be considered a part of the investigatory file and subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. The agency shall take all necessary precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of such information until a final determination is made. Such information may not be copied by OFCCP and access to the information shall be limited to the compliance officer and personnel involved in the determination of relevancy. Data determined to be not relevant to the investigation will be returned to the contractor immediately.

(g)OFCCP will treat information obtained in the compliance evaluation as confidential to the maximum extent the information is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It is the practice of OFCCP not to release data where the contractor is still in business, and the contractor indicates, and through the Department of Labor review process it is determined, that the data are confidential and sensitive and that the release of data would subject the contractor to commercial harm.

###### § 60-1.21 Filing complaints.

Complaints shall be filed within 180 days of the alleged violation unless the time for filing is extended by the Director for good cause shown.

###### § 60-1.22 Where to file.

Complaints may be filed with the OFCCP, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, or with any OFCCP regional or area office.

###### § 60-1.23 Contents of complaint.

(a) The complaint shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the complainant, the name and address of the contractor or subcontractor committing the alleged discrimination, a description of the acts considered to be discriminatory, and any other pertinent information which will assist in the investigation and resolution of the complaint. The complaint shall be signed by the complainant or his/her authorized representative. Complaints alleging class-type violations which do not identify the alleged discriminatee or discriminatees will be accepted, provided the other requirements of this paragraph are met.

(b) If a complaint contains incomplete information, OFCCP shall seek the needed information from the complainant. In the event such information is not furnished to the Director within 60 days of the date of such request, the case may be closed.

###### § 60-1.24 Processing of matters.

(a)OFCCP may refer appropriate complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for processing under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, rather than processing under E.O. 11246 and the regulations in this chapter. Upon referring complaints to the EEOC, OFCCP shall promptly notify complainant(s) and the contractor of such referral.

(b)In conducting complaint investigations, OFCCP shall, as a minimum, conduct a thorough evaluation of the allegations of the complaint and shall be responsible for developing a complete case record. The case record should contain the name, address, and telephone number of each person interviewed, the interview statements, copies, transcripts, or summaries (where appropriate) of pertinent documents, a reference to at least one covered contract, and a narrative report of the investigation with references to exhibits and other evidence which relate to the alleged violations.

(c)(1) [Reserved]

(2) If any complaint investigation or compliance review indicates a violation of the equal opportunity clause, the matter should be resolved by informal means whenever possible. Such informal means may include the holding of a compliance conference.

(3) Where any complaint investigation or compliance review indicates a violation of the equal opportunity clause and the matter has not been resolved by informal means, the Director shall proceed in accordance with § 60&#x2013;1.26.

(4) When a prime contractor or subcontractor, without a hearing, shall have complied with the recommendations or orders of the Director and believes such recommendations or orders to be erroneous, he shall, upon filing a request therefor within ten days of such compliance, be afforded an opportunity for a hearing and review of the alleged erroneous action.

(5) For reasonable cause shown, the Director may reconsider or cause to be reconsidered any matter on his/her own motion or pursuant to a request.

(d)(1) With the exception of complaints which have been referred to EEOC, within 60 days from receipt of a complaint or within such additional time as may be allowed by the Director for good cause shown, the complaint shall be processed and the case record developed containing the following information:

(i) Name and address of the complainant;

(ii) Brief summary of findings, including a statement regarding the contractor's compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the equal opportunity clause;

(iii) A statement of the disposition of the case, including any corrective action taken and any sanctions or penalties imposed or, whenever appropriate, the recommended corrective action and sanctions or penalties.

(2) A written report of every preaward compliance review required by this regulation or otherwise required by the Director, shall be developed and maintained.

(3) A written report of every other compliance review or any other matter processed involving an apparent violation of the equal opportunity clause shall be made. Such report shall contain a brief summary of the findings, including a statement of conclusions regarding the contractor's compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the order, and a statement of the disposition of the case, including any corrective action taken or recommended and any sanctions or penalties imposed or recommended.

###### § 60-1.25 Assumption of jurisdiction by or referrals to the Director.

The Director may inquire into the status of any matter pending before an agency. Where he considers it necessary or appropriate to the achievement of the purposes of the order, he may assume jurisdiction over the matter and proceed as provided herein. Whenever the Director assumes jurisdiction over any matter, or an agency refers any matter he may conduct, or have conducted, such investigations, hold such hearings, make such findings, issue such recommendations and directives, order such sanctions and penalties, and take such other action as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the order. The Director shall promptly notify the agency of any corrective action to be taken or any sanctions to be taken or any sanction to be imposed by the agency. The agency shall take such action, and report the results thereof to the Director within the time specified.

###### § 60-1.26 Enforcement proceedings.

(a)(1) Violations of the Order, the equal opportunity clause, the regulations in this chapter, or applicable construction industry equal employment opportunity requirements, may result in the institution of administrative or judicial enforcement proceedings. Violations may be found based upon,any of the following:

(i) The results of a complaint investigation;

(ii) The results of a compliance evaluation;

(iii) Analysis of an affirmative action program;

(iv) The results of an on-site review of the contractor's compliance with the Order and its implementing regulations;

(v) A contractor's refusal to submit an affirmative action program;

(vi) A contractor's refusal to allow an on-site compliance evaluation to be conducted;

(vii) A contractor's refusal to provide data for off-site review or analysis as required by the regulations in this chapter;

(viii) A contractor's refusal to establish, maintain and supply records or other information as required by the regulations in this chapter or applicable construction industry requirements;

(ix) A contractor's alteration or falsification of records and information required to be maintained by the regulations in this chapter; or

(x) Any substantial or material violation or the threat of a substantial or material violation of the contractural provisions of the Order, or of the rules or regulations in this chapter.

(2) OFCCP may seek back pay and other make whole relief for victims of discrimination identified during a complaint investigation or compliance evaluation. Such individuals need not have filed a complaint as a prerequisite to OFCCP seeking such relief on their behalf. Interest on back pay shall be calculated from the date of the loss and compounded quarterly at the percentage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service for the under-payment of taxes.

(b)(1) OFCCP may refer matters to the Solicitor of Labor with a recommendation for the institution of administrative enforcement proceedings, which may be brought to enjoin violations, to seek appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions. The referral may be made when violations have not been corrected in accordance with the conciliation procedures in this chapter, or when OFCCP determines that referral for consideration of formal enforcement (rather than settlement) is appropriate. However, if a contractor refuses to submit an affirmative action program, or refuses to supply records or other requested information, or refuses to allow OFCCP access to its premises for an on-site review, and if conciliation efforts under this chapter are unsuccessful, OFCCP may immediately refer the matter to the Solicitor, notwithstanding other requirements of this chapter.

(2) Administrative enforcement proceedings shall be conducted under the control and supervision of the Solicitor of Labor and under the Rules of Practice for Administrative Proceedings to Enforce Equal Opportunity under Executive Order 11246 contained in part 60&#x2013;30 of this chapter and the Rules of Evidence set out in the Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges contained in 29 CFR part 18, subpart B:That a Final Administrative Order shall be issued within on year from the date of the issuance of the recommended findings, conclusions and decision of the Administrative Law Judge, or the submission of any exceptions and responses to exceptions to such decision (if any), whichever is later.

(c)(1) The Director may refer matters to the Department of Justice with a recommendation for the institution of judicial enforcement proceedings. There are no procedural prerequisites to a referral to the Department of Justice. Such referrals may be accomplished without proceeding through the conciliation procedures in this chapter, and a referral may be made at any stage in the procedures under this chapter.

(2) Whenever a matter has been referred to the Department of Justice for consideration of judicial enforcement, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States requesting a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction (including relief against noncontractors, including labor unions, who seek to thwart the implementation of the Order and regulations), and an order for such additional sanctions or relief, including back pay, deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights secured by the Order, or any of the above in this paragraph (c)(2).

(3) The Attorney General is authorized to conduct such investigation of the facts as he/she deem necessary or appropriate to carry out his/her responsibilities under the regulations in this chapter.

(4) Prior to the institution of any judicial proceedings, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Director, is authorized to make reasonable efforts to secure compliance with the contract provisions of the Order. The Attorney General may do so by providing the contractor and any other respondent with reasonable notice of his/her findings, his/her intent to file suit, and the actions he/she believes necessary to obtain compliance with the contract provisions of the Order without contested litigation, and by offering the contractor and any other respondent a reasonable opportunity for conference and conciliation, in an effort to obtain such compliance without contested litigation.

(5) As used in the regulations in this part, the Attorney General shall mean the Attorney General, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, or any other person authorized by regulations or practice to act for the Attorney General with respect to the enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws, orders and regulations generally, or in a particular matter or case.

(6) The Director or his/her designee, and representatives of the Attorney General may consult from time to time to determine what investigations should be conducted to determine whether contractors or groups of contractors or other persons may be engaged in patterns or practices in violation of the Executive Order or these regulations, or of resistance to or interference with the full enjoyment of any of the rights secured by them, warranting judicial proceedings.

(d)In addition to initiating lawsuits upon referral under this section, the Attorney General may, subject to approval by the Director, initiate independent investigations of contractors which he/she has reason to believe may be in violation of the Order or the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. If, upon completion of such an investigation, the Attorney General determines that the contractor has in fact violated the Order or the rules and regulations issued thereunder, he/she shall make reasonable efforts to secure compliance with the contract provisions of the Order. He/she may do so by providing the contractor and any other respondent with reasonable notice of the Department of Justice's findings, its intent to file suit, and the actions that the Attorney General believes are necessary to obtain compliance with the contract provisions of the Order without contested litigation, and by offering the contractor and any other respondent a reasonable opportunity for conference and conciliation in an effort to obtain such compliance without contested litigation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the Attorney General may, upon approval by the Director, bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States requesting a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, and an order for such additional sanctions or equitable relief, including back pay, deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights secured by the Order or any of the above in this paragraph (d).

(e) To the extent applicable, this section and part 60&#x2013;30 of this chapter shall govern proceedings resulting from any Director's determinations under § 60&#x2013;2.2(b) of this chapter.

###### § 60-1.27 Sanctions.

(a)The sanctions described in subsections (1), (5), and (6) of section 209(a) of the Order may be exercised only by or with the approval of the Director. Referral of any matter arising under the Order to the Department of Justice or to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be made by the Director.

(b)A contractor may be debarred from receiving future contracts or modifications or extensions of existing contracts, subject to reinstatement pursuant to § 60&#x2013;1.31, for any violation of Executive Order 11246 or the implementing rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor. Debarment may be imposed for an indefinite term or for a fixed minimum period of at least six months.

###### § 60-1.28 Show cause notices.

When the Director has reasonable cause to believe that a contractor has violated the equal opportunity clause he may issue a notice requiring the contractor to show cause, within 30 days, why monitoring, enforcement proceedings or other appropriate action to ensure compliance should not be instituted.

###### § 60-1.29 Preaward notices.

(a)Upon the request of the Director, agencies shall not enter into contracts or approve the entry into contracts or subcontracts with any bidder, prospective prime contractor, or proposed subcontractor named by the Director until a preaward compliance review has been conducted and the Director or his designee has approved a determination that the bidder, prospective prime contractor or proposed subcontractor will be able to comply with the provisions of the equal opportunity clause.

(b)Upon the request of the Director, agencies shall not enter into contracts or approve the entry into subcontracts with any bidder; prospective prime contractor or proposed subcontractor specified by the Director until the agency has complied with the directions contained in the request.

###### § 60-1.30 Notification of agencies.

The Director shall ensure that the heads of all agencies are notified of any debarment taken against any contractor.

###### § 60-1.31 Reinstatement of ineligible contractors.

A contractor debarred from further contracts for an indefinite period under the Order may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director at any time after the effective date of the debarment. A contractor debarred for a fixed period may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director 30 days prior to the expiration of the fixed debarment period, or at any time thereafter. The filing of a reinstatement request 30 days before a fixed debarment period ends will not result in early reinstatement. In connection with the reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors shall be required to show that they have established and will carry out employment policies and practices in compliance with the Order and implementing regulations. Before reaching a decision, the Director may conduct a compliance evaluation of the contractor and may require the contractor to supply additional information regarding the request for reinstatement. The Director shall issue a written decision on the request.

###### § 60-1.32 Intimidation and interference.

(a) The contractor, subcontractor or applicant shall not harass, intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual because the individual has engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;

(2) Assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the Order or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity;

(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by the Order or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity; or

(4) Exercising any other right protected by the Order.

(b) The contractor, subcontractor or applicant shall ensure that all persons under its control do not engage in such harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion or discrimination. The sanctions and penalties contained in this part may be exercised by OFCCP against any contractor, subcontractor or applicant who violates this obligation.

###### § 60-1.33 Resolution procedures.

(a)If a compliance review or other review by OFCCP indicates evidence sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice, subject to the following parameters and the approval of the Director or acting agency head:

(1) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate treatment theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate that the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Provide qualitative evidence as defined in this part that, in combination with other evidence, supports both a finding of discriminatory intent by the contractor and a finding that the contractor's discriminatory intent caused the disparate treatment.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice under a disparate treatment theory of liability without satisfying all three components listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if:

(i) The qualitative evidence by itself is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment;

(ii) The evidence of disparity between a favored and disfavored group is so extraordinarily compelling that by itself it is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment; or

(iii) Paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and the contractor denied OFCCP access to sources of evidence that may be relevant to a preliminary finding of discriminatory intent. This may include denying access to its employees during a compliance evaluation or destroying or failing to produce records the contractor is legally required to create and maintain.

(3) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate impact theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Identify the specific policy or practice of the contractor causing the adverse impact, unless OFCCP can demonstrate that the elements of the contractor's selection procedures are incapable of separation for analysis.

(4) The Predetermination Notice must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Predetermination Notice; however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Predetermination Notice based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation for why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(5) Any response to a Predetermination Notice must be submitted by the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Notice, which deadline OFCCP may extend for good cause.

(b)(1) If, following OFCCP's review of any response by the contractor pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the agency has evidence sufficient to support a finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, as established in the parameters and exceptions in paragraph (a) of this section, or that the contractor has committed other material violations of the equal opportunity clause (with the exception of violations for denying access or failing to submit records in response to OFCCP's Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-approved Scheduling Letters, for which OFCCP may proceed directly to issuing a Show Cause Notice), OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation to the contractor requiring corrective action and inviting conciliation through a written agreement, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation alleging a finding of discrimination following issuance of a Predetermination Notice if the contractor does not respond or provide a sufficient response within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Predetermination Notice, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head, unless OFCCP has extended the Predetermination Notice response time for good cause shown.

(3) The Notice of Violation must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Notice of Violation, however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Notice of Violation based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(4) The Notice of Violation must address all relevant concerns and defenses raised by the contractor in response to the Predetermination Notice.

(c)If a compliance review, complaint investigation, or other review by OFCCP or its representative indicates a material violation of the equal opportunity clause, and:

(1) If the contractor, subcontractor or bidder is willing to correct the violations and/or deficiencies; and

(2) If OFCCP or its representative determines that settlement (rather than referral for consideration of formal enforcement) is appropriate, a written agreement shall be required. The agreement shall provide for such remedial action as may be necessary to correct the violations and/or deficiencies noted, including, where appropriate (but not necessarily limited to), remedies such as back pay and retroactive seniority.

(d)A contractor may voluntarily waive the procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section to enter directly into a conciliation agreement. OFCCP may inform the contractor of this expedited conciliation option, but may not require or insist that the contractor avail itself of the expedited conciliation option.

(e)Should a court of competent jurisdiction hold any provision(s) of this section to be invalid, such action will not affect any other provision of this section.

###### § 60-1.34 Violation of a Conciliation Agreement.

When a conciliation agreement has been violated, the following procedures are applicable:

(a) A written notice shall be sent to the contractor setting forth the violations alleged and summarizing the supporting evidence. The contractor shall have 15 days from receipt of the notice to respond, except in those cases in which such a delay would result in irreparable injury to the employment rights of affected employees or applicants.

(b) During the 15-day period the contractor may demonstrate in writing that it has not violated its commitments.

(c) If the contractor is unable to demonstrate that it has not violated its commitments, or if the complaint alleges irreparable injury, enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately without issuing a show cause notice or proceeding through any other requirement contained in this chapter.

(d) In any proceeding involving an alleged violation of a conciliation agreement OFCCP may seek enforcement of the agreement itself and shall not be required to present proof of the underlying violations resolved by the agreement.

###### § 60-1.35 Contractor obligations and defenses to violation of the nondiscrimination requirement for compensation disclosures.

(a)A contractor may pursue a defense to an alleged violation of paragraph (3) of the equal opportunity clauses listed in § 60&#x2013;1.4(a) and (b) as long as the defense is not based on a rule, policy, practice, agreement, or other instrument that prohibits employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants, subject to paragraph (3) of the equal opportunity clause. Contractors may pursue this defense by demonstrating, for example, that it disciplined the employee for violation of a consistently and uniformly applied company policy, and that this policy does not prohibit, or tend to prohibit, employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing their compensation or the compensation of other employees or applicants.

(b)Actions taken by a contractor which adversely affect an employee will not be deemed to be discriminatory if the employee has access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as part of such employee's essential job functions and disclosed the compensation of such other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to such information, and the disclosure was not in response to a formal complaint or charge, in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the contractor, or is consistent with the contractor's legal duty to furnish information.

(c)The contractor or subcontractor shall disseminate the nondiscrimination provision, using the language as prescribed by the Director of OFCCP, to employees and applicants:

(1) The nondiscrimination provision shall be incorporated into existing employee manuals or handbooks; and

(2) The nondiscrimination provision shall be disseminated to employees and applicants. Dissemination of the provision shall be executed by electronic posting or by posting a copy of the provision in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.

#### PART 60-2 - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 60-2.1 Scope and application.

(a)The requirements of this part apply to nonconstruction (supply and service) contractors. The regulations prescribe the contents of affirmative action programs, standards and procedures for evaluating the compliance of affirmative action programs implemented pursuant to this part, and related matters.

(b)(1) Each nonconstruction contractor must develop and maintain a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments if it has 50 or more employees and:

(i) Has a contract of $50,000 or more; or

(ii) Has Government bills of lading which in any 12-month period, total or can reasonably be expected to total $50,000 or more; or

(iii) Serves as a depository of Government funds in any amount; or

(iv) Is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes in any amount.

(2) Each contractor and subcontractor must require each nonconstruction subcontractor to develop and maintain a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments if it has 50 or more employees and:

(i) Has a subcontract of $50,000 or more; or

(ii) Has Government bills of lading which in any 12-month period, total or can reasonably be expected to total $50,000 or more; or

(iii) Serves as a depository of Government funds in any amount; or

(iv) Is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes in any amount.

(c)The affirmative action programs required under paragraph (b) of this section must be developed within 120 days from the commencement of a contract and must be updated annually.

(d)Contractors subject to the affirmative action program requirements must develop and maintain a written affirmative action program for each of their establishments. Each employee in the contractor's workforce must be included in an affirmative action program. Each employee must be included in the affirmative action program of the establishment at which he or she works, except that:

(1) Employees who work at establishments other than that of the manager to whom they report, must be included in the affirmative action program of their manager.

(2) Employees who work at an establishment where the contractor employs fewer than 50 employees, may be included under any of the following three options: In an affirmative action program which covers just that establishment; in the affirmative action program which covers the location of the personnel function which supports the establishment; or, in the affirmative action program which covers the location of the official to whom they report.

(3) Employees for whom selection decisions are made at a higher level establishment within the organization must be included in the affirmative action program of the establishment where the selection decision is made.

(4) If a contractor wishes to establish an affirmative action program other than by establishment, the contractor may reach agreement with OFCCP on the development and use of affirmative action programs based on functional or business units. The Director, or his or her designee, must approve such agreements. Agreements allowing the use of functional or business unit affirmative action programs cannot be construed to limit or restrict how the OFCCP structures its compliance evaluations.

(e)If pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section employees are included in an affirmative action program for an establishment other than the one in which the employees are located, the organizational profile and job group analysis of the affirmative action program in which the employees are included must be annotated to identify the actual location of such employees. If the establishment at which the employees actually are located maintains an affirmative action program, the organizational profile and job group analysis of that program must be annotated to identify the program in which the employees are included.

###### § 60-2.2 Agency action.

(a) Any contractor required by § 60&#x2013;2.1 to develop and maintain a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments that has not complied with that section is not in full compliance with Executive Order 11246, as amended. When a contractor is required to submit its affirmative action program to OFCCP (e.g., for a compliance evaluation), the affirmative action program will be deemed to have been accepted by the Government at the time OFCCP notifies the contractor of completion of the compliance evaluation or other action, unless within 45 days thereafter the Deputy Assistant Secretary has disapproved such program.

(b) If, in determining such contractor's responsibility for an award of a contract it comes to the contracting officer's attention, through sources within his/her agency or through the OFCCP or other Government agencies, that the contractor does not have an affirmative action program at each of its establishments, or has substantially deviated from such an approved affirmative action program, or has failed to develop or implement an affirmative action program which complies with the regulations in this chapter, the contracting officer must declare the contractor/bidder nonresponsible and so notify the contractor and the Deputy Assistant Secretary, unless the contracting officer otherwise affirmatively determines that the contractor is able to comply with the equal employment obligations. Any contractor/bidder which has been declared nonresponsible in accordance with the provisions of this section may request the Deputy Assistant Secretary to determine that the responsibility of the contractor/bidder raises substantial issues of law or fact to the extent that a hearing is required. Such request must set forth the basis upon which the contractor/bidder seeks such a determination. If the Director, in his/her sole discretion, determines that substantial issues of law or fact exist, an administrative or judicial proceeding may be commenced in accordance with the regulations contained in § 60&#x2013;1.26; or the Deputy Assistant Secretary may require the investigation or compliance evaluation be developed further or additional conciliation be conducted: Provided, That during any pre-award conferences, every effort will be made through the processes of conciliation, mediation, and persuasion to develop an acceptable affirmative action program meeting the standards and guidelines set forth in this part so that, in the performance of the contract, the contractor is able to meet its equal employment obligations in accordance with the equal opportunity clause and applicable rules, regulations, and orders: Provided further, That a contractor/bidder may not be declared nonresponsible more than twice due to past noncompliance with the equal opportunity clause at a particular establishment or facility without receiving prior notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

(c)(1) Immediately upon finding that a contractor has no affirmative action program, or has deviated substantially from an approved affirmative action program, or has failed to develop or implement an affirmative action program which complies with the requirements of the regulations in this chapter, that fact shall be recorded in the investigation file. Except as provided in § 60&#x2013;1.26(b)(1), whenever administrative enforcement is contemplated, the notice to the contractor shall be issued giving the contractor 30 days to show cause why enforcement proceedings under section 209(a) of Executive Order 11246, as amended, should not be instituted. The notice to show cause should contain:

(i) An itemization of the sections of the Executive Order and of the regulations with which the contractor has been found in apparent violation, and a summary of the conditions, practices, facts, or circumstances which give rise to each apparent violation;

(ii) The corrective actions necessary to achieve compliance or, as may be appropriate, the concepts and principles of an acceptable remedy and/or the corrective action results anticipated;

(iii) A request for a written response to the findings, including commitments to corrective action or the presentation of opposing facts and evidence; and

(iv) A suggested date for the conciliation conference.

(2) If the contractor fails to show good cause for its failure or fails to remedy that failure by developing and implementing an acceptable affirmative action program within 30 days, the case file shall be processed for enforcement proceedings pursuant to § 60&#x2013;1.26 of this chapter. If an administrative complaint is filed, the contractor shall have 20 days to request a hearing. If a request for hearing has not been received within 20 days from the filing of the administrative complaint, the matter shall proceed in accordance with part 60&#x2013;30 of this chapter.

(3) During the “show cause” period of 30 days, every effort will be made through conciliation, mediation, and persuasion to resolve the deficiencies which led to the determination of nonresponsibility. If satisfactory adjustments designed to bring the contractor into compliance are not concluded, the case shall be processed for enforcement proceedings pursuant to § 60&#x2013;1.26 of this chapter.

(d) During the “show cause” period and formal proceedings, each contracting agency must continue to determine the contractor's responsibility in considering whether or not to award a new or additional contract.

##### Subpart B - Purpose and Contents of Affirmative Action Programs

###### § 60-2.10 General purpose and contents of affirmative action programs.

(a)(1) An affirmative action program is a management tool designed to ensure equal employment opportunity. A central premise underlying affirmative action is that, absent discrimination, over time a contractor's workforce, generally, will reflect the gender, racial and ethnic profile of the labor pools from which the contractor recruits and selects. Affirmative action programs contain a diagnostic component which includes a number of quantitative analyses designed to evaluate the composition of the workforce of the contractor and compare it to the composition of the relevant labor pools. Affirmative action programs also include action-oriented programs. If women and minorities are not being employed at a rate to be expected given their availability in the relevant labor pool, the contractor's affirmative action program includes specific practical steps designed to address this underutilization. Effective affirmative action programs also include internal auditing and reporting systems as a means of measuring the contractor's progress toward achieving the workforce that would be expected in the absence of discrimination.

(2) An affirmative action program also ensures equal employment opportunity by institutionalizing the contractor's commitment to equality in every aspect of the employment process. Therefore, as part of its affirmative action program, a contractor monitors and examines its employment decisions and compensation systems to evaluate the impact of those systems on women and minorities.

(3) An affirmative action program is, thus, more than a paperwork exercise. An affirmative action program includes those policies, practices, and procedures that the contractor implements to ensure that all qualified applicants and employees are receiving an equal opportunity for recruitment, selection, advancement, and every other term and privilege associated with employment. Affirmative action, ideally, is a part of the way the contractor regularly conducts its business. OFCCP has found that when an affirmative action program is approached from this perspective, as a powerful management tool, there is a positive correlation between the presence of affirmative action and the absence of discrimination.

(b)(1) An affirmative action program must include the following quantitative analyses:

(i) Organizational profile&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.11;

(ii) Job group analysis&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.12;

(iii) Placement of incumbents in job groups&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.13;

(iv) Determining availability&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.14;

(v) Comparing incumbency to availability&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.15; and

(vi) Placement goals&#x2014;§ 60&#x2013;2.16.

(2) In addition, an affirmative action program must include the following components specified in the § 60&#x2013;2.17 of this part:

(i) Designation of responsibility for implementation;

(ii) Identification of problem areas;

(iii) Action-oriented programs; and

(iv) Periodic internal audits.

(c)Contractors must maintain and make available to OFCCP documentation of their compliance with §§ 60&#x2013;2.11 through 60&#x2013;2.17.

###### § 60-2.11 Organizational profile.

(a)An organizational profile is a depiction of the staffing pattern within an establishment. It is one method contractors use to determine whether barriers to equal employment opportunity exist in their organizations. The profile provides an overview of the workforce at the establishment that may assist in identifying organizational units where women or minorities are underrepresented or concentrated. The contractor must use either the organizational display or the workforce analysis as its organizational profile:

(b)(1) An organizational display is a detailed graphical or tabular chart, text, spreadsheet or similar presentation of the contractor's organizational structure. The organizational display must identify each organizational unit in the establishment, and show the relationship of each organizational unit to the other organizational units in the establishment.

(2) An organizational unit is any component that is part of the contractor's corporate structure. In a more traditional organization, an organizational unit might be a department, division, section, branch, group or similar component. In a less traditional organization, an organizational unit might be a project team, job family, or similar component. The term includes an umbrella unit (such as a department) that contains a number of subordinate units, and it separately includes each of the subordinate units (such as sections or branches).

(3) For each organizational unit, the organizational display must indicate the following:

(i) The name of the unit;

(ii) The job title, gender, race, and ethnicity of the unit supervisor (if the unit has a supervisor);

(iii) The total number of male and female incumbents; and

(iv) the total number of male and female incumbents in each of the following groups: Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.

(c)(1) A workforce analysis is a listing of each job title as appears in applicable collective bargaining agreements or payroll records ranked from the lowest paid to the highest paid within each department or other similar organizational unit including departmental or unit supervision.

(2) If there are separate work units or lines of progression within a department, a separate list must be provided for each such work unit, or line, including unit supervisors. For lines of progression there must be indicated the order of jobs in the line through which an employee could move to the top of the line.

(3) Where there are no formal progression lines or usual promotional sequences, job titles should be listed by department, job families, or disciplines, in order of wage rates or salary ranges.

(4) For each job title, the total number of incumbents, the total number of male and female incumbents, and the total number of male and female incumbents in each of the following groups must be given: Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given. All job titles, including all managerial job titles, must be listed.

###### § 60-2.12 Job group analysis.

(a) Purpose: A job group analysis is a method of combining job titles within the contractor's establishment. This is the first step in the contractor's comparison of the representation of minorities and women in its workforce with the estimated availability of minorities and women qualified to be employed.

(b) In the job group analysis, jobs at the establishment with similar content, wage rates, and opportunities, must be combined to form job groups. Similarity of content refers to the duties and responsibilities of the job titles which make up the job group. Similarity of opportunities refers to training, transfers, promotions, pay, mobility, and other career enhancement opportunities offered by the jobs within the job group.

(c) The job group analysis must include a list of the job titles that comprise each job group. If, pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.1(d) and (e) the job group analysis contains jobs that are located at another establishment, the job group analysis must be annotated to identify the actual location of those jobs. If the establishment at which the jobs actually are located maintains an affirmative action program, the job group analysis of that program must be annotated to identify the program in which the jobs are included.

(d) Except as provided in § 60&#x2013;2.1(d), all jobs located at an establishment must be reported in the job group analysis of that establishment.

(e) Smaller employers: If a contractor has a total workforce of fewer than 150 employees, the contractor may prepare a job group analysis that utilizes EEO&#x2013;1 categories as job groups. EEO&#x2013;1 categories refers to the nine occupational groups used in the Standard Form 100, the Employer Information EEO&#x2013;1 Survey: Officials and managers, professionals, technicians, sales, office and clerical, craft workers (skilled), operatives (semiskilled), laborers (unskilled), and service workers.

###### § 60-2.13 Placement of incumbents in job groups.

The contractor must separately state the percentage of minorities and the percentage of women it employs in each job group established pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.12.

###### § 60-2.14 Determining availability.

(a) Purpose: Availability is an estimate of the number of qualified minorities or women available for employment in a given job group, expressed as a percentage of all qualified persons available for employment in the job group. The purpose of the availability determination is to establish a benchmark against which the demographic composition of the contractor's incumbent workforce can be compared in order to determine whether barriers to equal employment opportunity may exist within particular job groups.

(b) The contractor must separately determine the availability of minorities and women for each job group.

(c) In determining availability, the contractor must consider at least the following factors:

(1) The percentage of minorities or women with requisite skills in the reasonable recruitment area. The reasonable recruitment area is defined as the geographical area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably could seek workers to fill the positions in question.

(2) The percentage of minorities or women among those promotable, transferable, and trainable within the contractor's organization. Trainable refers to those employees within the contractor's organization who could, with appropriate training which the contractor is reasonably able to provide, become promotable or transferable during the AAP year.

(d) The contractor must use the most current and discrete statistical information available to derive availability figures. Examples of such information include census data, data from local job service offices, and data from colleges or other training institutions.

(e) The contractor may not draw its reasonable recruitment area in such a way as to have the effect of excluding minorities or women. For each job group, the reasonable recruitment area must be identified, with a brief explanation of the rationale for selection of that recruitment area.

(f) The contractor may not define the pool of promotable, transferable, and trainable employees in such a way as to have the effect of excluding minorities or women. For each job group, the pool of promotable, transferable, and trainable employees must be identified with a brief explanation of the rationale for the selection of that pool.

(g) Where a job group is composed of job titles with different availability rates, a composite availability figure for the job group must be calculated. The contractor must separately determine the availability for each job title within the job group and must determine the proportion of job group incumbents employed in each job title. The contractor must weight the availability for each job title by the proportion of job group incumbents employed in that job group. The sum of the weighted availability estimates for all job titles in the job group must be the composite availability for the job group.

###### § 60-2.15 Comparing incumbency to availability.

(a) The contractor must compare the percentage of minorities and women in each job group determined pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.13 with the availability for those job groups determined pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.14.

(b) When the percentage of minorities or women employed in a particular job group is less than would reasonably be expected given their availability percentage in that particular job group, the contractor must establish a placement goal in accordance with § 60&#x2013;2.16.

###### § 60-2.16 Placement goals.

(a) Purpose: Placement goals serve as objectives or targets reasonably attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all aspects of the entire affirmative action program work. Placement goals also are used to measure progress toward achieving equal employment opportunity.

(b) A contractor's determination under § 60&#x2013;2.15 that a placement goal is required constitutes neither a finding nor an admission of discrimination.

(c) Where, pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.15, a contractor is required to establish a placement goal for a particular job group, the contractor must establish a percentage annual placement goal at least equal to the availability figure derived for women or minorities, as appropriate, for that job group.

(d) The placement goal-setting process described above contemplates that contractors will, where required, establish a single goal for all minorities. In the event of a substantial disparity in the utilization of a particular minority group or in the utilization of men or women of a particular minority group, a contractor may be required to establish separate goals for those groups.

(e) In establishing placement goals, the following principles also apply:

(1) Placement goals may not be rigid and inflexible quotas, which must be met, nor are they to be considered as either a ceiling or a floor for the employment of particular groups. Quotas are expressly forbidden.

(2) In all employment decisions, the contractor must make selections in a nondiscriminatory manner. Placement goals do not provide the contractor with a justification to extend a preference to any individual, select an individual, or adversely affect an individual's employment status, on the basis of that person's race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

(3) Placement goals do not create set-asides for specific groups, nor are they intended to achieve proportional representation or equal results.

(4) Placement goals may not be used to supersede merit selection principles. Affirmative action programs prescribed by the regulations in this part do not require a contractor to hire a person who lacks qualifications to perform the job successfully, or hire a less qualified person in preference to a more qualified one.

(f) A contractor extending a publicly announced preference for American Indians as is authorized in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.5(a)(6) may reflect in its placement goals the permissive employment preference for American Indians living on or near an Indian reservation.

###### § 60-2.17 Additional required elements of affirmative action programs.

In addition to the elements required by § 60&#x2013;2.10 through § 60&#x2013;2.16, an acceptable affirmative action program must include the following:

(a)The contractor must provide for the implementation of equal employment opportunity and the affirmative action program by assigning responsibility and accountability to an official of the organization. Depending upon the size of the contractor, this may be the official's sole responsibility. He or she must have the authority, resources, support of and access to top management to ensure the effective implementation of the affirmative action program.

(b)The contractor must perform in-depth analyses of its total employment process to determine whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. At a minimum the contractor must evaluate:

(1) The workforce by organizational unit and job group to determine whether there are problems of minority or female utilization (employment in the unit or group), or of minority or female distribution (placement in the different jobs within the unit or group);

(2) Personnel activity (applicant flow, hires, terminations, promotions, and other personnel actions) to determine whether there are selection disparities;

(3) Compensation system(s) to determine whether there are gender-, race-, or ethnicity-based disparities;

(4) Selection, recruitment, referral, and other personnel procedures to determine whether they result in disparities in the employment or advancement of minorities or women; and

(5) Any other areas that might impact the success of the affirmative action program.

(c)The contractor must develop and execute action-oriented programs designed to correct any problem areas identified pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.17(b) and to attain established goals and objectives. In order for these action-oriented programs to be effective, the contractor must ensure that they consist of more than following the same procedures which have previously produced inadequate results. Furthermore, a contractor must demonstrate that it has made good faith efforts to remove identified barriers, expand employment opportunities, and produce measurable results.

(d)The contractor must develop and implement an auditing system that periodically measures the effectiveness of its total affirmative action program. The actions listed below are key to a successful affirmative action program:

(1) Monitor records of all personnel activity, including referrals, placements, transfers, promotions, terminations, and compensation, at all levels to ensure the nondiscriminatory policy is carried out;

(2) Require internal reporting on a scheduled basis as to the degree to which equal employment opportunity and organizational objectives are attained;

(3) Review report results with all levels of management; and

(4) Advise top management of program effectiveness and submit recommendations to improve unsatisfactory performance.

###### § 60-2.18 [Reserved]

##### Subpart C - Miscellaneous

###### § 60-2.30 Corporate management compliance evaluations.

(a) Purpose. Corporate Management Compliance Evaluations are designed to ascertain whether individuals are encountering artificial barriers to advancement into mid-level and senior corporate management,glass ceiling. During Corporate Management Compliance Evaluations, special attention is given to those components of the employment process that affect advancement into mid-and senior-level positions.

(b) If, during the course of a Corporate Management Compliance Evaluation, it comes to the attention of OFCCP that problems exist at establishments outside the corporate headquarters, OFCCP may expand the compliance evaluation beyond the headquarters establishment. At its discretion, OFCCP may direct its attention to and request relevant data for any and all areas within the corporation to ensure compliance with Executive Order 11246.

###### § 60-2.31 Program summary.

The affirmative action program must be summarized and updated annually. The program summary must be prepared in a format which will be prescribed by the Director and published in theas a notice before becoming effective. Contractors and subcontractors must submit the program summary to OFCCP each year on the anniversary date of the affirmative action program.

###### § 60-2.32 Affirmative action records.

The contractor must make available to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, upon request, records maintained pursuant to § 60&#x2013;1.12 of this chapter and written or otherwise documented portions of AAPs maintained pursuant to § 60&#x2013;2.10 for such purposes as may be appropriate to the fulfillment of the agency's responsibilities under Executive Order 11246.

###### § 60-2.33 Preemption.

To the extent that any state or local laws, regulations or ordinances, including those that grant special benefits to persons on account of sex, are in conflict with Executive Order 11246, as amended, or with the requirements of this part, they will be regarded as preempted under the Executive Order.

###### § 60-2.34 Supersedure.

All orders, instructions, regulations, and memorandums of the Secretary of Labor, other officials of the Department of Labor and contracting agencies are hereby superseded to the extent that they are inconsistent with this part 60&#x2013;2.

###### § 60-2.35 Compliance status.

No contractor's compliance status will be judged alone by whether it reaches its goals. The composition of the contractor's workforce (, the employment of minorities or women at a percentage rate below, or above, the goal level) does not, by itself, serve as a basis to impose any of the sanctions authorized by Executive Order 11246 and the regulations in this chapter. Each contractor's compliance with its affirmative action obligations will be determined by reviewing the nature and extent of the contractor's good faith affirmative action activities as required under § 60&#x2013;2.17, and the appropriateness of those activities to identified equal employment opportunity problems. Each contractor's compliance with its nondiscrimination obligations will be determined by analysis of statistical data and other non-statistical information which would indicate whether employees and applicants are being treated without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

##### § 60-4.4 Affirmative action requirements.

(a) To implement the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246 in the construction industry, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs previously has approved affirmative action programs commonly referred to as “Hometown Plans,” has promulgated affirmative action plans referred to as “Imposed Plans” and has approved “Special Bid Conditions” for high impact projects constructed in areas not covered by a Hometown or an Imposed Plan. All solicitations for construction contracts made after the effective date of the regulations in this part shall include the notice specified in § 60&#x2013;4.2 of this part and the specifications in § 60&#x2013;4.3 of this part in lieu of the Hometown and Imposed Plans including the Philadelphia Plan and Special Bid Conditions. Until the Director has issued an order pursuant to § 60&#x2013;4.6 of this part establishing goals and timetables for minorities in the appropriate geographical areas or for a project covered by Special Bid Conditions, the goals and timetables for minorities to be inserted in the Notice required by 41 CFR 60&#x2013;4.2 shall be the goals and timetables contained in the Hometown Plan, Imposed Plan or Special Bid Conditions presently covering the respective geographical area or project involved.

(b) Signatories to a Hometown Plan (including heavy highway affirmative action plans) shall have 45 days from the effective date of the regulations in this part to submit under such a Plan (for the director's approval) goals and timetables for women and to include female representation on the Hometown Plan Administrative Committee. Such goals for female representation shall be at least as high as the goals established for female representation in the notice issued pursuant to 41 CFR 60&#x2013;4.6. Failure of the signatories, within the 45-day period, to include female representation and to submit goals for women or a new plan, as appropriate, shall result in an automatic termination of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program's approval of the Hometown Plan. At any time the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs terminates or withdraws its approval of a Hometown Plan, or when the plan expires and another plan is not approved, the contractors signatory to the plan shall be covered automatically by the specifications set forth in § 60&#x2013;4.3 of this part and by the goals and timetables established for that geographical area pursuant to § 60&#x2013;4.6 of this part.

##### § 60-4.5 Hometown plans.

(a) A contractor participating, either individually or through an association, in an approved Hometown Plan (including heavy highway affirmative action plans) shall comply with its affirmative action obligations under Executive Order 11246 by complying with its obligations under the plan:That each contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved plan is individually required to comply with the equal opportunity clause set forth in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.4; to make a good faith effort to achieve the goals for each trade participating in the plan in which it has employees; and that the overall good performance by other contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan does not excuse any covered contractor's or subcontractor's failure to take good faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals and timetables. If a contractor is not participating in an approved Hometown Plan it shall comply with the specifications set forth in § 60&#x2013;4.3 of this part and with the goals and timetables for the appropriate area as listed in the notice required by 41 CFR 60&#x2013;4.2 with regard to that trade. For the purposes of this part 60&#x2013;4, a contractor is not participating in a Hometown Plan for a particular trade if it:

(1) Ceases to be signatory to a Hometown Plan covering that trade;

(2) Is signatory to a Hometown Plan for that trade but is not party to a collective bargaining agreement for that trade;

(3) Is signatory to a Hometown Plan for that trade but is party to a collective bargaining agreement with labor organizations which are not or cease to be signatories to the same Hometown Plan for that trade;

(4) Is signatory to a Hometown Plan for that trade but is party to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization for that trade but the two have not jointly executed a specific commitment to minority and female goals and timetables and incorporated the commitment in the Hometown Plan for that trade;

(5) Is participating in a Hometown Plan for that trade which is no longer acceptable to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;

(6) Is signatory to a Hometown Plan for that trade but is party to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization for that trade and the labor organization and the contractor have failed to make a good faith effort to comply with their obligations under the Hometown Plan for that trade.

(b) Contractors participating in Hometown Plans must be able to demonstrate their participation and document their compliance with the provision of the Hometown Plan.

##### § 60-4.6 Goals and timetables.

The Director, from time to time, shall issue goals and timetables for minority and female utilization which shall be based on appropriate workforce, demographic or other relevant data and which shall cover construction projects or construction contracts performed in specific geographical areas. The goals, which shall be applicable to each construction trade in a covered contractor's or subcontractor's entire workforce which is working in the area covered by the goals and timetables, shall be published as notices in theand shall be inserted by the contracting officers and applicants, as applicable, in the Notice required by 41 CFR 60&#x2013;4.2. Covered construction contractors performing construction work in geographical areas where they do not have a Federal or federally assisted construction contract shall apply the minority and female goals established for the geographical area where the work is being performed.

##### § 60-4.7 Effect on other regulations.

The regulations in this part are in addition to the regulations contained in this chapter which apply to construction contractors and subcontractors generally. See particularly, 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.4 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e); 60&#x2013;1.5; 60&#x2013;1.7; 60&#x2013;1.8; 60&#x2013;1.26; 60&#x2013;1.29; 60&#x2013;1.30; 60&#x2013;1.32; 60&#x2013;1.41; 60&#x2013;1.42; 60&#x2013;1.43; and 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;3; part 60&#x2013;20; part 60&#x2013;30; part 60&#x2013;40; and part 60&#x2013;50.

##### § 60-4.8 Show cause notice.

If an investigation or compliance review reveals that a construction contractor or subcontractor has violated the Executive order, any contract clause, specifications or the regulations in this chapter and if administrative enforcement is contemplated, the Director shall issue to the contractor or subcontractor a notice to show cause which shall contain the items specified in paragraphs (i) through (iv) of 41 CFR 60&#x2013;2.2(c)(1). If the contractor does not show good cause within 30 days, or in the alternative, fails to enter an acceptable conciliation agreement which includes where appropriate, make up goals and timetables, back pay, and seniority relief for affected class members, the OFCCP shall follow the procedure in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;1.26(b):That where a conciliation agreement has been violated, no show cause notice is required prior to the initiation of enforcement proceedings.

##### § 60-4.9 Incorporation by operation of the order.

By operation of the order, the equal opportunity clause contained in § 60&#x2013;1.4, the Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity (Executive Order 11246) contained in § 60&#x2013;4.2, and the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications (Executive Order 11246) contained in § 60&#x2013;4.3 shall be deemed to be a part of every solicitation or of every contract and subcontract, as appropriate, required by the order and the regulations in this chapter to include such clauses whether or not they are physically incorporated in such solicitation or contract and whether or not the contract is written.

#### PART 60-20 - DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX

##### § 60-20.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to set forth specific requirements that covered Federal Government contractors and subcontractors, including those performing work under federally assisted construction contracts (“contractors”),must meet in fulfilling their obligations under Executive Order 11246, as amended, to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in employment. These regulations are to be read in conjunction with the other regulations implementing Executive Order 11246, as amended, set forth in parts 60&#x2013;1, 60&#x2013;2, 60&#x2013;3, 60&#x2013;4, and 60&#x2013;30 of this chapter. For instance, under no circumstances will a contractor's good faith efforts to comply with the affirmative action requirements of part 60&#x2013;2 of this chapter be considered a violation of this part.

##### § 60-20.2 General prohibitions.

(a)It is unlawful for a contractor to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of sex. The term sex includes, but is not limited to, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; gender identity; transgender status; and sex stereotyping.

(b)Unless sex is aoccupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of a contractor's particular business or enterprise, the contractor may not make any distinction based on sex in recruitment, hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, hours, job assignments, training, benefits, or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Such unlawful sex-based discriminatory practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Making a distinction between married and unmarried persons that is not applied equally to men and women;

(2) Denying women with children an employment opportunity that is available to men with children;

(3) Treating men and women differently with regard to the availability of flexible work arrangements;

(4) Firing, or otherwise treating adversely, unmarried women, but not unmarried men, who become parents;

(5) Applying different standards in hiring or promoting men and women on the basis of sex;

(6) Steering women into lower-paying or less desirable jobs on the basis of sex;

(7) Imposing any differences in retirement age or other terms, conditions, or privileges of retirement on the basis of sex;

(8) Restricting job classifications on the basis of sex;

(9) Maintaining seniority lines and lists on the basis of sex;

(10) Recruiting or advertising for individuals for certain jobs on the basis of sex;

(11) Distinguishing on the basis of sex in apprenticeship or other formal or informal training programs; in other opportunities such as on-the-job training, networking, mentoring, sponsorship, individual development plans, rotational assignments, and succession planning programs; or in performance appraisals that may provide the basis of subsequent opportunities;

(12) Making any facilities and employment-related activities available only to members of one sex, except that if the contractor provides restrooms, changing rooms, showers, or similar facilities, the contractor must provide same-sex or single-user facilities;

(13) Denying transgender employees access to the restrooms, changing rooms, showers, or similar facilities designated for use by the gender with which they identify; and

(14) Treating employees or applicants adversely because they have received, are receiving, or are planning to receive transition-related medical services designed to facilitate the adoption of a sex or gender other than the individual's designated sex at birth.

(c)Employment policies or practices that have an adverse impact on the basis of sex, and are not job-related and consistent with business necessity, violate Executive Order 11246, as amended, and this part. Examples of policies or practices that may violate Executive Order 11246 in terms of their disparate impact on the basis of sex include, but are not limited to:

(1) Height and/or weight qualifications that are not necessary to the performance of the job and that negatively impact women substantially more than men;

(2) Strength, agility, or other physical requirements that exceed the actual requirements necessary to perform the job in question and that negatively impact women substantially more than men;

(3) Conditioning entry into an apprenticeship or training program on performance on a written test, interview, or other selection procedure that has an adverse impact on women where the contractor cannot establish the validity of the selection procedure consistent with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;3; and

(4) Relying on recruitment or promotion methods, such as “word-of-mouth” recruitment or “tap-on-the-shoulder” promotion, that have an adverse impact on women where the contractor cannot establish that they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.

##### § 60-20.3 Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.

Contractors may not hire and employ employees on the basis of sex unless sex is aoccupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the contractor's particular business or enterprise.

##### § 60-20.4 Discriminatory compensation.

Compensation may not be based on sex. Contractors may not engage in any employment practice that discriminates in wages, benefits, or any other forms of compensation, or denies access to earnings opportunities, because of sex, on either an individual or systemic basis, including, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Contractors may not pay different compensation to similarly situated employees on the basis of sex. For purposes of evaluating compensation differences, the determination of similarly situated employees is case-specific. Relevant factors in determining similarity may include tasks performed, skills, effort, levels of responsibility, working conditions, job difficulty, minimum qualifications, and other objective factors. In some cases, employees are similarly situated where they are comparable on some of these factors, even if they are not similar on others.

(b) Contractors may not grant or deny higher-paying wage rates, salaries, positions, job classifications, work assignments, shifts, development opportunities, or other opportunities on the basis of sex. Contractors may not grant or deny training, apprenticeships, work assignments, or other opportunities that may lead to advancement to higher-paying positions on the basis of sex.

(c) Contractors may not provide or deny earnings opportunities because of sex, for example, by denying women equal opportunity to obtain regularand/or overtime hours, commissions, pay increases, incentive compensation, or any other additions to regular earnings.

(d) Contractors may not implement compensation practices that have an adverse impact on the basis of sex and are not shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.

(e) A contractor will be in violation of Executive Order 11246 and this part any time it pays wages, benefits, or other compensation that is the result in whole or in part of the application of any discriminatory compensation decision or other practice.

##### § 60-20.5 Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

(a)&#x2014;(1) Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, including childbearing capacity, is a form of unlawful sex discrimination. Contractors must treat people of childbearing capacity and those affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe-benefit programs, as other persons not so affected, but similar in their ability or inability to work.

(2) Related medical conditions include, but are not limited to, lactation; disorders directly related to pregnancy, such as preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure), placenta previa, and gestational diabetes; symptoms such as back pain; complications requiring bed rest; and the after-effects of a delivery.

(b)Examples of unlawful pregnancy discrimination include, but are not limited to:

(1) Refusing to hire pregnant people or people of childbearing capacity, or otherwise subjecting such applicants or employees to adverse employment treatment, because of their pregnancy or childbearing capacity;

(2) Firing female employees or requiring them to go on leave because they become pregnant or have a child;

(3) Limiting pregnant employees' job duties based solely on the fact that they are pregnant, or requiring a doctor's note in order for a pregnant employee to continue working; and

(4) Providing employees with health insurance that does not cover hospitalization and other medical costs for pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions to the same extent that hospitalization and other medical costs are covered for other medical conditions.

(c)&#x2014;(1)It is a violation of Executive Order 11246 for a contractor to deny alternative job assignments, modified duties, or other accommodations to employees who are unable to perform some of their job duties because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions where:

(i) The contractor denies such assignments, modifications, or other accommodations only to employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions;

(ii) The contractor provides, or is required by its policy or by other relevant laws to provide, such assignments, modifications, or other accommodations to other employees whose abilities or inabilities to perform their job duties are similarly affected, and the denial of accommodations imposes a significant burden on employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions and the contractor's asserted reasons for denying accommodations to such employees do not justify that burden; or

(iii) Intent to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions is otherwise shown.

(2)Contractors that have policies or practices that deny alternative job assignments, modified duties, or other accommodations to employees who are unable to perform some of their job duties because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions must ensure that such policies or practices do not have an adverse impact on the basis of sex unless they are shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. For example, where a contractor's policy of offering light duty only to employees with on-the-job injuries has an adverse impact on employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, the policy would be impermissible unless shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.

(d)&#x2014;(1)To the extent that a contractor provides family, medical, or other leave, such leave must not be denied or provided differently on the basis of sex.

(2)(i) A contractor must provide job-guaranteed medical leave, including paid sick leave, for employees' pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions on the same terms that medical or sick leave is provided for medical conditions that are similar in their effect on employees' ability to work.

(ii) A contractor must provide job-guaranteed family leave, including any paid leave, for male employees on the same terms that family leave is provided for female employees.

(3)Contractors that have employment policies or practices under which insufficient or no medical or family leave is available must ensure that such policies or practices do not have an adverse impact on the basis of sex unless they are shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.

##### § 60-20.6 Other fringe benefits.

(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for a contractor to discriminate on the basis of sex with regard to fringe benefits.

(b) As used herein, the term “fringe benefits” includes, but is not limited to, medical, hospital, accident, life insurance, and retirement benefits; profit-sharing and bonus plans; leave; and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.

(c) The greater cost of providing a fringe benefit to members of one sex is not a defense to a contractor's failure to provide benefits equally to members of both sexes.

##### § 60-20.7 Employment decisions made on the basis of sex-based stereotypes.

Contractors must not make employment decisions on the basis of sex-based stereotypes, such as stereotypes about how males and/or females are expected to look, speak, or act. Such employment decisions are a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Executive Order 11246, as amended. Examples of discrimination based on sex-based stereotyping may include, but are not limited to:

(a) Adverse treatment of an employee or applicant for employment because of that individual's failure to comply with gender norms and expectations for dress, appearance, and/or behavior, such as:

(1) Failing to promote a woman, or otherwise subjecting her to adverse employment treatment, based on sex stereotypes about dress, including wearing jewelry, make-up, or high heels;

(2) Harassing a man because he is considered effeminate or insufficiently masculine; or

(3) Treating employees or applicants adversely based on their sexual orientation where the evidence establishes that the discrimination is based on gender stereotypes;

(b) Adverse treatment of employees or applicants because of their actual or perceived gender identity or transgender status;

(c) Adverse treatment of a female employee or applicant because she does not conform to a sex stereotype about women working in a particular job, sector, or industry; and

(d) Adverse treatment of employees or applicants based on sex-based stereotypes about caregiver responsibilities. For example, adverse treatment of a female employee because of a sex-based assumption that she has (or will have) family caretaking responsibilities, and that those responsibilities will interfere with her work performance, is discrimination based on sex. Other examples of such discriminatory treatment include, but are not limited to:

(1) Adverse treatment of a male employee because he has taken or is planning to take leave to care for his newborn or recently adopted or foster child based on the sex-stereotyped belief that women and not men should care for children;

(2) Denying opportunities to mothers of children based on the sex-stereotyped belief that women with children should not or will not work long hours, regardless of whether the contractor is acting out of hostility or belief that it is acting in the employee's or her children's best interest;

(3) Evaluating the performance of female employees who have family caregiving responsibilities adversely, based on the sex-based stereotype that women are less capable or skilled than their male counterparts who do not have such responsibilities; and

#### PART 60-30 - RULES OF PRACTICE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 11246

#### PART 60-40 - EXAMINATION AND COPYING OF OFCCP DOCUMENTS

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 60-40.1 Purpose and scope.

This part contains the general rules of the OFCCP providing for public access to information from records of the OFCCP or its various compliance agencies. These regulations implement 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act and supplement the policy and regulations of the Department of Labor, 29 CFR part 70. It is the policy of the OFCCP to disclose information to the public and to cooperate with other public agencies as well as private parties seeking to eliminate discrimination in employment. This part sets forth generally the categories of records accessible to the public, the types of records subject to prohibitions or restrictions on disclosure, and the places at which and the procedures whereby members of the public may obtain access to and inspect and copy information from records in the custody of the OFCCP.

###### § 60-40.2 Information available on request.

(a) Upon the request of any person for identifiable records obtained or generated pursuant to Executive Order 11246 (as amended) such records shall be made available for inspection and copying, notwithstanding the applicability of the exemption from mandatory disclosure set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552 subsection (b), if it is determined that the requested inspection or copying furthers the public interest and does not impede any of the functions of the OFCCP, except in the case of records disclosure of which is prohibited by law.

(b) Consistent with the above, all contract compliance documents within the custody of the OFCCP shall be disclosed upon request unless specifically prohibited by law or as limited elsewhere herein. The types of documents which if in the custody of the OFCCP must be disclosed include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Affirmative action plans, whether or not reviewed and finally accepted by the OFCCP except as limited in 41 CFR 60&#x2013;40.3(a)(1).

(2) Imposed plans and hometown plans, pending or approved.

(3) Text of final conciliation agreements.

(4) Validation studies of tests or other preemployment selection methods.

(5) Dates and times of scheduled compliance reviews.

###### § 60-40.3 Information exempt from compulsory disclosure and which may be withheld.

(a) The following documents or parts thereof are exempt from mandatory disclosure by the OFCCP, and should be withheld if it is determined that the requested inspection or copying does not further the public interest and might impede the discharge of any of the functions of the OFCCP.

(1) Those portions of affirmative action plans such as goals and timetables which would be confidential commercial or financial information because they indicate, and only to the extent that they indicate, that a contractor plans major shifts or changes in his personnel requirements and he has not made this information available to the public. A determination to withhold this type of information should be made only after receiving verification and a satisfactory explanation from the contractor that the information should be withheld.

(2) Those portions of affirmative action plans which constitute information on staffing patterns and pay scales but only to the extent that their release would injure the business or financial position of the contractor, would constitute a release of confidential financial information of an employee or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an employee.

(3) The names of individual complainants.

(4) The assignments to particular contractors of named compliance officers if such disclosure would subject the named compliance officers to undue harassment or would affect the efficient enforcement of the Executive order.

(5) Compliance investigation files including the standard compliance review report and related documents, during the course of the review to which they pertain or while enforcement action against the contractor is in progress or contemplated within a reasonable time. Therefore, these reports and related files shall not be disclosed only to the extent that information contained therein constitutes trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information, inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the agency, personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, data which would be exempt from mandatory disclosure pursuant to the “informants privilege” or such information the disclosure of which is prohibited by statute.

(6) Copies of preemployment selection tests used by contractors.

(b) Other records may be withheld consistent with the Freedom of Information Act on a case-by-case basis, with the prior approval of the Director, OFCCP.

###### § 60-40.4 Information disclosure of which is prohibited by law.

The Standard Form 100 (EEO&#x2013;1) which is submitted by contractors to the OFCCP or a Joint Reporting Committee servicing both the OFCCP and the EEOC shall be disclosed pending further instructions from the Director. The statutory prohibition on disclosure set forth in section 709(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is limited by the terms of that section to information obtained pursuant to the authority of title VII of that Act and its disclosure by employees of the EEOC.

##### Subpart B - Procedures for Disclosure

###### § 60-40.5 Applicability of procedures.

Requests for the inspection and copying of information from records in the custody of the OFCCP which are identifiable and available under the provisions of subpart A of this part shall be made and acted upon as provided in the following sections of this subpart. Officers and employees of the OFCCP are authorized by the Director to continue to furnish to the public, informally and without compliance with these procedures, information and copies from its records which prior to the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) were customarily furnished in the regular performance of their duties.

###### § 60-40.6 To whom to direct requests.

A request for contract compliance records or information shall be directed to the National OFCCP or appropriate OFCCP Regional or Area Office. If the person making the request does not know in which office the record is located, he may direct his request to the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210, for appropriate handling.

###### § 60-40.7 Partial disclosure.

If a requested record contains some materials which are protected from disclosure and other materials which are not so protected, identifying details or protected matters shall be deleted wherever analysis indicates that such deletions are feasible. Whenever such deletions are made, the remainder of the records may be disclosed.

###### § 60-40.8 Facilities and procedures for disclosure.

(a) [Reserved]

(b) Procedures relating to the avaliability of records shall be governed by the Department of Labor regulations, 29 CFR 70.35 to 70.64.

#### PART 60-50 - GUIDELINES ON DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF RELIGION OR NATIONAL ORIGIN

##### § 60-50.1 Purpose and scope.

(a) The purpose of the provisions in this part is to set forth the interpretations and guidelines of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regarding the implementation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, for promoting and insuring equal employment opportunities for all persons employed or seeking employment with Government contractors and subcontractors or with contractors and subcontractors performing under federally assisted construction contracts, without regard to religion or national origin.

(b) Members of various religious and ethnic groups, primarily but not exclusively of Eastern, Middle, and Southern European ancestry, such as Jews, Catholics, Italians, Greeks, and Slavic groups, continue to be excluded from executive, middle-management, and other job levels because of discrimination based upon their religion and/or national origin. These guidelines are intended to remedy such unfair treatment.

(c) These guidelines are also intended to clarify the obligations of employers with respect to accommodating to the religious observances and practices of employees and prospective employees.

(d) The employment problems of blacks, Spanish-surnamed Americans, orientals, and American Indians are treated under part 60&#x2013;2 of this chapter and under other regulations and procedures implementing the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended. Accordingly, the remedial provisions of § 60&#x2013;50.2(b) shall not be applicable to the employment problems of these groups.

(e) Nothing contained in this part 60&#x2013;50 is intended to supersede or otherwise limit the exemption set forth in § 60&#x2013;1.5(a)(5) of this chapter for contracts with certain educational institutions.

##### § 60-50.2 Equal employment policy.

(a)Under the equal opportunity clause contained in section 202 of Executive Order 11246, as amended, employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees or applicants for employment because of religion or national origin, and must take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their religion or national origin. Such action includes, but is not limited to the following: Employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer: Recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

(b)Employers shall review their employment practices to determine whether members of the various religious and/or ethnic groups are receiving fair consideration for job opportunities. Special attention shall be directed toward executive and middle-management levels, where employment problems relating to religion and national origin are most likely to occur. Based upon the findings of such reviews, employers shall undertake appropriate outreach and positive recruitment activities, such as those listed below, in order to remedy existing deficiencies. It is not contemplated that employers necessarily will undertake all of the listed activities. The scope of the employer's efforts shall depend upon all the circumstances, including the nature and extent of the employer's deficiencies and the employer's size and resources.

(1) Internal communication of the employer's obligation to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to religion or national origin in such a manner as to foster understanding, acceptance, and support among the employer's executive, management, supervisory, and all other employees and to encourage such persons to take the necessary action to aid the employer in meeting this obligation.

(2) Development of reasonable internal procedures to insure that the employer's obligation to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to religion or national origin is being fully implemented.

(3) Periodically informing all employees of the employer's commitment to equal employment opportunity for all persons, without regard to religion or national origin.

(4) Enlisting the assistance and support of all recruitment sources (including employment agencies, college placement directors, and business associates) for the employer's commitment to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to religion or national origin.

(5) Reviewing employment records to determine the availability of promotable and transferable members of various religious and ethnic groups.

(6) Establishment of meaningful contacts with religious and ethnic organizations and leaders for such purposes as advice, education, technical assistance, and referral of potential employees.

(7) Engaging in significant recruitment activities at educational institutions with substantial enrollments of students from various religious and ethnic groups.

(8) Use of the religious and ethnic media for institutional and employment advertising.

##### § 60-50.3 Accommodations to religious observance and practice.

An employer must accommodate to the religious observances and practices of an employee or prospective employee unless the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. As part of this obligation, an employer must make reasonable accommodations to the religious observances and practices of an employee or prospective employee who regularly observes Friday evening and Saturday, or some other day of the week, as his Sabbath and/or who observes certain religious holidays during the year and who is conscientiously opposed to performing work or engaging in similar activity on such days, when such accommodations can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. In determining the extent of an employer's obligations under this section, at least the following factors shall be considered: (a) Business necessity, (b) financial costs and expenses, and (c) resulting personnel problems.

##### § 60-50.4 Enforcement.

The provisions of this part are subject to the general enforcement, compliance review, and complaint procedures set forth in subpart B of part 60&#x2013;1 of this chapter.

##### § 60-50.5 Nondiscrimination.

The provisions of this part are not intended and shall not be used to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.

#### PART 60-300 - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND NONDISCRIMINATION OBLIGATIONS OF FEDERAL CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS REGARDING DISABLED VETERANS, RECENTLY SEPARATED VETERANS, ACTIVE DUTY WARTIME OR CAMPAIGN BADGE VETERANS, AND ARMED FORCES SERVICE MEDAL VETERANS

##### Subpart A - Preliminary Matters, Equal Opportunity Clause

###### § 60-300.1 Purpose, applicability and construction.

(a)The purpose of the regulations in this part is to set forth the standards for compliance with the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, 38 U.S.C. 4212, (VEVRAA), which prohibits discrimination against protected veterans and pre-JVA veterans as defined in this part, and requires Government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans.

Disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans, and Armed Forces service medal veterans are protected veterans under VEVRAA.

(b)This part applies to any Government contract or subcontract of $100,000 or more, entered into or modified on or after December 1, 2003, for the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services (including construction): Provided, that subpart C of this part applies only as described in § 60&#x2013;300.40(a); and that the non-discrimination protections in § 60&#x2013;300.21 and the right to file complaints alleging discriminatory conduct set forth in § 60&#x2013;300.61 also apply to “pre-JVA veterans” as defined in § 60&#x2013;300.2, who are applicants or employees of a contractor with a Government contract of $25,000 or more entered into prior to December 1, 2003, and unmodified since to a contract amount of $100,000. Compliance by the contractor with the provisions of this part will not necessarily determine its compliance with other statutes, and compliance with other statutes will not necessarily determine its compliance with this part.

(c)&#x2014;(1)The Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. 12101,) set out as an appendix to 29 CFR part 1630 issued pursuant to Title I may be relied upon for guidance in interpreting the parallel provisions of this part.

(2)This part does not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures under any Federal law or the law of any state or political subdivision that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans, or Armed Forces service medal protected veterans as compared to the protection afforded by this part. It may be a defense to a charge of violation of this part that a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that another Federal law or regulation prohibits an action (including the provision of a particular reasonable accommodation) that would otherwise be required by this part.

(i)This part does not invalidate or limit the obligations, responsibilities, and requirements of the contractor pursuant to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (38 U.S.C. 4301,). This includes the obligation under USERRA to reemploy employees of the contractor following qualifying service in the uniformed services in the position the employee would have obtained with reasonable certainty had the employee been continuously employed during the period of uniformed service. Compliance by the contractor with the provisions of this part will not necessarily determine its compliance with USERRA, and compliance with USERRA will not necessarily determine its compliance with this part.

Once the equal opportunity clause is determined to be applicable, the contract shall continue to be subject to such clause for its duration, regardless of the amounts ordered, or reasonably expected to be ordered in any year.

(3)This part applies only to employment activities within the United States and not to employment activities abroad. The term “employment activities within the United States” includes actual employment within the United States, and decisions of the contractor made within the United States pertaining to the contractor's applicants and employees who are within the United States, regarding employment opportunities abroad (such as recruiting and hiring within the United States for employment abroad, or transfer of persons employed in the United States to contractor establishments abroad).

(4)The requirements of the equal opportunity clause in any contract or subcontract with a State or local government (or any agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof) shall not be applicable to any agency, instrumentality or subdivision of such government which does not participate in work on or under the contract or subcontract.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The Director may waive the application to any contract of the equal opportunity clause in whole or part when he or she deems that special circumstances in the national interest so require. The Director may also grant such waivers to groups or categories of contracts: Where it is in the national interest; where it is found impracticable to act upon each request individually; and where such waiver will substantially contribute to convenience in administration of the Act. When a waiver has been granted for any class of contracts, the Director may withdraw the waiver for a specific contract or group of contracts to be awarded, when in his or her judgment such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the Act. The withdrawal shall not apply to contracts awarded prior to the withdrawal, except that in procurements entered into by formal advertising, or the various forms of restricted formal advertising, such withdrawal shall not apply unless the withdrawal is made more than 10 calendar days before the date set for the opening of the bids.

(2)Any requirement set forth in the regulations of this part shall not apply to any contract whenever the head of the contracting agency determines that such contract is essential to the national security and that its award without complying with such requirements is necessary to the national security. Upon making such a determination, the head of the contracting agency will notify the Director in writing within 30 days.

(3)The Director may waive the requirements of the equal opportunity clause with respect to any of a contractor's facilities which he or she finds to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the contractor related to the performance of the contract, provided that he or she also finds that such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the Act. Such waivers shall be considered only upon the request of the contractor.

###### § 60-300.5 Equal opportunity clause.

(a)Each contracting agency and each contractor shall include the following equal opportunity clause in each of its covered Government contracts or subcontracts (and modifications, renewals, or extensions thereof if not included in the original contract):

(b)Each contractor shall include the equal opportunity clause in each of its subcontracts subject to this part.

(c)Such necessary changes in language may be made to the equal opportunity clause as must be appropriate to identify properly the parties and their undertakings.

(d)It is not necessary to include the equal opportunity clause verbatim in the contract. The clause shall be made a part of the contract by citation to 41 CFR 60&#x2013;300.5(a) and inclusion of the following language, in bold text, after the citation:

(e)By operation of the Act, the equal opportunity clause shall be considered to be a part of every contract and subcontract required by the Act and the regulations in this part to include such a clause, whether or not it is physically incorporated in such contract and whether or not there is a written contract between the agency and the contractor.

(f)Each contracting agency shall cooperate with the Director and the Secretary in the performance of their responsibilities under the Act. Such cooperation shall include insuring that the equal opportunity clause is included in all covered Government contracts and that contractors are fully informed of their obligations under the Act and this part, providing the Director with any information which comes to the agency's attention that a contractor is not in compliance with the Act or this part, responding to requests for information from the Director, and taking such actions for noncompliance as are set forth in § 60&#x2013;300.66 as may be ordered by the Secretary or the Director.

##### Subpart B - Discrimination Prohibited

###### § 60-300.20 Covered employment activities.

The prohibition against discrimination in this part applies to the following employment activities:

(a) Recruitment, advertising, and job application procedures;

(b) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;

(c) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;

(d) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;

(e) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;

(f) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the contractor;

(g) Selection and financial support for training, including, apprenticeships, professional meetings, conferences and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;

(h) Activities sponsored by the contractor including social and recreational programs; and

(i) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.

###### § 60-300.21 Prohibitions.

The term discrimination includes, but is not limited to, the acts described in this section and § 60&#x2013;300.23.

(a)It is unlawful for the contractor to deny an employment opportunity or benefit or otherwise to discriminate against a qualified individual because of that individual's status as a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran.

(b)Unless otherwise permitted by this part, it is unlawful for the contractor to limit, segregate, or classify a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the basis of that individual's status as a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran. For example, the contractor may not segregate protected veterans as a whole, or any classification of protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans, into separate work areas or into separate lines of advancement.

(c)&#x2014;(1)It is unlawful for the contractor to participate in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting the contractor's own qualified applicant or employee who is a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran to the discrimination prohibited by this part.

(2)The phrase “contractual or other arrangement or relationship” includes, but is not limited to, a relationship with: an employment or referral agency; a labor organization, including a collective bargaining agreement; an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the contractor; or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs.

(3)This paragraph (c) applies to the contractor, with respect to its own applicants or employees, whether the contractor offered the contract or initiated the relationship, or whether the contractor accepted the contract or acceded to the relationship. The contractor is not liable for the actions of the other party or parties to the contract which only affect that other party's employees or applicants.

(d)It is unlawful for the contractor to use standards, criteria, or methods of administration, that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that:

(1) Have the effect of discriminating on the basis of status as a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran; or

(2) Perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control.

(e)It is unlawful for the contractor to exclude or deny equal jobs or benefits to, or otherwise discriminate against, a qualified individual because of the known protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran status of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social or other relationship or association.

(f)(1) It is unlawful for the contractor to fail to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is a qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran, unless such contractor can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.

(2) It is unlawful for the contractor to deny employment opportunities to an applicant or employee who is a qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran based on the need of such contractor to make reasonable accommodation to such an individual's physical or mental impairments.

(3) A qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran is not required to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity or benefit which such qualified individual chooses not to accept. However, if such individual rejects a reasonable accommodation, aid, service, opportunity or benefit that is necessary to enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, and cannot, as a result of that rejection, perform the essential functions of the position, the individual will not be considered a qualified disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran.

(g)&#x2014;(1)It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals on the basis of their status as protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans unless the standard, test or other selection criterion, as used by the contractor, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. Selection criteria that concern an essential function may not be used to exclude a disabled veteran if that individual could satisfy the criteria with provision of a reasonable accommodation. Selection criteria that exclude or tend to exclude individuals on the basis of their status as protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans but concern only marginal functions of the job would not be consistent with business necessity. The contractor may not refuse to hire an applicant who is a disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran because the applicant's disability prevents him or her from performing marginal functions. When considering a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran for an employment opportunity, the contractor may not rely on portions of such veteran's military record, including his or her discharge papers, which are not relevant to the qualification requirements of the opportunity in issue.

(2) The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;3, do not apply to 38 U.S.C. 4212 and are similarly inapplicable to this part.

(h)It is unlawful for the contractor to fail to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most effective manner to ensure that, when a test is administered to a job applicant or employee who is a disabled veteran or pre-JVA special disabled veteran with a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor of the applicant or employee that the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills of such employee or applicant, except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.

(i)In offering employment or promotions to protected veterans or pre-JVA veterans, it is unlawful for the contractor to reduce the amount of compensation offered because of any income based upon a disability-related and/or military-service-related pension or other disability-related and/or military-service-related benefit the applicant or employee receives from another source.

###### § 60-300.22 Direct threat defense.

The contractor may use as a qualification standard the requirement that an individual be able to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired without posing a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. (See § 60&#x2013;300.2(g) defining).

###### § 60-300.23 Medical examinations and inquiries.

(a)Except as stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, it is unlawful for the contractor to require a medical examination of an applicant or employee or to make inquiries as to whether an applicant or employee is a disabled veteran or as to the nature or severity of such a veteran's disability.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The contractor may make pre-employment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions, and/or may ask an applicant to describe or to demonstrate how, with or without reasonable accommodation, the applicant will be able to perform job-related functions.

(2)The contractor may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) after making an offer of employment to a job applicant and before the applicant begins his or her employment duties, and may condition an offer of employment on the results of such examination (and/or inquiry), if all entering employees in the same job category are subjected to such an examination (and/or inquiry) regardless of their status as a disabled veteran.

(3)The contractor may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) of an employee that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. The contractor may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.

(4)The contractor may conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, which are part of an employee health program available to employees at the work site.

(5) Medical examinations conducted in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section do not have to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. However, if certain criteria are used to screen out an applicant or applicants or an employee or employees who are disabled veterans as a result of such examinations or inquiries, the contractor must demonstrate that the exclusionary criteria are job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that performance of the essential job functions cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodations as required in this part.

(c)The contractor shall invite applicants to self-identify as being covered by the Act, as specified in § 60&#x2013;300.42.

(d)(1) Information obtained under this section regarding the medical condition or history of any applicant or employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and treated as a confidential medical record, except that:

(i) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the applicant or employee and necessary accommodations;

(ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and

(iii) Government officials engaged in enforcing the laws administered by OFCCP, including this part, or enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act, shall be provided relevant information on request.

(2) Information obtained under this section regarding the medical condition or history of any applicant or employee shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.

###### § 60-300.24 Drugs and alcohol.

(a)The contractor: (1) May prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol at the workplace by all employees;

(2) May require that employees not be under the influence of alcohol or be engaging in the illegal use of drugs at the workplace;

(3) May require that all employees behave in conformance with the requirements established under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701);

(4) May hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior to which the contractor holds its other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's drug use or alcoholism;

(5) May require that its employees employed in an industry subject to such regulations comply with the standards established in the regulations (if any) of the Departments of Defense and Transportation, and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other Federal agencies regarding alcohol and the illegal use of drugs; and

(6) May require that employees employed in sensitive positions comply with the regulations (if any) of the Departments of Defense and Transportation, and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other Federal agencies that apply to employment in sensitive positions subject to such regulations.

(b)&#x2014;(1)For purposes of this part, a test to determine the illegal use of drugs is not considered a medical examination. Thus, the administration of such drug tests by the contractor to its job applicants or employees is not a violation of § 60&#x2013;300.23. Nothing in this part shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the contractor to conduct drug tests of job applicants or employees to determine the illegal use of drugs or to make employment decisions based on such test results.

(2)Nothing in this part shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the otherwise lawful exercise by contractors subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation of authority to test employees in, and applicants for, positions involving safety-sensitive duties for the illegal use of drugs or for on-duty impairment by alcohol; and remove from safety-sensitive positions persons who test positive for illegal use of drugs or on-duty impairment by alcohol pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) Any information regarding the medical condition or history of any employee or applicant obtained from a test to determine the illegal use of drugs, except information regarding the illegal use of drugs, is subject to the requirements of §§ 60&#x2013;300.23(b)(5) and 60&#x2013;300.23(d)(2).

###### § 60-300.25 Health insurance, life insurance and other benefit plans.

(a) An insurer, hospital, or medical service company, health maintenance organization, or any agent or entity that administers benefit plans, or similar organizations may underwrite risks, classify risks, or administer such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with state law.

(b) The contractor may establish, sponsor, observe or administer the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with state law.

(c) The contractor may establish, sponsor, observe, or administer the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that is not subject to state laws that regulate insurance.

(d) The contractor shall not deny a qualified disabled veteran equal access to insurance or subject a qualified disabled veteran to different terms or conditions of insurance based on disability alone, if the disability does not pose increased risks.

(e) The activities described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section are permitted unless these activities are used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this part.

##### Subpart C - Affirmative Action Program

###### § 60-300.40 Applicability of the affirmative action program requirement.

(a) The requirements of this subpart apply to every Government contractor that has 50 or more employees and a contract of $100,000 or more.

(b) Contractors described in paragraph (a) of this section shall, within 120 days of the commencement of a contract, prepare and maintain an affirmative action program at each establishment. The affirmative action program shall set forth the contractor's policies and procedures in accordance with this part. This program may be integrated into or kept separate from other affirmative action programs.

(c) The affirmative action program shall be reviewed and updated annually by the official designated by the contractor pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.44(i).

(d) The contractor shall submit the affirmative action program within 30 days of a request from OFCCP, unless the request provides for a different time. The contractor also shall make the affirmative action program promptly available on-site upon OFCCP's request.

###### § 60-300.41 Availability of affirmative action program.

The full affirmative action program, absent the data metrics required by § 60&#x2013;300.44(k), shall be made available to any employee or applicant for employment for inspection upon request. The location and hours during which the program may be obtained shall be posted at each establishment.

###### § 60-300.42 Invitation to self-identify.

(a)The contractor shall invite applicants to inform the contractor whether the applicant believes that he or she is a protected veteran who may be covered by the Act. This invitation may be included in the application materials for the position, but in any circumstance shall be provided to applicants prior to making an offer of employment to a job applicant.

(b)In addition to the invitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the contractor shall invite applicants to inform the contractor whether the applicant believes that he or she belongs to one or more of the specific categories of protected veteran for which the contractor is required to report pursuant to 41 CFR part 61&#x2013;300. Such an invitation shall be made at any time after the offer of employment but before the applicant begins his or her job duties.

(c) The invitations referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall state that the contractor is a Federal contractor required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment protected veterans pursuant to the Act. The invitations also shall summarize the relevant portions of the Act and the contractor's affirmative action program. Furthermore, the invitations shall state that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will not be used in a manner inconsistent with the act. (An acceptable form for such an invitation is set forth in appendix B of this part.)

(d) If an applicant identifies himself or herself as a disabled veteran in the post-offer self-identification detailed in paragraph (b) of this section, the contractor should inquire of the applicant whether an accommodation is necessary, and if so, should engage with the applicant regarding reasonable accommodation. The contractor may make such inquiries to the extent they are consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101,The contractor shall maintain a separate file in accordance with § 60&#x2013;300.23(d) on persons who have self-identified as disabled veterans.

(e) The contractor shall keep all information on self-identification confidential. The contractor shall provide the information to OFCCP upon request. This information may be used only in accordance with this part.

(f) Nothing in this section relieves the contractor of its obligation to take affirmative action with respect to those applicants or employees who are known to the contractor to be protected veterans.

(g) Nothing in this section relieves the contractor from liability for discrimination under the Act.

###### § 60-300.43 Affirmative action policy.

Under the affirmative action obligations imposed by the Act, contractors shall not discriminate against protected veterans, and shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans at all levels of employment, including the executive level. Such action shall apply to all employment activities set forth in § 60&#x2013;300.20.

###### § 60-300.44 Required contents of affirmative action programs.

Acceptable affirmative action programs shall contain, but not necessarily be limited to, the following elements:

(a)The contractor shall include an equal opportunity policy statement in its affirmative action program, and shall post the policy statement on company bulletin boards. The contractor must ensure that applicants and employees who are disabled veterans are provided the notice in a form that is accessible and understandable to the disabled veteran (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice, or posting the notice for visual accessibility to persons in wheelchairs). The policy statement shall indicate the top United States executive's (such as the Chief Executive Officer or the President of the United States Division of a foreign company) support for the contractor's affirmative action program, provide for an audit and reporting system (see paragraph (h) of this section) and assign overall responsibility for the implementation of affirmative action activities required under this part (see paragraph (i) of this section). Additionally, the policy shall state, among other things, that the contractor will: recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles, and ensure that all other personnel actions are administered, without regard to protected veteran status; and ensure that all employment decisions are based only on valid job requirements. The policy shall state that employees and applicants shall not be subjected to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion or discrimination because they have engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;

(2) Assisting or participating in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the affirmative action provisions of VEVRAA or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans;

(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by VEVRAA or its implementing regulations in this part or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans; or

(4) Exercising any other right protected by VEVRAA or its implementing regulations in this part.

(b)The contractor shall ensure that its personnel processes provide for careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of applicants and employees who are known protected veterans for job vacancies filled either by hiring or promotion, and for all training opportunities offered or available. The contractor shall ensure that when a protected veteran is considered for employment opportunities, the contractor relies only on that portion of the individual's military record, including his or her discharge papers, relevant to the requirements of the opportunity in issue. The contractor shall ensure that its personnel processes do not stereotype protected veterans in a manner which limits their access to all jobs for which they are qualified. The contractor shall periodically review such processes and make any necessary modifications to ensure that these obligations are carried out. A description of the review and any necessary modifications to personnel processes or development of new processes shall be included in any affirmative action programs required under this part. The contractor must design procedures that facilitate a review of the implementation of this requirement by the contractor and the Government (Appendix C of this part is an example of an appropriate set of procedures. The procedures in appendix C are not required and contractors may develop other procedures appropriate to their circumstances.)

(c)(1) The contractor shall provide in its affirmative action program, and shall adhere to, a schedule for the periodic review of all physical and mental job qualification standards to ensure that, to the extent qualification standards tend to screen out qualified disabled veterans, they are job-related for the position in question and are consistent with business necessity.

(2) Whenever the contractor applies physical or mental qualification standards in the selection of applicants or employees for employment or other change in employment status such as promotion, demotion or training, to the extent that qualification standards tend to screen out qualified disabled veterans, the standards shall be related to the specific job or jobs for which the individual is being considered and consistent with business necessity. The contractor has the burden to demonstrate that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2).

(3) The contractor may use as a defense to an allegation of a violation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section that an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. (See § 60&#x2013;300.2(g) defining direct threat.)

(d)As is provided in § 60&#x2013;300.21(f), as a matter of nondiscrimination the contractor must make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled veteran unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business. As a matter of affirmative action, if an employee who is known to be a disabled veteran is having significant difficulty performing his or her job and it is reasonable to conclude that the performance problem may be related to the known disability, the contractor shall confidentially notify the employee of the performance problem and inquire whether the problem is related to the employee's disability; if the employee responds affirmatively, the contractor shall confidentially inquire whether the employee is in need of a reasonable accommodation.

(e)The contractor must develop and implement procedures to ensure that its employees are not harassed because of their status as a protected veteran.

(f)&#x2014;(1)

(i) The contractor shall undertake appropriate outreach and positive recruitment activities such as those listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section that are reasonably designed to effectively recruit protected veterans. It is not contemplated that the contractor will necessarily undertake all the activities listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or that its activities will be limited to those listed. The scope of the contractor's efforts shall depend upon all the circumstances, including the contractor's size and resources and the extent to which existing employment practices are adequate.

(ii) The contractor must send written notification of company policy related to its affirmative action efforts to all subcontractors, including subcontracting vendors and suppliers, requesting appropriate action on their part.

(2). Below are examples of outreach and positive recruitment activities referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. This is an illustrative list, and contractors may choose from these or other activities, as appropriate to their circumstances.

(i) Enlisting the assistance and support of the following persons and organizations in recruiting, and developing on-the-job training opportunities for veterans, in order to fulfill its commitment to provide meaningful employment opportunities for such veterans:

(A) The Local Veterans' Employment Representative in the local employment service office (, the One-Stop) nearest the contractor's establishment;

(B) The Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office nearest the contractor's establishment;

(C) The veterans' counselors and coordinators (“Vet-Reps”) on college campuses;

(D) The service officers of the national veterans' groups active in the area of the contractor's establishment;

(E) Local veterans' groups and veterans' service centers near the contractor's establishment;

(F) The Department of Defense Transition Assistance Program (TAP), or any subsequent program that, in whole or in part, might replace TAP; and

(G) Any organization listed in the Employer Resources section of the National Resource Directory (), or any future service that replaces or complements it.

(ii) The contractor should also consider taking the actions listed below, as appropriate, to fulfill its commitment to provide meaningful employment opportunities to protected veterans:

(A) Formal briefing sessions should be held, preferably on company premises, with representatives from recruiting sources. Contractor facility tours, clear and concise explanations of current and future job openings, position descriptions, worker specifications, explanations of the company's selection process, and recruiting literature should be an integral part of the briefing. At any such briefing sessions, the company official in charge of the contractor's affirmative action program should be in attendance when possible. Formal arrangements should be made for referral of applicants, follow up with sources, and feedback on disposition of applicants.

(B) The contractor's recruitment efforts at all educational institutions should incorporate special efforts to reach students who are protected veterans.

(C) An effort should be made to participate in work-study programs with Department of Veterans Affairs rehabilitation facilities which specialize in training or educating disabled veterans.

(E) The contractor should take any other positive steps it deems necessary to attract qualified protected veterans not currently in the work force who have requisite skills and can be recruited through affirmative action measures. These persons may be located through the local chapters of organizations of and for any of the classifications of protected veterans.

(F) The contractor, in making hiring decisions, should consider applicants who are known protected veterans for all available positions for which they may be qualified when the position(s) applied for is unavailable.

(G) The contractor should consider listing its job openings with the National Resource Directory's Veterans Job Bank, or any future service that replaces or complements it.

(3)The contractor shall, on an annual basis, review the outreach and recruitment efforts it has taken over the previous twelve months to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying and recruiting qualified protected veterans. The contractor shall document each evaluation, including at a minimum the criteria it used to evaluate the effectiveness of each effort and the contractor's conclusion as to whether each effort was effective. Among these criteria shall be the data collected pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section for the current year and the two most recent previous years. The contractor's conclusion as to the effectiveness of its outreach efforts must be reasonable as determined by OFCCP in light of these regulations. If the contractor concludes the totality of its efforts were not effective in identifying and recruiting qualified protected veterans, it shall identify and implement alternative efforts listed in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section in order to fulfill its obligations.

(4)The contractor shall document all activities it undertakes to comply with the obligations of this section, and retain these documents for a period of three (3) years.

(g)(1) A strong outreach program will be ineffective without adequate internal support from supervisory and management personnel and other employees. In order to assure greater employee cooperation and participation in the contractor's efforts, the contractor shall develop the internal procedures listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for communication of its obligation to engage in affirmative action efforts to employ and advance in employment qualified protected veterans. It is not contemplated that the contractor's activities will be limited to those listed. These procedures shall be designed to foster understanding, acceptance and support among the contractor's executive, management, supervisory and other employees and to encourage such persons to take the necessary actions to aid the contractor in meeting this obligation.

(2) The contractor shall implement and disseminate this policy internally as follows:

(i) Include it in the contractor's policy manual or otherwise make the policy available to employees;

(ii) If the contractor is party to a collective bargaining agreement, it shall notify union officials and/or employee representatives to inform them of the contractor's policy, and request their cooperation;

(3) The contractor is encouraged to additionally implement and disseminate this policy internally as follows:

(i) Inform all employees and prospective employees of its commitment to engage in affirmative action to increase employment opportunities for protected veterans;

(ii) Publicize it in the company newspaper, magazine, annual report and other media;

(iii) Conduct special meetings with executive, management, and supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and individual responsibility for effective implementation, making clear the chief executive officer's support for the affirmative action policy;

(iv) Discuss the policy thoroughly in both employee orientation and management training programs;

(v) When employees are featured in employee handbooks or similar publications for employees, include disabled veterans.

(h)(1) The contractor shall design and implement an audit and reporting system that will:

(i) Measure the effectiveness of the contractor's affirmative action program;

(ii) Indicate any need for remedial action;

(iii) Determine the degree to which the contractor's objectives have been attained;

(iv) Determine whether known protected veterans have had the opportunity to participate in all company sponsored educational, training, recreational and social activities;

(v) Measure the contractor's compliance with the affirmative action program's specific obligations; and

(vi) Document the actions taken to comply with the obligations of paragraphs (i) through (v) above, and retain these documents as employment records subject to the recordkeeping requirements of § 60&#x2013;300.80.

(2) Where the affirmative action program is found to be deficient, the contractor shall undertake necessary action to bring the program into compliance.

(i)An official of the contractor shall be assigned responsibility for implementation of the contractor's affirmative action activities under this part. His or her identity should appear on all internal and external communications regarding the company's affirmative action program. This official shall be given necessary senior management support and staff to manage the implementation of this program.

(j)All personnel involved in the recruitment, screening, selection, promotion, disciplinary, and related processes shall be trained to ensure that the commitments in the contractor's affirmative action program are implemented.

(k)The contractor shall document the following computations or comparisons pertaining to applicants and hires on an annual basis and maintain them for a period of three (3) years:

(1) The number of applicants who self-identified as protected veterans pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.42(a), or who are otherwise known as protected veterans;

(2) The total number of job openings and total number of jobs filled;

(3) The total number of applicants for all jobs;

(4) The number of protected veteran applicants hired; and

(5) The total number of applicants hired.

###### § 60-300.45 Benchmarks for hiring.

The benchmark is not a rigid and inflexible quota which must be met, nor is it to be considered either a ceiling or a floor for the employment of particular groups. Quotas are expressly forbidden.

(a)The purpose of establishing benchmarks is to create a quantifiable method by which the contractor can measure its progress toward achieving equal employment opportunity for protected veterans.

(b) Hiring benchmarks shall be set by the contractor on an annual basis. Benchmarks shall be set using one of the two mechanisms described below:

(1) Establish a benchmark equaling the national percentage of veterans in the civilian labor force, which will be published and updated annually on the OFCCP Web site; or

(2) Establish a benchmark by taking into account:

(i) The average percentage of veterans in the civilian labor force in the State(s) where the contractor is located over the preceding three years, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and published on the OFCCP Web site;

(ii) The number of veterans, over the previous four quarters, who were participants in the employment service delivery system in the State where the contractor is located, as tabulated by the Veterans' Employment and Training Service and published on the OFCCP Web site;

(iii) The applicant ratio and hiring ratio for the previous year, based on the data collected pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.44(k);

(iv) The contractor's recent assessments of the effectiveness of its external outreach and recruitment efforts, as set forth in § 60&#x2013;300.44(f)(3); and

(v) Any other factors, including but not limited to the nature of the contractor's job openings and/or its location, which would tend to affect the availability of qualified protected veterans.

(c) The contractor shall document the hiring benchmark it has established each year. If the contractor sets its benchmark using the procedure in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it shall document each of the factors that it considered in establishing the hiring benchmark and the relative significance of each of these factors. The contractor shall retain these records for a period of three (3) years.

##### Subpart D - General Enforcement and Complaint Procedures

###### § 60-300.60 Compliance evaluations.

(a) OFCCP may conduct compliance evaluations to determine if the contractor is taking affirmative action to employ, advance in employment and otherwise treat qualified individuals without discrimination based on their status as a protected veteran in all employment practices. A compliance evaluation may consist of any one or any combination of the following investigative procedures:

(1)A comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the hiring and employment practices of the contractor, the written affirmative action program, and the results of the affirmative action efforts undertaken by the contractor. A compliance review may proceed in three stages:

(i) A desk audit of the written affirmative action program and supporting documentation to determine whether all elements required by the regulations in this part are included, whether the affirmative action program meets agency standards of reasonableness, and whether the affirmative action program and supporting documentation satisfy agency standards of acceptability. OFCCP may extend the temporal scope of the desk audit beyond that set forth in the scheduling letter if OFCCP deems it necessary to carry out its investigation of potential violations of this part. The desk audit is conducted at OFCCP offices;

(ii) An on-site review, conducted at the contractor's establishment to investigate unresolved problem areas identified in the affirmative action program and supporting documentation during the desk audit, to verify that the contractor has implemented the affirmative action program and has complied with those regulatory obligations not required to be included in the affirmative action program, and to examine potential instances or issues of discrimination. An on-site review normally will involve an examination of the contractor's personnel and employment policies, inspection and copying of documents related to employment actions, and interviews with employees, supervisors, managers, hiring officials; and

(iii) Where necessary, an off-site analysis of information supplied by the contractor or otherwise gathered during or pursuant to the on-site review;

(2)An analysis and evaluation of the affirmative action program (or any part thereof) and supporting documentation, and other documents related to the contractor's personnel policies and employment actions that may be relevant to a determination of whether the contractor has complied with the requirements of VEVRAA and its regulations;

(3)A determination of whether the contractor has maintained records consistent with § 60&#x2013;300.80; OFCCP may request the documents be provided either on-site or off-site; or

(4)A review restricted to one or more components of the contractor's organization or one or more aspects of the contractor's employment practices.

(b) Where deficiencies are found to exist, reasonable efforts shall be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.62.

(c)During a compliance evaluation, OFCCP may verify whether the contractor has complied with applicable reporting requirements required under regulations promulgated by the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). If the contractor has not complied with any such reporting requirement, OFCCP will notify VETS.

(d)Each agency will include in the invitation for bids for each formally advertised nonconstruction contract or state at the outset of negotiations for each negotiated contract, that if the award, when let, should total $10 million or more, the prospective contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with subcontracts of $10 million or more will be subject to a compliance evaluation before the award of the contract unless OFCCP has conducted an evaluation and found them to be in compliance with VEVRAA within the preceding 24 months. The awarding agency will notify OFCCP and request appropriate action and findings in accordance with this subsection. Within 15 days of the notice OFCCP will inform the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation. If OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation, OFCCP will be allowed an additional 20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its conclusions within that period, clearance will be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.

###### § 60-300.61 Complaint procedures.

(a)Any applicant for employment with a contractor or any employee of a contractor may, personally, or by an authorized representative, file a written complaint alleging a violation of the Act or the regulations in this part. The complaint may allege individual or class-wide violation(s). Such complaint must be filed within 300 days of the date of the alleged violation, unless the time for filing is extended by OFCCP for good cause shown. Complaints may be submitted to OFCCP, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210, or to any OFCCP regional, district, or area office. Complaints may also be submitted to the Veterans' Employment and Training Service of the Department of Labor directly, or through the Local Veterans' Employment Representative (LVER) at the local employment service office. Such parties will assist veterans in preparing complaints, promptly refer such complaints to OFCCP, and maintain a record of all complaints which they receive and forward. OFCCP shall inform the party forwarding the complaint of the progress and results of its complaint investigation. The state employment service delivery system shall cooperate with the Director in the investigation of any complaint.

(b)&#x2014;(1)A complaint must be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following information:

(i) Name and address (including telephone number) of the complainant;

(ii) Name and address of the contractor who committed the alleged violation;

(iii) Documentation showing that the individual is a protected veteran or pre-JVA veteran. Such documentation must include a copy of the veteran's form DD&#x2013;214, and, where applicable, a copy of the veteran's Benefits Award Letter, or similar Department of Veterans Affairs certification, updated within one year prior to the date the complaint is filed;

(iv) A description of the act or acts considered to be a violation, including the pertinent dates (in the case of an alleged continuing violation, the earliest and most recent date that the alleged violation occurred should be stated); and

(v) Other pertinent information available which will assist in the investigation and resolution of the complaint, including the name of any known Federal agency with which the employer has contracted.

(2)A complaint filed by an authorized representative need not identify by name the person on whose behalf it is filed. The person filing the complaint, however, shall provide OFCCP with the name, address and telephone number of the person on whose behalf it is made, and the other information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. OFCCP shall verify the authorization of such a complaint by the person on whose behalf the complaint is made. Any such person may request that OFCCP keep his or her identity confidential, and OFCCP will protect the individual's confidentiality wherever that is possible given the facts and circumstances in the complaint.

(c)Where a complaint contains incomplete information, OFCCP shall seek the needed information from the complainant. If the information is not furnished to OFCCP within 60 days of the date of such request, the case may be closed.

(d)The Department of Labor shall institute a prompt investigation of each complaint.

(e)(1) If the complaint investigation finds no violation of the Act or this part, or if the Director decides not to refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor for enforcement proceedings against the contractor pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.65(a)(1), the complainant and contractor shall be so notified. The Director, on his or her own initiative, may reconsider his or her determination or the determination of any of his or her designated officers who have authority to issue Notifications of Results of Investigation.

(2) The Director will review all determinations of no violation that involve complaints that are not also cognizable under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(3) In cases where the Director decides to reconsider the determination of a Notification of Results of Investigation, the Director shall provide prompt notification of his or her intent to reconsider, which is effective upon issuance, and his or her final determination after reconsideration, to the person claiming to be aggrieved, the person making the complaint on behalf of such person, if any, and the contractor.

(4) If the investigation finds a violation of the Act or this part, OFCCP shall invite the contractor to participate in conciliation discussions pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.62.

###### § 60-300.62 Resolution procedures.

(a)If a compliance review or other review by OFCCP indicates evidence sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice, subject to the following parameters and the approval of the Director or acting agency head:

(1) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate treatment theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate that the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Provide qualitative evidence as defined in this part that, in combination with other evidence, supports both a finding of discriminatory intent by the contractor and a finding that the contractor's discriminatory intent caused the disparate treatment.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice under a disparate treatment theory of liability without satisfying all three components listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if:

(i) The qualitative evidence by itself is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment;

(ii) The evidence of disparity between a favored and disfavored group is so extraordinarily compelling that by itself it is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment; or

(iii) Paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and the contractor denied OFCCP access to sources of evidence that may be relevant to a preliminary finding of discriminatory intent. This may include denying access to its employees during a compliance evaluation or destroying or failing to produce records the contractor is legally required to create and maintain.

(3) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate impact theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Identify the specific policy or practice of the contractor causing the adverse impact, unless OFCCP can demonstrate that the elements of the contractor's selection procedures are incapable of separation for analysis.

(4) The Predetermination Notice must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Predetermination Notice; however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Predetermination Notice based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation for why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(5) Any response to a Predetermination Notice must be submitted by the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Notice, which deadline OFCCP may extend for good cause.

(b)(1) If, following OFCCP's review of any response by the contractor pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the agency has evidence sufficient to support a finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, as established in the parameters and exceptions in paragraph (a) of this section, or that the contractor has committed other material violations of the equal opportunity clause (with the exception of violations for denying access or failing to submit records in response to OFCCP's Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-approved Scheduling Letters, for which OFCCP may proceed directly to issuing a Show Cause Notice), OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation to the contractor requiring corrective action and inviting conciliation through a written agreement, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation alleging a finding of discrimination following issuance of a Predetermination Notice if the contractor does not respond or provide a sufficient response within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Predetermination Notice, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head, unless OFCCP has extended the Predetermination Notice response time for good cause shown.

(3) The Notice of Violation must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Notice of Violation, however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Notice of Violation based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(4) The Notice of Violation must address all relevant concerns and defenses raised by the contractor in response to the Predetermination Notice.

(c)If a compliance review, complaint investigation, or other review by OFCCP or its representative indicates a material violation of the equal opportunity clause, and:

(1) If the contractor, subcontractor or bidder is willing to correct the violations and/or deficiencies; and

(2) If OFCCP or its representative determines that settlement (rather than referral for consideration of formal enforcement) is appropriate, a written agreement shall be required. The agreement shall provide for such remedial action as may be necessary to correct the violations and/or deficiencies noted, including, where appropriate (but not necessarily limited to), remedies such as back pay and retroactive seniority.

(d)A contractor may voluntarily waive the procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section to enter directly into a conciliation agreement. OFCCP may inform the contractor of this expedited conciliation option, but may not require or insist that the contractor avail itself of the expedited conciliation option.

(e)Should a court of competent jurisdiction hold any provision(s) of this section to be invalid, such action will not affect any other provision of this section.

###### § 60-300.63 Violation of conciliation agreements.

(a) When OFCCP believes that a conciliation agreement has been violated, the following procedures are applicable:

(1) A written notice shall be sent to the contractor setting forth the violation alleged and summarizing the supporting evidence. The contractor shall have 15 days from receipt of the notice to respond, except in those cases in which OFCCP asserts that such a delay would result in irreparable injury to the employment rights of affected employees or applicants.

(2) During the 15-day period the contractor may demonstrate in writing that it has not violated its commitments.

(b) In those cases in which OFCCP asserts that a delay would result in irreparable injury to the employment rights of affected employees or applicants, enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately without proceeding through any other requirement contained in this chapter.

(c) In any proceedings involving an alleged violation of a conciliation agreement OFCCP may seek enforcement of the agreement itself and shall not be required to present proof of the underlying violations resolved by the agreement.

###### § 60-300.64 Show cause notices.

When the Director has reasonable cause to believe that the contractor has violated the Act or this part, he or she may issue a notice requiring the contractor to show cause, within 30 days, why monitoring, enforcement proceedings or other appropriate action to ensure compliance should not be instituted. The issuance of such a notice is not a prerequisite to instituting enforcement proceedings (see § 60&#x2013;300.65).

###### § 60-300.65 Enforcement proceedings.

(a)(1) If a compliance evaluation, complaint investigation or other review by OFCCP finds a violation of the Act or this part, and the violation has not been corrected in accordance with the conciliation procedures in this part, or OFCCP determines that referral for consideration of formal enforcement (rather than settlement) is appropriate, OFCCP may refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor with a recommendation for the institution of enforcement proceedings to enjoin the violations, to seek appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions, or any of the above in this sentence. OFCCP may seek back pay and other make whole relief for aggrieved individuals identified during a complaint investigation or compliance evaluation. Such individuals need not have filed a complaint as a prerequisite to OFCCP seeking such relief on their behalf. Interest on back pay shall be calculated from the date of the loss and compounded quarterly at the percentage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service for the underpayment of taxes.

(2) In addition to the administrative proceedings set forth in this section, the Director may, within the limitations of applicable law, seek appropriate judicial action to enforce the contractual provisions set forth in § 60&#x2013;300.5, including appropriate injunctive relief.

(b)(1) In administrative enforcement proceedings the contractor shall be provided an opportunity for a formal hearing. All hearings conducted under the Act and this part shall be governed by the Rules of Practice for Administrative Proceedings to Enforce Equal Opportunity Under Executive Order 11246 contained in 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;30 and the Rules of Evidence set out in the Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges contained in 29 CFR part 18, subpart B:That a final administrative order shall be issued within one year from the date of the issuance of the recommended findings, conclusions and decision of the Administrative Law Judge, or the submission of exceptions and responses to exceptions to such decision (if any), whichever is later.

(2) Complaints may be filed by the Solicitor, the Associate Solicitor for Civil Rights and Labor-Management, Regional Solicitors, and Associate Regional Solicitors.

(3) For the purposes of hearings pursuant to this part, references in 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;30 to “Executive Order 11246” shall mean the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended; references to “equal opportunity clause” shall mean the equal opportunity clause published at § 60&#x2013;300.5; and references to “regulations” shall mean the regulations contained in this part.

###### § 60-300.66 Sanctions and penalties.

(a)With the prior approval of the Director, so much of the accrued payment due on the contract or any other contract between the Government contractor and the Federal Government may be withheld as necessary to correct any violations of the provisions of the Act or this part.

(b)A contract may be canceled or terminated, in whole or in part, for failure to comply with the provisions of the Act or this part.

(c)A contractor may be debarred from receiving future contracts for failure to comply with the provisions of the Act or this part subject to reinstatement pursuant to § 60&#x2013;300.68. Debarment may be imposed for an indefinite period, or may be imposed for a fixed period of not less than six months but no more than three years.

(d)An opportunity for a formal hearing shall be afforded to a contractor before the imposition of any sanction or penalty.

###### § 60-300.67 Notification of agencies.

The Director shall ensure that the heads of all agencies are notified of any debarments taken against any contractor.

###### § 60-300.68 Reinstatement of ineligible contractors.

(a)A contractor debarred from further contracts for an indefinite period under the Act may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director at any time after the effective date of the debarment; a contractor debarred for a fixed period may make such a request following the expiration of six months from the effective date of the debarment. In connection with the reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors shall be required to show that they have established and will carry out employment policies and practices in compliance with the Act and this part. Additionally, in determining whether reinstatement is appropriate for a contractor debarred for a fixed period, the Director also shall consider, among other factors, the severity of the violation which resulted in the debarment, the contractor's attitude towards compliance, the contractor's past compliance history, and whether the contractor's reinstatement would impede the effective enforcement of the Act or this part. Before reaching a decision, the Director may conduct a compliance evaluation of the contractor and may require the contractor to supply additional information regarding the request for reinstatement. The Director shall issue a written decision on the request.

(b)Within 30 days of its receipt of a decision denying a request for reinstatement, the contractor may file a petition for review of the decision with the Secretary. The petition shall set forth the grounds for the contractor's objections to the Director's decision. The petition shall be served on the Director and the Associate Solicitor for Civil Rights and Labor-Management and shall include the decision as an appendix. The Director may file a response within 14 days to the petition. The Secretary shall issue the final agency decision denying or granting the request for reinstatement. Before reaching a final decision, the Secretary may issue such additional orders respecting procedure as he or she finds appropriate in the circumstances, including an order referring the matter to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for an evidentiary hearing where there is a material factual dispute that cannot be resolved on the record before the Secretary.

###### § 60-300.69 Intimidation and interference.

(a) The contractor shall not harass, intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual because the individual has engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;

(2) Assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the Act or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans;

(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by the Act or this part or any other Federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity for protected veterans, or

(4) Exercising any other right protected by the Act or this part.

(b) The contractor shall ensure that all persons under its control do not engage in such harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion or discrimination. The sanctions and penalties contained in this part may be exercised by the Director against any contractor who violates this obligation.

###### § 60-300.70 Disputed matters related to compliance with the Act.

The procedures set forth in the regulations in this part govern all disputes relative to the contractor's compliance with the Act and this part. Any disputes relating to issues other than compliance, including contract costs arising out of the contractor's efforts to comply, shall be determined by the disputes clause of the contract.

##### Subpart E - Ancillary Matters

###### § 60-300.80 Recordkeeping.

(a)Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, any personnel or employment record made or kept by the contractor shall be preserved by the contractor for a period of two years from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. However, if the contractor has fewer than 150 employees or does not have a Government contract of at least $150,000, the minimum record retention period will be one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later, except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Such records include, but are not necessarily limited to, records relating to requests for reasonable accommodation; the results of any physical examination; job advertisements and postings; applications and resumes; tests and test results; interview notes; and other records having to do with hiring, assignment, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination, rates of pay or other terms of compensation, and selection for training or apprenticeship. In the case of involuntary termination of an employee, the personnel records of the individual terminated shall be kept for a period of two years from the date of the termination, except that contractors that have fewer than 150 employees or that do not have a Government contract of at least $150,000 shall keep such records for a period of one year from the date of the termination. Where the contractor has received notice that a complaint of discrimination has been filed, that a compliance evaluation has been initiated, or that an enforcement action has been commenced, the contractor shall preserve all personnel records relevant to the complaint, compliance evaluation or action until final disposition of the complaint, compliance evaluation or action. The termwould include, for example, personnel or employment records relating to the aggrieved person and to all other employees holding positions similar to that held or sought by the aggrieved person, and application forms or test papers completed by an unsuccessful applicant and by all other candidates for the same position as that for which the aggrieved person applied and was rejected.

(b)Records required by §§ 60&#x2013;300.44(f)(4), 60&#x2013;300.44(k), and 60&#x2013;300.45(c) shall be maintained by all contractors for a period of three years from the date of the making of the record.

(c)Failure to preserve complete and accurate records as required by this part constitutes noncompliance with the contractor's obligations under the Act and this part. Where the contractor has destroyed or failed to preserve records as required by this section, there may be a presumption that the information destroyed or not preserved would have been unfavorable to the contractor:That this presumption shall not apply where the contractor shows that the destruction or failure to preserve records results from circumstances that are outside of the contractor's control.

(d) The requirements of this section shall apply only to records made or kept on or after the date that the Office of Management and Budget has cleared the requirements.

###### § 60-300.81 Access to records.

Each contractor shall permit access during normal business hours to its places of business for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance evaluations and complaint investigations and inspecting and copying such books, accounts, and records, including electronic records, and any other material OFCCP deems relevant to the matter under investigation and pertinent to compliance with the Act or this part. Contractors must also provide OFCCP access to these materials, including electronic records, off-site for purposes of conducting compliance evaluations and complaint investigations. Upon request, the contractor must provide OFCCP information about all format(s), including specific electronic formats, in which the contractor maintains its records and other information. The contractor must provide records and other information in any of the formats in which they are maintained, as selected by OFCCP. Information obtained in this manner shall be used only in connection with the administration of the Act and in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. OFCCP will treat records provided by the contractor to OFCCP under this section as confidential to the maximum extent the information is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

###### § 60-300.82 Labor organizations and recruiting and training agencies.

(a) Whenever performance in accordance with the equal opportunity clause or any matter contained in the regulations in this part may necessitate a revision of a collective bargaining agreement, the labor organizations which are parties to such agreement shall be given an adequate opportunity to present their views to OFCCP.

(b) OFCCP shall use its best efforts, directly or through contractors, subcontractors, local officials, the Department of Veterans Affairs, vocational rehabilitation facilities, and all other available instrumentalities, to cause any labor organization, recruiting and training agency or other representative of workers who are employed by a contractor to cooperate with, and to assist in, the implementation of the purposes of the Act.

###### § 60-300.83 Rulings and interpretations.

Rulings under or interpretations of the Act and this part shall be made by the Director.

###### § 60-300.84 Responsibilities of appropriate employment service delivery system.

By statute, appropriate employment service delivery systems are required to refer qualified protected veterans to fill employment openings listed by contractors with such appropriate employment delivery systems pursuant to the mandatory job listing requirements of the equal opportunity clause and are required to give priority to protected veterans in making such referrals. The employment service delivery systems shall provide OFCCP, upon request, information pertinent to whether the contractor is in compliance with the mandatory job listing requirements of the equal opportunity clause.

#### PART 60-741 - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND NONDISCRIMINATION OBLIGATIONS OF FEDERAL CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS REGARDING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES

##### Subpart A - Preliminary Matters, Equal Opportunity Clause

###### § 60-741.1 Purpose, applicability, and construction.

(a)The purpose of this part is to set forth the standards for compliance with section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 793), which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires Government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities.

(b)This part applies to all Government contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000 for the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services (including construction):That subpart C of this part applies only as described in § 60&#x2013;741.40(a). Compliance by the contractor with the provisions of this part will not necessarily determine its compliance with other statutes, and compliance with other statutes will not necessarily determine its compliance with this part:That compliance shall also satisfy the employment provisions of the Department of Labor's regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (see 29 CFR 32.2(b)) when the contractor is also subject to those requirements.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Except as otherwise provided in this part, this part does not apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 12101) or the regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission pursuant to that title (29 CFR part 1630). The Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act set out as an appendix to 29 CFR part 1630 issued pursuant to that title may be relied upon for guidance in interpreting the parallel non-discrimination provisions of this part.

(2)Nothing in this part alters the standards for determining eligibility for benefits under State worker's compensation laws or under State and Federal disability benefit programs.

(3)This part does not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures under any Federal law or the law of any State or political subdivision that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities as compared to the protection afforded by this part. It may be a defense to a charge of violation of this part that a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation, or that another Federal law or regulation prohibits an action (including the provision of a particular reasonable accommodation) that would otherwise be required by this part.

###### § 60-741.2 Definitions.

For the purpose of this part:

(a)means the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 706 and 793.

(b)means any one or combination of actions OFCCP may take to examine a Federal contractor's or subcontractor's compliance with one or more of the requirements of section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

(c)means any Government contract or subcontract.

(d)means, unless otherwise indicated, a prime contractor or subcontractor holding a contract in excess of $10,000.

(e)means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. The determination that an individual with a disability poses a direct threat shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to perform safely the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:

(1) The duration of the risk;

(2) The nature and severity of the potential harm;

(3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and

(ii) A record of such an impairment; or

(iii) Being regarded as having such an impairment (as defined in paragraph (v) of this section).

(2) As used in this part, the definition of “disability” must be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The question of whether an individual meets the definition under this part should not demand extensive analysis.

(3) An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities in order to be considered a disability.

(4) An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.

(5) See paragraphs (m), (o), (t), (v), and (z) of this section, respectively, for definitions of “major life activities,” “physical or mental impairment,” “record of such an impairment,” “regarded as having such an impairment,” and “substantially limits.”

(iii) The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.

(3) Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to:

(i) The contractor's judgment as to which functions are essential;

(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;

(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;

The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.

(3) In determining other examples of major life activities, the term “major” shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability. Whether an activity is a “major life activity” is not determined by reference to whether it is of “central importance to daily life.”

Qualitative evidence may not be based solely on subjective inferences or the mere fact of supervisory discretion in employment decisions. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) may also consider qualitative evidence in the form of a contractor's efforts to advance equal employment opportunity beyond mere compliance with legal obligations in determining whether intentional discrimination has occurred.

(t)includes hypothesis testing, controlling for the major, measurable parameters, and variables used by the contractor (including, as appropriate, preferred qualifications, other demographic variables, test scores, geographic variables, performance evaluations, years of experience, quality of experience, years of service, quality and reputation of previous employers, years of education, years of training, quality and reputation of credentialing institutions,), related to the probability of outcomes occurring by chance and/or analyses reflecting statements concluding that a disparity in employment selection rates or rates of compensation is statistically significant by reference to any one of these statements:

(1) The disparity is two or more times larger than its standard error (a standard deviation of two or more);

(2) The Z statistic has a value greater than two; or

(3) The probability value is less than 0.05. It also includes numerical analysis of similarly situated individuals, small groups, or other characteristics, demographics or outcomes where hypothesis-testing techniques are not used.

(i) To a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such applicant desires;or

(ii) To the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position; or

(3) To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the contractor to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. (Appendix A of this part provides guidance on a contractor's duty to provide reasonable accommodation.)

(4) Individuals who meet the definition of “disability” solely under the “regarded as” prong of the definition of “disability” as defined in paragraph (v)(1) of this section are not entitled to receive reasonable accommodation.

(v)means has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. An individual shall be considered to have a record of a disability if the individual has a history of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities when compared to most people in the general population, or was misclassified as having had such an impairment.

(w)means any person who refers workers to any contractor, or who provides or supervises apprenticeship or training for employment by any contractor.

(x)&#x2014;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (v)(4) of this section, an individual is regarded as having such an impairment if the individual is subjected to an action prohibited under subpart B (Discrimination Prohibited) of these regulations because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not the impairment substantially limits or is perceived to substantially limit a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (v)(4) of this section, an individual is regarded as having such an impairment any time a contractor takes a prohibited action against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the contractor asserts, or may or does ultimately establish a defense to such action.

(3) Establishing that an individual is regarded as having such an impairment does not, by itself, establish liability for unlawful discrimination in violation of this part. Such liability is established only when an individual proves that a contractor discriminated on the basis of disability as prohibited by this part.

(4)Paragraph (v)(1) of this section shall not apply to an impairment that is shown by the contractor to be transitory and minor. The contractor must demonstrate that the impairment is“transitory”“minor.” Whether the impairment at issue is or would be “transitory and “minor” is to be determined objectively. The fact that a contractor subjectively believed the impairment was transitory and minor is not sufficient to defeat an individual's coverage under paragraph (v)(1) of this section.

(i) An impairment is transitory if it has an actual or expected duration of six months or less.

(ii) [Reserved]

(y)means the Secretary of Labor, United States Department of Labor, or his or her designee.

(z)(1) Subcontract means any agreement or arrangement between a contractor and any person (in which the parties do not stand in the relationship of an employer and an employee):

(i) For the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services which, in whole or in part, is necessary to the performance of any one or more contracts; or

(ii) Under which any portion of the contractor's obligation under any one or more contracts is performed, undertaken, or assumed; and

(2) Does not include an agreement between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(i) An agreement means a relationship between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(ii) A health care provider is a physician, hospital, or other individual or entity that furnishes health care services or supplies.

(iii) A health organization is a voluntary association, corporation, partnership, managed care support contractor, or other nongovernmental organization that is lawfully engaged in providing, paying for, insuring, or reimbursing the cost of health care services or supplies under group insurance policies or contracts, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, network agreements, health benefits plans duly sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization or association of organizations and health maintenance organizations, or other similar arrangements, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges or payments payable to the health organization.

(aa)means any person holding a subcontract in excess of $10,000 and, for the purposes of subpart D of this part, “General Enforcement and Complaint Procedures,” any person who has held a subcontract subject to the act.

(bb)&#x2014;(1)The term “substantially limits” shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by law.is not meant to be a demanding standard and should not demand extensive analysis.

(i) An impairment is substantially limiting within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered “substantially limiting.” Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.

(ii) The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis. However, nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the presentation of scientific, medical, or statistical evidence to make such a comparison where appropriate.

(iii) In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it may be useful in appropriate cases to consider, as compared to most people in the general population, the condition under which the individual performs the major life activity; the manner in which the individual performs the major life activity; and/or the duration of time it takes the individual to perform the major life activity, or for which the individual can perform the major life activity. This may include consideration of facts such as the difficulty, effort, or time required to perform a major life activity; pain experienced when performing a major life activity; the length of time a major life activity can be performed; and/or the way an impairment affects the operation of a major bodily function.

(2)Whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity is not relevant to a determination of whether the individual is regarded as having a disability within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.

(3)Except as provided in paragraph (z)(3)(i) of this section, the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures as defined in paragraph (n) of this section.

(i) The ameliorative effects of the mitigating measures of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. See paragraph (n)(2) of this section for a definition of “ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.”

(ii)The non-ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, such as negative side effects of medication or burdens associated with following a particular treatment regimen, may be considered when determining whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity.

(4) In determining whether an individual is substantially limited the focus is on how a major life activity is substantially limited, and not on the outcomes an individual can achieve. For example, someone with a learning disability may achieve a high level of academic success, but may nevertheless be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning because of the additional time or effort he or she must spend to read, write, or learn compared to most people in the general population.

(5)The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment. However, the principles set forth in this section are intended to provide for generous coverage through a framework that is predictable, consistent, and workable for all individuals and contractors with rights and responsibilities under this part. Therefore, the individualized assessment of some types of impairments will, in virtually all cases, result in a determination of coverage under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. Given their inherent nature, these types of impairments will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity. With respect to these types of impairments, the necessary individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.

(i)Applying the principles set forth in this section it should easily be concluded that the following types of impairments will, at a minimum, substantially limit the major life activities indicated: deafness substantially limits hearing; blindness substantially limits seeing; an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation) substantially limits brain function; partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair substantially limit musculoskeletal function; autism substantially limits brain function; cancer substantially limits normal cell growth; cerebral palsy substantially limits brain function; diabetes substantially limits endocrine function; epilepsy substantially limits neurological function; Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection substantially limits immune function; multiple sclerosis (MS) substantially limits neurological function; muscular dystrophy substantially limits neurological function; and major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia substantially limit brain function. The types of impairments described in this section may also substantially limit additional major life activities not explicitly listed above.

(ii) [Reserved]

(cc)&#x2014;(1)means, with respect to the provision of an accommodation, significant difficulty or expense incurred by the contractor, when considered in light of the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(2) of this section.

(2)In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the contractor, factors to be considered include:

(i) The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits and deductions, and/or outside funding;

(ii) The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources;

(iii) The overall financial resources of the contractor, the overall size of the business of the contractor with respect to the number of its employees, and the number, type and location of its facilities;

(iv) The type of operation or operations of the contractor, including the composition, structure and functions of the work force of such contractor, and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the contractor; and

(v) The impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility, including the impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business.

(dd)as used herein, shall include the several States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island.

###### § 60-741.3 Exceptions to the definitions of “disability” and “qualified individual.”

(a)&#x2014;(1)The terms “disability” and “qualified individual” do not include individuals currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the contractor acts on the basis of such use.

(2)The termmeans a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).

(3)The termmeans the use of drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, as updated pursuant to that act. Such term does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of Federal law.

(See § 60&#x2013;741.24(b)(1).)

(b)&#x2014;(1)The termsanddo not include an individual who is an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol prevents such individual from performing the essential functions of the employment position such individual holds or desires or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or to the health or safety of the individual or others.

(2)Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall relieve the contractor of its obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation for an individual described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when such an accommodation will enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the employment position such individual holds or desires, or when the accommodation will eliminate or reduce the direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others posed by such individual, provided that such individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of such position.

(c)&#x2014;(1)The termsanddo not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unable to perform the essential functions of the employment position such individual holds or desires.

(2)Nothing in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall relieve the contractor of its obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation for an individual described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when such an accommodation will enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the employment position such individual holds or desires, or when the accommodation will eliminate or reduce the direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others posed by such individual, provided that such individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of such position.

(d)Homosexuality and bisexuality are not impairments and so are not disabilities as defined in this part.

###### § 60-741.4 Coverage and waivers.

(a)&#x2014;(1)Contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000 are covered by this part. No contracting agency or contractor shall procure supplies or services in less than usual quantities to avoid the applicability of the equal opportunity clause.

(2)With respect to indefinite delivery-type contracts and subcontracts (including, but not limited to, open end contracts, requirement-type contracts, Federal Supply Schedule contracts, “call-type” contracts, and purchase notice agreements), the equal opportunity clause shall be included unless the contracting agency has reason to believe that the amount to be ordered in any year under such contract will not be in excess of $10,000. The applicability of the equal opportunity clause shall be determined at the time of award for the first year and annually thereafter for succeeding years, if any. Notwithstanding the above, the equal opportunity clause shall be applied to such contract whenever the amount of a single order exceeds $10,000. Once the equal opportunity clause is determined to be applicable, the contract shall continue to be subject to such clause for its duration, regardless of the amounts ordered, or reasonably expected to be ordered in any year.

(3)This part applies only to employment activities within the United States and not to employment activities abroad. The termincludes actual employment within the United States, and decisions of the contractor made within the United States, pertaining to the contractor's applicants and employees who are within the United States, regarding employment opportunities abroad (such as recruiting and hiring within the United States for employment abroad, or transfer of persons employed in the United States to contractor establishments abroad).

(4)The requirements of the equal opportunity clause in any contract or subcontract with a State or local government (or any agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof) shall not be applicable to any agency, instrumentality or subdivision of such government which does not participate in work on or under the contract or subcontract.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The Director may waive the application to any contract of the equal opportunity clause in whole or part when he or she deems that special circumstances in the national interest so require. The Director may also grant such waivers to groups or categories of contracts: where it is in the national interest; where it is found impracticable to act upon each request individually; and where such waiver will substantially contribute to convenience in administration of the act. When a waiver has been granted for any class of contracts, the Director may withdraw the waiver for a specific contract or group of contracts to be awarded, when in his or her judgment such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the act. The withdrawal shall not apply to contracts awarded prior to the withdrawal, except that in procurements entered into by formal advertising, or the various forms of restricted formal advertising, such withdrawal shall not apply unless the withdrawal is made more than 10 calendar days before the date set for the opening of the bids.

(2)Any requirement set forth in the regulations of this part shall not apply to any contract whenever the head of the contracting agency determines that such contract is essential to the national security and that its award without complying with such requirements is necessary to the national security. Upon making such a determination, the head of the contracting agency will notify the Director in writing within 30 days.

(3)(i) Upon the written request of the contractor, the Director may waive the requirements of the equal opportunity clause with respect to any of a contractor's facilities if the Director finds that the contractor has demonstrated that:

(A) The facility is in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the contractor related to the performance of a contract; and

(B) Such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the act.

(ii) The Director's findings as to whether the facility is separate and distinct in all respects from activities of the contractor related to the performance of a contract shall include consideration of the following factors:

(A) Whether any work at the facility directly or indirectly supports or contributes to the satisfaction of the work performed on a Government contract;

(B) The extent to which the facility benefits, directly or indirectly, from a Government contract;

(C) Whether any costs associated with operating the facility are charged to a Government contract;

(D) Whether working at the facility is a prerequisite for advancement in job responsibility or pay, and the extent to which employees at facilities connected to a Government contract are recruited for positions at the facility;

(E) Whether employees or applicants for employment at the facility may perform work related to a Government contract at another facility, and the extent to which employees at the facility are interchangeable with employees at facilities connected to a Government contract; and

(F) Such other factors that the Director deems are necessary or appropriate for considering whether the facility is in all respects separate and distinct from the activities of the contractor related to the performance of a contract.

(iii) The Director's findings as to whether granting a waiver will interfere with or impede the effectuation of the act shall include consideration of the following factors:

(A) Whether the waiver will be used as a subterfuge to circumvent the contractor's obligations under the act;

(B) The contractor's compliance with the act or any other Federal, State or local law requiring equal opportunity for disabled persons;

(C) The impact of granting the waiver on OFCCP enforcement efforts; and

(D) Such other factors that the Director deems are necessary or appropriate for considering whether the granting of the waiver would interfere with or impede the effectuation of the act.

(iv) A contractor granted a waiver under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall:

(A) Promptly inform the Director of any changed circumstances not reflected in the contractor's waiver request; and

(B) Permit the Director access during normal business hours to the contractor's places of business for the purpose of investigating whether the facility granted a waiver meets the standards and requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and for inspecting and copying such books and accounts and records, including computerized records, and other material as may be relevant to the matter under investigation.

(v)(A) A waiver granted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall terminate on one of the following dates, whichever is earliest:

() Two years after the date the waiver was granted.

() When the facility performs any work that directly supports or contributes to the satisfaction of the work performed on a Government contract.

() When the Director determines, based on information provided by the contractor under this section or upon any other relevant information, that the facility does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(B) When a waiver terminates in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(v)(A) of this section the contractor shall ensure that the facility complies with this part on the date of termination, except that compliance with §§ 60&#x2013;741.40 through 60&#x2013;741.44, if applicable, must be attained within 120 days of such termination.

(vi) False or fraudulent statements or representations made by a contractor under paragraph (b)(3) of this section are prohibited and may subject the contractor to sanctions and penalties under this part and criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

This regulation prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of disability, and requires affirmative action by covered prime contractors and subcontractors to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities.”

(e)By operation of the act, the equal opportunity clause shall be considered to be a part of every contract and subcontract required by the act and the regulations in this part to include such a clause, whether or not it is physically incorporated in such contract and whether or not there is a written contract between the agency and the contractor.

(f)Each contracting agency shall cooperate with the Director and the Secretary in the performance of their responsibilities under the act. Such cooperation shall include insuring that the equal opportunity clause is included in all covered Government contracts and that contractors are fully informed of their obligations under the act and this part, providing the Director with any information which comes to the agency's attention that a contractor is not in compliance with the act or this part, responding to requests for information from the Director, and taking such actions for noncompliance as are set forth in § 60&#x2013;741.66 as may be ordered by the Secretary or the Director.

##### Subpart B - Discrimination Prohibited

(c) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;

(d) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;

(e) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;

(f) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the contractor;

(g) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeships, professional meetings, conferences and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;

###### § 60-741.21 Prohibitions.

(a) The termincludes, but is not limited to, the acts described in this section and § 60&#x2013;741.23.

(1)It is unlawful for the contractor to deny an employment opportunity or benefit or otherwise to discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.

(2)Unless otherwise permitted by this part, it is unlawful for the contractor to limit, segregate, or classify a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects his or her employment opportunities or status on the basis of disability. For example, the contractor may not segregate employees into separate work areas or into separate lines of advancement on the basis of disability.

(3)&#x2014;(i)It is unlawful for the contractor to participate in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting the contractor's own qualified applicant or employee with a disability to the discrimination prohibited by this part.

(ii)The phraseincludes, but is not limited to, a relationship with: an employment or referral agency; a labor organization, including a collective bargaining agreement; an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the contractor; or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs.

(iii)This paragraph (a)(3) applies to the contractor, with respect to its own applicants or employees, whether the contractor offered the contract or initiated the relationship, or whether the contractor accepted the contract or acceded to the relationship. The contractor is not liable for the actions of the other party or parties to the contract which only affect that other party's employees or applicants.

(4)It is unlawful for the contractor to use standards, criteria, or methods of administration, that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that:

(i) Have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability; or

(ii) Perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control.

(5)It is unlawful for the contractor to exclude or deny equal jobs or benefits to, or otherwise discriminate against, a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a family, business, social, or other relationship or association.

(6)(i) It is unlawful for the contractor to fail to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability as defined in §§ 60&#x2013;741.2(g)(1)(i) or (ii), unless such contractor can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.

(ii) It is unlawful for the contractor to deny employment opportunities to an otherwise qualified job applicant or employee with a disability based on the need of such contractor to make reasonable accommodation to such an individual's physical or mental impairments.

(iii) The reasonable accommodation obligation extends to the contractor's use of electronic or online job application systems. If a contractor uses such a system, it must provide necessary reasonable accommodation to ensure that an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is not able to fully utilize that system is nonetheless provided with equal opportunity to apply and be considered for all jobs. Though not required by this part, it is a best practice for the contractor to make its online job application system accessible and compatible with assistive technologies used by individuals with disabilities.

(iv) A qualified individual with a disability is not required to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or benefit which such qualified individual chooses not to accept. However, if such individual rejects a reasonable accommodation, aid, service, opportunity or benefit that is necessary to enable the individual to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, and cannot, as a result of that rejection, perform the essential functions of the position, the individual will not be considered a qualified individual with a disability.

(v) A contractor is not required to provide reasonable accommodation to an individual who satisfies only the “regarded as having such an impairment” prong of the definition of “disability,” as defined in § 60- 741.2(v)(1).

(vi)The development and use of written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation is a best practice that may assist the contractor in meeting its reasonable accommodation obligations under section 503 and this part. Such procedures help ensure that applicants and employees are informed as to how to request a reasonable accommodation and are aware of how such a request will be processed by the contractor. They also help ensure that the contractor's supervisors and managers know what to do should they receive a request for reasonable accommodation, and that all requests for accommodation are processed swiftly, within a reasonable period of time. The development and use of written reasonable accommodation procedures is not required by this part, and it is not a violation of this part for a contractor not to have or use such procedures. However, Appendix B of this part provides guidance to contractors that choose to develop and use written reasonable accommodation procedures.

(7)&#x2014;(i)It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, on the basis of disability, unless the standard, test, or other selection criterion, as used by the contractor, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity. Selection criteria that concern an essential function may not be used to exclude an individual with a disability if that individual could satisfy the criteria with provision of a reasonable accommodation. Selection criteria that exclude or tend to exclude an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability but concern only marginal functions of the job would not be consistent with business necessity. The contractor may not refuse to hire an applicant with a disability because the applicant's disability prevents him or her from performing marginal functions.

(ii)It is unlawful for the contractor to use qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria based on an individual's uncorrected vision unless the standard, test, or other selection criteria, as used by the contractor, is shown to be job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. An individual challenging a contractor's application of a qualification standard, test, or other criterion based on uncorrected vision need not be an individual with a disability, but must be adversely affected by the application of the standard, test, or other criterion.

(iii) The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;3, do not apply to the Rehabilitation Act and are similarly inapplicable to this part.

(8)It is unlawful for the contractor to fail to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most effective manner to ensure that, when a test is administered to a job applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor of the applicant or employee that the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills of such employee or applicant, except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.

(9)In offering employment or promotions to individuals with disabilities, it is unlawful for the contractor to reduce the amount of compensation offered because of any income based upon a disability-related pension or other disability-related benefit the applicant or employee receives from another source. Nor may the contractor reduce the amount of compensation offered to an individual with a disability because of the actual or anticipated cost of a reasonable accommodation the individual needs or may request.

(b)Nothing in this part shall provide the basis for a claim that an individual without a disability was subject to discrimination because of the lack of disability, or because an individual with a disability was granted an accommodation that was denied to an individual without a disability.

###### § 60-741.22 Direct threat defense.

The contractor may use as a qualification standard the requirement that an individual be able to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired without posing a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. (See § 60&#x2013;741.2(e) defining)

###### § 60-741.23 Medical examinations and inquiries.

(a)Except as stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, it is unlawful for the contractor to require a medical examination of an applicant or employee or to make inquiries as to whether an applicant or employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability.

(b)&#x2014;(1)The contractor may make pre-employment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-related functions, and/or may ask an applicant to describe or to demonstrate how, with or without reasonable accommodation, the applicant will be able to perform job-related functions.

(2)The contractor may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) after making an offer of employment to a job applicant and before the applicant begins his or her employment duties, and may condition an offer of employment on the results of such examination (and/or inquiry), if all entering employees in the same job category are subjected to such an examination (and/or inquiry) regardless of disability.

(3)The contractor may require a medical examination (and/or inquiry) of an employee that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. The contractor may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.

(4)The contractor may conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, which are part of an employee health program available to employees at the work site. These medical examinations and activities do not have to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.

(5) Medical examinations conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not have to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. However, if certain criteria are used to screen out an applicant or applicants or an employee or employees with disabilities as a result of such examinations or inquiries, the contractor must demonstrate that the exclusionary criteria are job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that performance of the essential job functions cannot be accomplished with reasonable accommodations as required in this part.

(c)The contractor shall invite the applicant to self-identify as an individual with a disability as specified in § 60&#x2013;741.42.

(d)(1) Information obtained under this section regarding the medical condition or history of any applicant or employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and treated as a confidential medical record, except that:

(i) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the applicant or employee and necessary accommodations;

(ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and

(iii) Government officials engaged in enforcing the laws administered by OFCCP, including this part, or enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, shall be provided relevant information on request.

(2) Information obtained under this section regarding the medical condition or history of any applicant or employee shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with this part.

###### § 60-741.24 Drugs and alcohol.

(a)The contractor:

(1) May prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use of alcohol at the workplace by all employees;

(2) May require that employees not be under the influence of alcohol or be engaging in the illegal use of drugs at the workplace;

(3) May require that all employees behave in conformance with the requirements established under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701);

(4) May hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior to which the contractor holds its other employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the employee's drug use or alcoholism;

(5) May require that its employees employed in an industry subject to such regulations comply with the standards established in the regulations (if any) of the Departments of Defense and Transportation, and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other Federal agencies regarding alcohol and the illegal use of drugs; and

(6) May require that employees employed in sensitive positions comply with the regulations (if any) of the Departments of Defense and Transportation, and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other Federal agencies that apply to employment in sensitive positions subject to such regulations.

(b)&#x2014;(1)For purposes of this part, a test to determine the illegal use of drugs is not considered a medical examination. Thus, the administration of such drug tests by the contractor to its job applicants or employees is not a violation of § 60&#x2013;741.23. Nothing in this part shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the contractor to conduct drug tests of job applicants or employees to determine the illegal use of drugs or to make employment decisions based on such test results.

(2)Nothing in this part shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the otherwise lawful exercise by contractors subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation of authority to test employees in, and applicants for, positions involving safety-sensitive duties for the illegal use of drugs or for on-duty impairment by alcohol; and remove from safety-sensitive positions persons who test positive for illegal use of drugs or on-duty impairment by alcohol pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) Any information regarding the medical condition or history of any employee or applicant obtained from a test to determine the illegal use of drugs, except information regarding the illegal use of drugs, is subject to the requirements of § 60&#x2013;741.23(b)(5) and (c).

###### § 60-741.25 Health insurance, life insurance and other benefit plans.

(a) An insurer, hospital, or medical service company, health maintenance organization, or any agent or entity that administers benefit plans, or similar organizations may underwrite risks, classify risks, or administer such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law.

(b) The contractor may establish, sponsor, observe, or administer the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law.

(c) The contractor may establish, sponsor, observe, or administer the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that is not subject to State laws that regulate insurance.

(d) The contractor may not deny an individual with a disability equal access to insurance or subject an individual with a disability to different terms or conditions of insurance based on disability alone, if the disability does not pose increased risks.

(e) The activities described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are permitted unless these activities are used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this part.

##### Subpart C - Affirmative Action Program

###### § 60-741.40 General purpose and applicability of the affirmative action program requirement.

(a)An affirmative action program is a management tool designed to ensure equal employment opportunity and foster employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. An affirmative action program institutionalizes the contractor's commitment to equality in every aspect of employment and is more than a paperwork exercise. An affirmative action program is dynamic in nature and includes measurable objectives, quantitative analyses, and internal auditing and reporting systems that measure the contractor's progress toward achieving equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities.

(b)(1) The requirements of this subpart apply to every Government contractor that has 50 or more employees and a contract of $50,000 or more.

(2) Contractors described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall, within 120 days of the commencement of a contract, prepare and maintain an affirmative action program at each establishment. The affirmative action program shall set forth the contractor's policies and procedures in accordance with this part. This program may be integrated into or kept separate from other affirmative action programs.

(3) The affirmative action program shall be reviewed and updated annually by the official designated by the contractor pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.44(i).

(c)The contractor shall submit the affirmative action program within 30 days of a request from OFCCP, unless the request provides for a different time. The contractor also shall make the affirmative action program promptly available on-site upon OFCCP's request.

###### § 60-741.41 Availability of affirmative action program.

The full affirmative action program, absent the data metrics required by § 60&#x2013;741.44(k), shall be available to any employee or applicant for employment for inspection upon request. The location and hours during which the program may be obtained shall be posted at each establishment.

###### § 60-741.42 Invitation to self-identify.

(a)(1) As part of the contractor's affirmative action obligation, the contractor shall invite applicants to inform the contractor whether the applicant believes that he or she is an individual with a disability as defined in § 60&#x2013;741.2(g)(1)(i) or (ii). This invitation shall be provided to each applicant when the applicant applies or is considered for employment. The invitation may be included with the application materials for a position, but must be separate from the application.

(2) The contractor shall invite an applicant to self-identify as required in paragraph (a) of this section using the language and manner prescribed by the Director and published on the OFCCP Web site.

(b)(1) At any time after the offer of employment, but before the applicant begins his or her job duties, the contractor shall invite the applicant to inform the contractor whether the applicant believes that he or she is an individual with a disability as defined in § 60&#x2013;741.2(g)(1)(i) or (ii).

(2) The contractor shall invite an applicant to self-identify as required in paragraph (b) of this section using the language and manner prescribed by the Director and published on the OFCCP Web site.

(c)The contractor shall invite each of its employees to voluntarily inform the contractor whether the employee believes that he or she is an individual with a disability as defined in § 60&#x2013;741.2(g)(1)(i) or (ii). This invitation shall be extended the first year the contractor becomes subject to the requirements of this section and at five year intervals, thereafter, using the language and manner prescribed by the Director and published on the OFCCP Web site. At least once during the intervening years between these invitations, the contractor must remind their employees that they may voluntarily update their disability status.

(d) The contractor may not compel or coerce an individual to self-identify as an individual with a disability.

(e) The contractor shall keep all information on self-identification confidential, and shall maintain it in a data analysis file (rather than in the medical files of individual employees).§ 60&#x2013;741.23(d). The contractor shall provide self-identification information to OFCCP upon request. Self-identification information may be used only in accordance with this part.

(f) Nothing in this section shall relieve the contractor of its obligation to take affirmative action with respect to those applicants or employees of whose disability the contractor has knowledge.

(g) Nothing in this section shall relieve the contractor from liability for discrimination in violation of section 503 or this part.

###### § 60-741.43 Affirmative action policy.

Under the affirmative action obligations imposed by the act, contractors shall not discriminate because of physical or mental disability and shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities at all levels of employment, including the executive level. Such action shall apply to all employment activities set forth in § 60&#x2013;741.20.

###### § 60-741.44 Required contents of affirmative action programs.

Acceptable affirmative action programs shall contain, but not necessarily be limited to the following elements:

(a)The contractor shall include an equal opportunity policy statement in its affirmative action program, and shall post the policy statement on company bulletin boards. The contractor must ensure that applicants and employees with disabilities are provided the notice in a form that is accessible and understandable to the individual with a disability (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice, or posting a copy of the notice at a lower height for easy viewing by a person using a wheelchair). The policy statement shall indicate the top United States executive's (such as the Chief Executive Officer or the President of the United States Division of a foreign company) support for the contractor's affirmative action program, provide for an audit and reporting system (see paragraph (h) of this section) and assign overall responsibility for the implementation of affirmative action activities required under this part (see paragraph (i) of this section). Additionally, the policy shall state, among other things that the contractor will: recruit, hire, train, and promote persons in all job titles, and ensure that all other personnel actions are administered without regard to disability; and ensure that all employment decisions are based only on valid job requirements. The policy shall state that employees and applicants shall not be subjected to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination because they have engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;

(2) Assisting or participating in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of section 503 or any other Federal, State, or local law requiring equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities;

(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by section 503 or its implementing regulations in this part, or any other Federal, State or local law requiring equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities; or

(4) Exercising any other right protected by section 503 or its implementing regulations in this part.

(b)The contractor shall ensure that its personnel processes provide for careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of applicants and employees with known disabilities for job vacancies filled either by hiring or promotion, and for all training opportunities offered or available. The contractor shall ensure that its personnel processes do not stereotype individuals with disabilities in a manner which limits their access to all jobs for which they are qualified. In addition, the contractor shall ensure that applicants and employees with disabilities have equal access to its personnel processes, including those implemented through information and communication technologies. The contractor is required to provide necessary reasonable accommodation to ensure applicants and employees with disabilities receive equal opportunity in the operation of personnel processes. The contractor is also encouraged to make its information and communication technologies accessible, even absent a specific request for reasonable accommodation.The contractor shall periodically review such processes and make any necessary modifications to ensure that these obligations are carried out. A description of the review and any necessary modifications to personnel processes or development of new processes shall be included in any affirmative action programs required under this part. The contractor must design procedures that facilitate a review of the implementation of this requirement by the contractor and the Government.

(c)(1) The contractor shall provide in its affirmative action program, and shall adhere to, a schedule for the review of all physical and mental job qualification standards to ensure that, to the extent qualification standards tend to screen out qualified individuals with disabilities, they are job-related for the position in question and are consistent with business necessity.

(2) Whenever the contractor applies physical or mental qualification standards in the selection of applicants or employees for employment or other change in employment status such as promotion, demotion or training, to the extent that qualification standards tend to screen out qualified individuals on the basis of disability, the standards shall be related to the specific job or jobs for which the individual is being considered and consistent with business necessity. The contractor shall have the burden to demonstrate that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph (c).

(3) The contractor may use as a defense to an allegation of a violation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section that an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. (§ 60&#x2013;741.2(e) defining direct threat.)

(d)(1) As is provided in § 60&#x2013;741.21(a)(6), as a matter of nondiscrimination, the contractor must make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business. As a matter of affirmative action, if an employee with a known disability is having significant difficulty performing his or her job and it is reasonable to conclude that the performance problem may be related to the known disability, the contractor shall confidentially notify the employee of the performance problem and inquire whether the problem is related to the employee's disability. If the employee responds affirmatively, the contractor shall confidentially inquire whether the employee is in need of a reasonable accommodation.

(2)The development and use of written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation is a best practice that may assist the contractor in meeting its reasonable accommodation obligations under section 503 and this part. Such procedures help ensure that applicants and employees are informed as to how to request a reasonable accommodation and are aware of how such a request will be processed by the contractor. They also help ensure that the contractor's supervisors and managers know what to do should they receive a request for reasonable accommodation, and that all requests for accommodation are processed swiftly, within a reasonable period of time. The development and use of written reasonable accommodation procedures is not required by this part, and it is not a violation of this part for a contractor not to have or use such procedures. However, Appendix B of this part provides guidance to contractors that choose to develop and use written reasonable accommodation procedures.

(e)The contractor must develop and implement procedures to ensure that its employees are not harassed on the basis of disability.

(f)&#x2014;(1)(i) The contractor shall undertake appropriate outreach and positive recruitment activities such as those listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section that are reasonably designed to effectively recruit qualified individuals with disabilities. It is not contemplated that the contractor will necessarily undertake all the activities listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or that its activities will be limited to those listed. The scope of the contractor's efforts shall depend upon all the circumstances, including the contractor's size and resources and the extent to which existing employment practices are adequate.

(ii) The contractor must send written notification of company policy related to its affirmative action efforts to all subcontractors, including subcontracting vendors and suppliers, requesting appropriate action on their part.

(2) Examples ofBelow are examples of outreach and positive recruitment activities referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

(i) Enlisting the assistance and support of the following persons and organizations in recruiting, and developing on-the-job training opportunities for individuals with disabilities, in order to fulfill its commitment to provide equal employment opportunity for such individuals:

(A) The State Vocational Rehabilitation Service Agency (SVRA), State mental health agency, or State developmental disability agency in the area of the contractor's establishment;

(B) The Employment One-Stop Career Center (One-Stop) or American Job Center nearest the contractor's establishment;

(C) The Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office nearest the contractor's establishment ();

(D) Entities funded by the Department of Labor that provide recruitment or training services for individuals with disabilities, such as the services currently provided through the Employer Assistance and Resource Network (EARN) ();

(E) Local Employment Network (EN) organizations (other than the contractor, if the contractor is an EN) listed in the Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Employment Network Directory ();

(F) Local disability groups, organizations, or Centers for Independent Living (CIL) near the contractor's establishment;

(G) Placement or career offices of educational institutions that specialize in the placement of individuals with disabilities; and

(H) Private recruitment sources, such as professional organizations or employment placement services that specialize in the placement of individuals with disabilities.

(ii) The contractor should also consider taking the actions listed below to fulfill its commitment to provide equal employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities:

(A) Formal briefing sessions should be held, preferably on company premises, with representatives from recruiting sources. Contractor facility tours, clear and concise explanations of current and future job openings, position descriptions, worker specifications, explanations of the company's selection process, and recruiting literature should be an integral part of the briefing. At any such briefing sessions, the company official in charge of the contractor's affirmative action program should be in attendance when possible. Formal arrangements should be made for referral of applicants, follow up with sources, and feedback on disposition of applicants.

(B) The contractor's recruitment efforts at all educational institutions should incorporate special efforts to reach students who are individuals with disabilities.

(C) An effort should be made to participate in work-study programs for students, trainees, or interns with disabilities. Such programs may be found through outreach to State and local schools and universities, and through EARN.

(D) Individuals with disabilities should be made available for participation in career days, youth motivation programs, and related activities in their communities.

(E) The contractor should take any other positive steps it deems necessary to attract individuals with disabilities not currently in the work force who have requisite skills and can be recruited through affirmative action measures. These individuals may be located through State and local agencies supported by the U.S. Department of Education's Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) (), local Ticket-to-Work Employment Networks, or local chapters of groups or organizations that provide services for individuals with disabilities.

(F) The contractor, in making hiring decisions, should consider applicants who are known to have disabilities for all available positions for which they may be qualified when the position(s) applied for is unavailable.

(3)The contractor shall, on an annual basis, review the outreach and recruitment efforts it has taken over the previous twelve months to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying and recruiting qualified individuals with disabilities. The contractor shall document each evaluation, including at a minimum the criteria it used to evaluate the effectiveness of each effort and the contractor's conclusion as to whether each effort was effective. Among these criteria shall be the data collected pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section for the current year and the two most recent previous years. The contractor's conclusion as to the effectiveness of its outreach efforts must be reasonable as determined by OFCCP in light of these regulations. If the contractor concludes the totality of its efforts were not effective in identifying and recruiting qualified individuals with disabilities, it shall identify and implement alternative efforts listed in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section in order to fulfill its obligations.

(4)The contractor shall document all activities it undertakes to comply with the obligations of this section, and retain these documents for a period of three (3) years.

(g)(1) A strong outreach program will be ineffective without adequate internal support from supervisory and management personnel and other employees. In order to assure greater employee cooperation and participation in the contractor's efforts, the contractor shall develop the internal procedures listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for communication of its obligation to engage in affirmative action efforts to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. It is not contemplated that the contractor's activities will be limited to those listed. These procedures shall be designed to foster understanding, acceptance and support among the contractor's executive, management, supervisory, and other employees and to encourage such persons to take the necessary actions to aid the contractor in meeting this obligation.

(2) The contractor shall implement and disseminate this policy internally as follows:

(i) Include it in the contractor's policy manual or otherwise make the policy available to employees;

(ii) If the contractor is a party to a collective bargaining agreement, it shall notify union officials and/or employee representatives of the contractor's policy and request their cooperation;

(3) The contractor is encouraged to additionally implement and disseminate this policy internally as follows:

(i) Inform all employees and prospective employees of its commitment to engage in affirmative action to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The contractor should periodically schedule special meetings with all employees to discuss policy and explain individual employee responsibilities;

(ii) Publicize it in the company newspaper, magazine, annual report and other media;

(iii) Conduct special meetings with executive, management, and supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and individual responsibility for effective implementation making clear the chief executive officer's support for the affirmative action policy;

(iv) Discuss the policy thoroughly in both employee orientation and management training programs;

(v) Include articles on accomplishments of individuals with disabilities in company publications; and

(vi) When employees are featured in employee handbooks or similar publications for employees, include individuals with disabilities.

(h)(1) The contractor shall design and implement an audit and reporting system that will:

(i) Measure the effectiveness of the contractor's affirmative action program;

(ii) Indicate any need for remedial action;

(iii) Determine the degree to which the contractor's objectives have been attained;

(iv) Determine whether known individuals with disabilities have had the opportunity to participate in all company sponsored educational, training, recreational, and social activities;

(v) Measure the contractor's compliance with the affirmative action program's specific obligations; and

(vi) Document the actions taken to comply with the obligations of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, and retain these documents as employment records subject to the recordkeeping requirements of § 60&#x2013;741.80.

(2) Where the affirmative action program is found to be deficient, the contractor shall undertake necessary action to bring the program into compliance.

(i)An official of the contractor shall be assigned responsibility for implementation of the contractor's affirmative action activities under this part. His or her identity should appear on all internal and external communications regarding the company's affirmative action program. This official shall be given necessary senior management support and staff to manage the implementation of this program.

(j)All personnel involved in the recruitment, screening, selection, promotion, disciplinary, and related processes shall be trained to ensure that the commitments in the contractor's affirmative action program are implemented.

(k)The contractor shall document the following computations or comparisons pertaining to applicants and hires on an annual basis and maintain them for a period of three (3) years:

(1) The number of applicants who self-identified as individuals with disabilities pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.42(a), or who are otherwise known to be individuals with disabilities;

(2) The total number of job openings and total number of jobs filled;

(3) The total number of applicants for all jobs;

(4) The number of applicants with disabilities hired; and

(5) The total number of applicants hired.

###### § 60-741.45 Utilization goals.

The utilization goal is not a rigid and inflexible quota which must be met, nor is it to be considered either a ceiling or a floor for the employment of particular groups. Quotas are expressly forbidden.

(a)OFCCP has established a utilization goal of 7 percent for employment of qualified individuals with disabilities for each job group in the contractor's workforce, or for the contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

(b)The purpose of the utilization goal is to establish a benchmark against which the contractor must measure the representation of individuals within each job group in its workforce, or within the contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. The utilization goal serves as an equal employment opportunity objective that should be attainable by complying with all aspects of the affirmative action requirements of this part.

(c)The Director of OFCCP shall periodically review and update, as appropriate, the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d)&#x2014;(1)The utilization analysis is designed to evaluate the representation of individuals with disabilities in each job group within the contractor's workforce, or to evaluate the representation of individuals with disabilities in the contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, with the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2)The contractor must use the same job groups established for utilization analyses under Executive Order 11246, either in accordance with 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;2, or in accordance with 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;4, as appropriate, except as provided below.

(i)If a contractor has a total workforce of 100 or fewer employees, it need not use the jobs groups established for utilization analyses under Executive Order 11246, and has the option to measure the representation of individuals with disabilities in its entire workforce with the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section.

(ii) [Reserved]

(3)The contractor shall annually evaluate its utilization of individuals with disabilities in each job group, or in its entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

(e)When the percentage of individuals with disabilities in one or more job groups, or in a contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, is less than the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section, the contractor must take steps to determine whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. When making this determination, the contractor must assess its personnel processes, the effectiveness of its outreach and recruitment efforts, the results of its affirmative action program audit, and any other areas that might affect the success of the affirmative action program.

(f)The contractor must develop and execute action-oriented programs designed to correct any identified problems areas. These action-oriented programs may include the modification of personnel processes to ensure equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities, alternative or additional outreach and recruitment efforts from among those listed in § 60&#x2013;741.44 (f)(1) and (f)(2), and/or other actions designed to correct the identified problem areas and attain the established goal.

(g) A contractor's determination that it has not attained the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section in one or more job groups does not constitute either a finding or admission of discrimination in violation of this part.

(h) The utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be used as a quota or ceiling that limits or restricts the employment of individuals with disabilities.

###### § 60-741.46 Voluntary affirmative action programs for employees with disabilities.

(a) The contractor is permitted to develop and implement training and employment for employees with disabilities. Examples include, developing a job training program focused on the specific needs of individuals with certain disabilities such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or developmental disabilities and utilizing linkage agreements to recruit program trainees. Successful programs such as these have been developed by some contractors and OFCCP desires to make clear they are permissible, though not required.

(1) If a contractor elects to implement a voluntary affirmative action program for employees with disabilities, a description of the program and the policies governing the program, including the name and title of the official responsible for the program, shall be included in the contractor's written affirmative action program. An annual report describing the contractor's activities pursuant to the program and identifying the outcomes achieved should also be included in the contractor's affirmative action program.

(2) Disability-related information from the applicant and/or employee self-identification request required by § 60&#x2013;741.42 may be used to identify individuals with disabilities who are eligible to benefit from a voluntary affirmative action program for employees with disabilities.

(b) The contractor shall not use such programs to segregate individuals with disabilities or to limit or restrict the employment opportunities of any individual with a disability.

(c) The contractor shall not discriminate against an individual with a disability who has participated in a voluntary affirmative action program for employees with disabilities with respect to any term, condition, or benefit of employment, including, but not limited to, employment acts such as compensation, promotion, and termination, that are listed in § 60&#x2013;741.20.

(d) These voluntary training and development programs should not result in discrimination against other groups and do not relieve a contractor from liability for discrimination under this act, Executive Order 11246, or the Vietnam Era Vetrans' Readjustment Assistance Act.

###### § 60-741.47 Sheltered workshops.

Contracts with sheltered workshops do not constitute affirmative action in lieu of employment and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities in the contractor's own work force. Contracts with sheltered workshops may be included within an affirmative action program if the sheltered workshop trains employees for the contractor and the contractor is obligated to hire trainees at full compensation when such trainees become “qualified individuals with disabilities.”

##### Subpart D - General Enforcement and Complaint Procedures

###### § 60-741.60 Compliance evaluations.

(a) OFCCP may conduct compliance evaluations to determine if the contractor is taking affirmative action to employ, advance in employment, and otherwise treat qualified individuals without discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. A compliance evaluation may consist of any one or any combination of the following investigative procedures:

(1)A comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the hiring and employment practices of the contractor, the written affirmative action program, and the results of the affirmative action efforts undertaken by the contractor. A compliance review may proceed in three stages:

(i) A desk audit of the written affirmative action program and supporting documentation to determine whether all elements required by the regulations in this part are included, whether the affirmative action program meets agency standards of reasonableness, and whether the affirmative action program and supporting documentation satisfy agency standards of acceptability. OFCCP may extend the temporal scope of the desk audit beyond that set forth in the scheduling letter if OFCCP deems it necessary to carry out its investigation of potential violations of this part. The desk audit is conducted at OFCCP offices;

(ii) An on-site review is conducted at the contractor's establishment to investigate unresolved problem areas identified in the affirmative action program and supporting documentation during the desk audit, to verify that the contractor has implemented the affirmative action program and has complied with those regulatory obligations not required to be included in the affirmative action program, and to examine potential instances or issues of discrimination. An on-site review normally will involve an examination of the contractor's personnel and employment policies, inspection and copying of documents related to employment actions, and interviews with employees, supervisors, managers, hiring officials; and

(iii) Where necessary, an off-site analysis of information supplied by the contractor or otherwise gathered during or pursuant to the on-site review;

(2)An analysis and evaluation of the affirmative action program (or any part thereof) and supporting documentation, and other documents related to the contractor's personnel policies and employment actions that may be relevant to a determination of whether the contractor has complied with the requirements of section 503 and its regulations;

(3)A determination of whether the contractor has maintained records consistent with § 60&#x2013;741.80; OFCCP may request the documents be provided either on-site or off-site; or

(4)A review restricted to one or more components of the contractor's organization or one or more aspects of the contractor's employment practices.

(b) Where deficiencies are found to exist, reasonable efforts shall be made to secure compliance through conciliation and persuasion pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.62.

(c)Each agency will include in the invitation for bids for each formally advertised nonconstruction contract or state at the outset of negotiations for each negotiated contract, that if the award, when let, should total $10 million or more, the prospective contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with subcontracts of $10 million or more will be subject to a compliance evaluation before the award of the contract unless OFCCP has conducted an evaluation and found them to be in compliance with section 503 within the preceding 24 months. The awarding agency will notify OFCCP and request appropriate action and findings in accordance with this subsection. Within 15 days of the notice, OFCCP will inform the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation. If OFCCP does not inform the awarding agency within that period of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation, clearance shall be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award. If OFCCP informs the awarding agency of its intention to conduct a pre-award compliance evaluation, OFCCP will be allowed an additional 20 days after the date that it so informs the awarding agency to provide its conclusions. If OFCCP does not provide the awarding agency with its conclusions within that period, clearance will be presumed and the awarding agency is authorized to proceed with the award.

###### § 60-741.61 Complaint procedures.

(a)Pursuant to section 107(b) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), OFCCP and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have promulgated regulations setting forth procedures governing the processing of complaints falling within the overlapping jurisdiction of both the act and title I of the ADA to ensure that such complaints are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents the imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards. Complaints filed under this part will be processed in accordance with those regulations, which are found at 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;742, and with this part.

(b)Any applicant for employment with a contractor or any employee of a contractor may, personally, or by an authorized representative, file a written complaint with the Director alleging a violation of the act or the regulations in this part. The complaint may allege individual or class-wide violation(s). Complaints may be submitted to the OFCCP, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room C&#x2013;3325, Washington, DC 20210, or to any OFCCP regional, district, or area office. Such complaint must be filed within 300 days of the date of the alleged violation, unless the time for filing is extended by OFCCP for good cause shown.

(c)&#x2014;(1)A complaint must be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following information:

(i) Name and address (including telephone number) of the complainant;

(ii) Name and address of the contractor who committed the alleged violation;

(iii) The facts showing that the individual has a disability, a record or history of a disability, or was regarded by the contractor as having a disability;

(iv) A description of the act or acts considered to be a violation, including the pertinent dates (in the case of an alleged continuing violation, the earliest and most recent date that the alleged violation occurred should be stated); and

(v) Other pertinent information available which will assist in the investigation and resolution of the complaint, including the name of any known Federal agency with which the employer has contracted.

(2)When a written complaint is filed by an authorized representative, that complaint need not identify by name the person on whose behalf it is filed. However, the authorized representative must nonetheless provide the name, address and telephone number of the person on whose behalf the complaint is filed to OFCCP, along with the other information specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. OFCCP shall verify the authorization of such complaint with the person on whose behalf the complaint is filed. Any such person may request that OFCCP keep his or her identity confidential during the investigation of the complaint, and OFCCP will protect the individual's confidentiality wherever that is possible given the facts and circumstances in the complaint.

(d)Where a complaint contains incomplete information, OFCCP shall seek the needed information from the complainant. If the information is not furnished to OFCCP within 60 days of the date of such request, the case may be closed.

(e)The Department of Labor shall institute a prompt investigation of each complaint.

(f)(1) If the complaint investigation finds no violation of the act or this part, or if the Director decides not to refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor for enforcement proceedings against the contractor pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.65(a)(l), the complainant and contractor shall be so notified. The Director, on his or her own initiative, may reconsider his or her determination or the determination of any of his or her designated officers who have authority to issue Notifications of Results of Investigation.

(2) The Director will review all determinations of no violation that involve complaints that are not also cognizable under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(3) In cases where the Director decides to reconsider the determination of a Notification of Results of Investigation, the Director shall provide prompt notification of his or her intent to reconsider, which is effective upon issuance, and his or her final determination after reconsideration to the person claiming to be aggrieved, the person making the complaint on behalf of such person, if any, and the contractor.

(4) If the investigation finds a violation of the act or this part, OFCCP shall invite the contractor to participate in conciliation discussions pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.62.

###### § 60-741.62 Resolution procedures.

(a)If a compliance review or other review by OFCCP indicates evidence sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice, subject to the following parameters and the approval of the Director or acting agency head:

(1) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate treatment theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate that the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Provide qualitative evidence as defined in this part that, in combination with other evidence, supports both a finding of discriminatory intent by the contractor and a finding that the contractor's discriminatory intent caused the disparate treatment.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Predetermination Notice under a disparate treatment theory of liability without satisfying all three components listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if:

(i) The qualitative evidence by itself is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment;

(ii) The evidence of disparity between a favored and disfavored group is so extraordinarily compelling that by itself it is sufficient to support a preliminary finding of disparate treatment; or

(iii) Paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and the contractor denied OFCCP access to sources of evidence that may be relevant to a preliminary finding of discriminatory intent. This may include denying access to its employees during a compliance evaluation or destroying or failing to produce records the contractor is legally required to create and maintain.

(3) For allegations included in a Predetermination Notice involving a disparate impact theory of liability, OFCCP must:

(i) Provide quantitative evidence as defined in this part;

(ii) Demonstrate the unexplained disparity is practically significant; and

(iii) Identify the specific policy or practice of the contractor causing the adverse impact, unless OFCCP can demonstrate that the elements of the contractor's selection procedures are incapable of separation for analysis.

(4) The Predetermination Notice must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Predetermination Notice; however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Predetermination Notice based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation for why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(5) Any response to a Predetermination Notice must be submitted by the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Notice, which deadline OFCCP may extend for good cause.

(b)(1) If, following OFCCP's review of any response by the contractor pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the agency has evidence sufficient to support a finding of disparate treatment and/or disparate impact discrimination, as established in the parameters and exceptions in paragraph (a) of this section, or that the contractor has committed other material violations of the equal opportunity clause (with the exception of violations for denying access or failing to submit records in response to OFCCP's Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-approved Scheduling Letters, for which OFCCP may proceed directly to issuing a Show Cause Notice), OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation to the contractor requiring corrective action and inviting conciliation through a written agreement, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head.

(2) OFCCP may issue a Notice of Violation alleging a finding of discrimination following issuance of a Predetermination Notice if the contractor does not respond or provide a sufficient response within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Predetermination Notice, subject to approval by the Director or acting agency head, unless OFCCP has extended the Predetermination Notice response time for good cause shown.

(3) The Notice of Violation must disclose the quantitative and qualitative evidence relied on by OFCCP in sufficient detail to allow contractors to investigate allegations and meaningfully respond. OFCCP will seek to obtain qualitative evidence in all cases in which it issues a Notice of Violation, however, if the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section applies, OFCCP will disclose why, in the absence of qualitative evidence, the agency is issuing the Notice of Violation based on evidence of an extraordinarily compelling disparity alone. In addition, upon the contractor's request, OFCCP must also provide the model and variables used in any statistical analysis and an explanation why any variable proposed by the contractor was excluded from that analysis. However, OFCCP may withhold personal identifying information from the description of the qualitative evidence if the information is protected from disclosure under recognized governmental privileges, or otherwise if providing that information would violate confidentiality or privacy protections afforded by law.

(4) The Notice of Violation must address all relevant concerns and defenses raised by the contractor in response to the Predetermination Notice.

(c)If a compliance review, complaint investigation, or other review by OFCCP or its representative indicates a material violation of the equal opportunity clause, and:

(1) If the contractor, subcontractor or bidder is willing to correct the violations and/or deficiencies; and

(2) If OFCCP or its representative determines that settlement (rather than referral for consideration of formal enforcement) is appropriate, a written agreement shall be required. The agreement shall provide for such remedial action as may be necessary to correct the violations and/or deficiencies noted, including, where appropriate (but not necessarily limited to), remedies such as back pay and retroactive seniority.

(d)The remedial action referenced in paragraph (c) of this section may include the establishment of benchmarks for the contractor's outreach, recruitment, hiring, or other employment activities. The purpose of such benchmarks is to create a quantifiable method by which the contractor's progress in correcting identified violations and/or deficiencies can be measured.

(e)A contractor may voluntarily waive the procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section to enter directly into a conciliation agreement. OFCCP may inform the contractor of this expedited conciliation option, but may not require or insist that the contractor avail itself of the expedited conciliation option.

(f)Should a court of competent jurisdiction hold any provision(s) of this section to be invalid, such action will not affect any other provision of this section.

###### § 60-741.63 Violations of conciliation agreements.

(a) When OFCCP believes that a conciliation agreement has been violated, the following procedures are applicable:

(1) A written notice shall be sent to the contractor setting forth the violation alleged and summarizing the supporting evidence. The contractor shall have 15 days from receipt of the notice to respond, except in those cases in which OFCCP asserts that such a delay would result in irreparable injury to the employment rights of affected employees or applicants.

(2) During the 15-day period the contractor may demonstrate in writing that it has not violated its commitments.

(b) In those cases in which OFCCP asserts that a delay would result in irreparable injury to the employment rights of affected employees or applicants, enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately without proceeding through any other requirement contained in this chapter.

(c) In any proceedings involving an alleged violation of a conciliation agreement, OFCCP may seek enforcement of the agreement itself and shall not be required to present proof of the underlying violations resolved by the agreement.

###### § 60-741.64 Show cause notices.

When the Director has reasonable cause to believe that the contractor has violated the act or this part, he or she may issue a notice requiring the contractor to show cause, within 30 days, why monitoring, enforcement proceedings, or other appropriate action to ensure compliance should not be instituted. The issuance of such a notice is not a prerequisite to instituting enforcement proceedings (see § 60&#x2013;741.65).

###### § 60-741.65 Enforcement proceedings.

(a)(1) If a compliance evaluation, complaint investigation, or other review by OFCCP finds a violation of the act or this part, and the violation has not been corrected in accordance with the conciliation procedures in this part, or OFCCP determines that referral for consideration of formal enforcement (rather than settlement) is appropriate, OFCCP may refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor with a recommendation for the institution of enforcement proceedings to enjoin the violations, to seek appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions, or any combination of these outcomes. OFCCP may seek back pay and other make whole relief for aggrieved individuals identified during a complaint investigation or compliance review. Such individuals need not have filed a complaint as a prerequisite to OFCCP seeking such relief on their behalf. Interest on back pay shall be calculated from the date of the loss and compounded quarterly at the percentage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the underpayment of taxes.

(2) In addition to the administrative proceedings set forth in this section, the Director may, within the limitations of applicable law, seek appropriate judicial action to enforce the contractual provisions set forth in § 60&#x2013;741.5, including appropriate injunctive relief.

(b)(1) In administrative enforcement proceedings the contractor shall be provided an opportunity for a formal hearing. All hearings conducted under the act and this part shall be governed by the Rules of Practice for Administrative Proceedings to Enforce Equal Opportunity Under Executive Order 11246 contained in 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;30 and the Rules of Evidence set out in the Rules of Practice and Procedure for Administrative Hearings Before the Office of Administrative Law Judges contained in 29 CFR part 18, subpart B:That a final administrative order shall be issued within one year from the date of the issuance of the recommended findings, conclusions, and decision of the Administrative Law Judge, or the submission of any exceptions and responses to exceptions to such decision (if any) whichever is later.

(2) Complaints may be filed by the Solicitor, the Associate Solicitor for Civil Rights and Labor-Management, Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors.

(3) For the purposes of hearings pursuant to this part, references in 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;30 to “Executive Order 11246” shall mean section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; references to “equal opportunity clause'” shall mean the equal opportunity clause published at § 60&#x2013;741.5; and references to “regulations” shall mean the regulations contained in this part.

###### § 60-741.66 Sanctions and penalties.

(a)With the prior approval of the Director, so much of the accrued payment due on the contract or any other contract between the Government contractor and the Federal Government may be withheld as necessary to correct any violations of the provisions of the act or this part.

(b)A contract may be canceled or terminated, in whole or in part, for failure to comply with the provisions of the act or this part.

(c)A contractor may be debarred from receiving future contracts for failure to comply with the provisions of the act or this part subject to reinstatement pursuant to § 60&#x2013;741.68. Debarment may be imposed for an indefinite period, or may be imposed for a fixed period of not less than six months, but no more than three years.

(d)An opportunity for a formal hearing shall be afforded to a contractor before the imposition of any sanction or penalty.

###### § 60-741.67 Notification of agencies.

The Director shall ensure that the heads of all agencies are notified of any debarments taken against any contractor.

###### § 60-741.68 Reinstatement of ineligible contractors.

(a)A contractor debarred from further contracts for an indefinite period under the act may request reinstatement in a letter filed with the Director at any time after the effective date of the debarment; a contractor debarred for a fixed period may make such a request following the expiration of six months from the effective date of the debarment. In connection with the reinstatement proceedings, all debarred contractors shall be required to show that they have established and will carry out employment policies and practices in compliance with the act and this part. Additionally, in determining whether reinstatement is appropriate for a contractor debarred for a fixed period, the Director also shall consider, among other factors, the severity of the violation which resulted in the debarment, the contractor's attitude towards compliance, the contractor's past compliance history, and whether the contractor's reinstatement would impede the effective enforcement of the act or this part. Before reaching a decision, the Director may conduct a compliance evaluation of the contractor and may require the contractor to supply additional information regarding the request for reinstatement. The Director shall issue a written decision on the request.

(b)Within 30 days of its receipt of a decision denying a request for reinstatement, the contractor may file a petition for review of the decision with the Secretary. The petition shall set forth the grounds for the contractor's objections to the Director's decision. The petition shall be served on the Director and the Associate Solicitor for Civil Rights and Labor-Management and shall include the decision as an appendix. The Director may file a response within 14 days to the petition. The Secretary shall issue the final agency decision denying or granting the request for reinstatement. Before reaching a final decision, the Secretary may issue such additional orders respecting procedure as he or she finds appropriate in the circumstances, including an order referring the matter to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for an evidentiary hearing where there is a material factual dispute that cannot be resolved on the record before the Secretary.

###### § 60-741.69 Intimidation and interference.

(a) The contractor shall not harass, intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual because the individual has engaged in or may engage in any of the following activities:

(1) Filing a complaint;

(2) Assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing, or any other activity related to the administration of the act or any other Federal, State, or local law requiring equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities;

(3) Opposing any act or practice made unlawful by the act or this part or any other Federal, State, or local law requiring equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities; or

(4) Exercising any other right protected by the act or this part.

(b) The contractor shall ensure that all persons under its control do not engage in such harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination. The sanctions and penalties contained in this part may be exercised by the Director against any contractor who violates this obligation.

###### § 60-741.70 Disputed matters related to compliance with the act.

The procedures set forth in the regulations in this part govern all disputes relative to the contractor's compliance with the act and this part. Any disputes relating to issues other than compliance, including contract costs arising out of the contractor's efforts to comply, shall be determined by the disputes clause of the contract.

##### Subpart E - Ancillary Matters

###### § 60-741.80 Recordkeeping.

(a)Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, any personnel or employment record made or kept by the contractor shall be preserved by the contractor for a period of two years from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. However, if the contractor has fewer than 150 employees or does not have a Government contract of at least $150,000, the minimum record retention period shall be one year from the date of the making of the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later, except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Such records include, but are not necessarily limited to, records relating to requests for reasonable accommodation; the results of any physical examination; job advertisements and postings; applications and resumes; tests and test results; interview notes; and other records having to do with hiring, assignment, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination, rates of pay or other terms of compensation, and selection for training or apprenticeship. In the case of involuntary termination of an employee, the personnel records of the individual terminated shall be kept for a period of two years from the date of the termination, except that contractors that have fewer than 150 employees or that do not have a Government contract of at least $150,000 shall keep such records for a period of one year from the date of the termination. Where the contractor has received notice that a complaint of discrimination has been filed, that a compliance evaluation has been initiated, or that an enforcement action has been commenced, the contractor must preserve all personnel records relevant to the complaint, compliance evaluation, or action until final disposition of the complaint, compliance evaluation or action. The term “personnel records relevant to the complaint, compliance evaluation, or action” will include, for example, personnel or employment records relating to the aggrieved person and to all other employees holding positions similar to that held or sought by the aggrieved person and application forms or test papers completed by an unsuccessful applicant and by all other candidates for the same position as that for which the aggrieved person applied and was rejected.

(b)Records required by § 60&#x2013;741.44(f)(4) and (k) shall be maintained by all contractors for a period of three years from the date of the making of the record.

(c)Failure to preserve complete and accurate records as required by this part constitutes noncompliance with the contractor's obligations under the act and this part. Where the contractor has destroyed or failed to preserve records as required by this section, there may be a presumption that the information destroyed or not preserved would have been unfavorable to the contractor:That this presumption shall not apply where the contractor shows that the destruction or failure to preserve records results from circumstances that are outside of the contractor's control.

###### § 60-741.81 Access to records.

Each contractor shall permit access during normal business hours to its places of business for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance evaluations and complaint investigations and inspecting and copying such books, accounts, and records, including electronic records, and any other material OFCCP deems relevant to the matter under investigation and pertinent to compliance with the act or this part. Contractors must also provide OFCCP access to these materials, including electronic records, off-site for purposes of conducting compliance evaluations and complaint investigations. Upon request, the contractor must provide OFCCP information about all format(s), including specific electronic formats, in which the contractor maintains its records and other information. The contractor must provide records and other information in any of the formats in which they are maintained, as selected by OFCCP. Information obtained in this manner shall be used only in connection with the administration of the act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), and in furtherance of the purposes of the act and the ADA. OFCCP will treat records provided by the contractor to OFCCP under this section as confidential to the maximum extent the information is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

###### § 60-741.82 Labor organizations and recruiting and training agencies.

(a) Whenever performance in accordance with the equal opportunity clause or any matter contained in the regulations in this part may necessitate a revision of a collective bargaining agreement, the labor organizations which are parties to such agreement shall be given an adequate opportunity to present their views to OFCCP.

(b) OFCCP shall use its best efforts, directly or through contractors, subcontractors, local officials, vocational rehabilitation facilities, and all other available instrumentalities, to cause any labor organization, recruiting and training agency, or other representative of workers who are employed by a contractor to cooperate with, and to assist in, the implementation of the purposes of the act.

###### § 60-741.83 Rulings and interpretations.

Rulings under or interpretations of the act and this part shall be made by the Director.

#### PART 60-742 - PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS/CHARGES OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON DISABILITY FILED AGAINST EMPLOYERS HOLDING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR SUBCONTRACTS

##### § 60-742.1 Purpose and application.

The purpose of this part is to implement procedures for processing and resolving complaints/charges of employment discrimination filed against employers holding government contracts or subcontracts, where the complaints/charges fall within the jurisdiction of both section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (hereinafter “Section 503”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (hereinafter “ADA”). The promulgation of this part is required pursuant to section 107(b) of the ADA. Nothing in this part should be deemed to affect the Department of Labor's (hereinafter “DOL”) Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs' (hereinafter “OFCCP”) conduct of compliance reviews of government contractors and subcontractors under section 503. Nothing in this part is intended to create rights in any person.

##### § 60-742.2 Exchange of information.

(a) EEOC and OFCCP shall share any information relating to the employment policies and practices of employers holding government contracts or subcontracts that may assist each office in carrying out its responsibilities. Such information shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, affirmative action programs, annual employment reports, complaints, charges, investigative files, and compliance review reports and files.

(b) All requests by third parties for disclosure of the information described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be coordinated with the agency which initially compiled or collected the information.

(c) Paragraph (b) of this section is not applicable to requests for data in EEOC files made by any state or local agency designated as a “FEP agency” with which EEOC has a charge resolution contract and a work-sharing agreement containing the confidentiality requirements of sections 706(b) and 709(e) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e). However, such an agency shall not disclose any of the information, initially compiled by OFCCP, to the public without express written approval by the Director of OFCCP.

##### § 60-742.3 Confidentiality.

When the Department of Labor receives information obtained by EEOC, the Department of Labor shall observe the confidentiality requirements of sections 706(b) and 709(e) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as incorporated by section 107(a) of the ADA, as would EEOC, except in cases where DOL receives the same information from a source independent of EEOC. Questions concerning confidentiality shall be directed to the Associate Legal Counsel for Legal Services, Office of Legal Counsel of EEOC.

##### § 60-742.4 Standards for investigations, hearings, determinations and other proceedings.

In any OFCCP investigation, hearing, determination or other proceeding involving a complaint/charge that is dual filed under both section 503 and the ADA, OFCCP will utilize legal standards consistent with those applied under the ADA in determining whether an employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice. EEOC and OFCCP will coordinate the arrangement of any necessary training regarding the substantive or procedural provisions of the ADA, and of EEOC's implementing regulations (29 CFR part 1630 and 29 CFR part 1601).

##### § 60-742.5 Processing of complaints filed with OFCCP.

(a) Complaints of employment discrimination filed with OFCCP will be considered charges, simultaneously dual filed, under the ADA whenever the complaints also fall within the jurisdiction of the ADA. OFCCP will act as EEOC's agent for the sole purposes of receiving, investigating and processing the ADA charge component of a section 503 complaint dual filed under the ADA, except as otherwise set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) Within ten days of receipt of a complaint of employment discrimination under section 503 (charge under the ADA), OFCCP shall notify the contractor/respondent that it has received a complaint of employment discrimination under section 503 (charge under the ADA). This notification shall state the date, place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice.

(c) Pursuant to work-sharing agreements between EEOC and state and local agencies designated as FEP agencies, the deferral period for section 503 complaints/ADA charges dual filed with OFCCP will be waived.

(d) OFCCP shall transfer promptly to EEOC a complaint of employment discrimination over which it does not have jurisdiction but over which EEOC may have jurisdiction. At the same time, OFCCP shall notify the complainant and the contractor/respondent of the transfer, the reason for the transfer, the location of the EEOC office to which the complaint was transferred and that the date OFCCP received the complaint will be deemed the date it was received by EEOC.

(e) OFCCP shall investigate and process as set forth in this section all section 503 complaints/ADA charges dual filed with OFCCP, except as specifically provided in this paragraph. Section 503 complaints/ADA charges raising Priority List issues, those which also include allegations of discrimination of an individual nature on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and those which also include an allegation of discrimination on the basis of age will be referred in their entirety by OFCCP to EEOC for investigation, processing and final resolution, provided that such complaints/charges do not include allegations of violation of affirmative action requirements under section 503. In such a situation, OFCCP will bifurcate the complaints/charges and refer to EEOC the Priority List issues or allegations of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or age. OFCCP shall normally retain, investigate, process and resolve all allegations of discrimination, over which it has jurisdiction, of a systemic or class nature on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin that it receives. However, in appropriate cases the EEOC may request that it be referred such allegations so as to avoid duplication of effort and assure effective law enforcement.

(1)If the OFCCP investigation of the section 503 complaint/ADA charge results in a finding of no violation under section 503 (no cause under the ADA), OFCCP will issue a determination of no violation/no cause under both section 503 and the ADA, and issue a right-to-sue letter under the ADA, closing the complaint/charge.

(2)&#x2014;(i)If the OFCCP investigation of the section 503 complaint/ADA charge results in a finding of violation under section 503 (cause under the ADA), OFCCP will issue a finding of violation/cause under both section 503 and ADA. OFCCP shall attempt conciliation to obtain appropriate full relief for the complainant (charging party), consistent with EEOC's standards for remedies. If conciliation is successful and the contractor/respondent agrees to provide full relief, the section 503 complaint/ADA charge will be closed and the conciliation agreement will state that the complainant (charging party) agrees to waive the right to pursue the subject issues further under section 503 and/or the ADA.

(ii)All section 503 complaints/ADA charges not successfully conciliated will be considered for OFCCP administrative litigation under section 503, consistent with OFCCP's usual procedures. (See 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;741, subpart B.) If OFCCP pursues administrative litigation under section 503, OFCCP will close the complaint/charge at the conclusion of the litigation process (including the imposition of appropriate sanctions), unless the complaint/charge is dismissed on procedural grounds or because of a lack of jurisdiction, or the contractor/respondent fails to comply with an order to provide make whole relief. In these three cases, OFCCP will refer the matter to EEOC for any action it deems appropriate. If EEOC declines to pursue further action, it will issue a notice of right-to-sue. If OFCCP does not pursue administrative enforcement, it will close the section 503 component of the complaint/charge and refer the ADA charge component to EEOC for litigation review under the ADA. If EEOC declines to litigate, EEOC will close the ADA charge and issue a notice of right-to-sue.

(f) Consistent with the ADA procedures set forth at 29 CFR 1601.28, OFCCP shall promptly issue upon request a notice of right-to-sue after 180 days from the date the complaint/charge was filed. Issuance of a notice of right-to-sue shall terminate further OFCCP processing of any complaint/charge unless it is determined at that time or at a later time that it would effectuate the purposes of section 503 and/or the ADA to further process the complaint/charge.

(g) If an individual who has already filed a section 503 complaint with OFCCP subsequently attempts to file or files an ADA charge with EEOC covering the same facts and issues, EEOC will decline to accept the charge (or, alternatively, dismiss a charge that has been filed) on the grounds that such charge has already been filed under the ADA, simultaneous with the filing of the earlier section 503 complaint, and will be processed by OFCCP in accordance with the provisions of this section.

##### § 60-742.6 Processing of charges filed with EEOC.

(a)ADA cause charges that also fall within the jurisdiction of section 503 and that the Commission has declined to litigate will be referred to OFCCP for review of the file and any administrative action deemed appropriate under section 503. Such charges will be considered to be complaints, simultaneously dual filed under section 503, solely for the purposes of OFCCP review and administrative action described in this paragraph.

(b)ADA charges filed with EEOC, in which both allegations of discrimination under the ADA and violation of affirmative action requirements under section 503 are made, will be referred in their entirety to OFCCP for processing and resolution under section 503 and the ADA, unless the charges also include allegations of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or age, or include allegations involving Priority List issues, or the charges are otherwise deemed of particular importance to EEOC's enforcement of the ADA. In such situations, EEOC will bifurcate the charges and retain the ADA component of the charges (and when applicable, the allegations pertaining to discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or age), referring the section 503 affirmative action component of the charges to OFCCP for processing and resolution under section 503. ADA charges which raise both discrimination issues under the ADA and section 503 affirmative action issues will be considered complaints, simultaneously dual filed under section 503, solely for the purposes of referral to OFCCP for processing, as described in this paragraph.

(c) EEOC shall transfer promptly to OFCCP a charge of disability-related employment discrimination over which it does not have jurisdiction, but over which OFCCP may have jurisdiction. At the same time, EEOC shall notify the charging party and the contractor/respondent of the transfer, the reason for the transfer, the location of the OFCCP office to which the charge was transferred and that the date EEOC received the charge will be deemed the date it was received by OFCCP.

(d) Except as otherwise stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, individuals alleging violations of laws enforced by DOL and over which EEOC has no jurisdiction will be referred to DOL to file a complaint.

(e) If an individual who has already filed an ADA charge with EEOC subsequently attempts to file or files a section 503 complaint with OFCCP covering the same facts and issues, OFCCP will accept the complaint, but will adopt as a disposition of the complaint EEOC's resolution of the ADA charge (including EEOC's termination of proceedings upon its issuance of a notice of right-to-sue).

##### § 60-742.7 Review of this part.

This part shall be reviewed by the Chairman of the EEOC and the Director of OFCCP periodically, and as appropriate, to determine whether changes to the part are necessary or desirable, and whether the part should remain in effect.

### Chapter 61 - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training Service, Department of Labor

#### PART 61-300 - ANNUAL REPORT FROM FEDERAL CONTRACTORS

##### § 61-300.1 What is the purpose and scope of this part?

(a) This part 61&#x2013;300 implements 38 U.S.C. 4212(d). Each contractor or subcontractor who enters into a contract or subcontract in the amount of $100,000 or more with any department or agency of the United States for the procurement of personal property and non-personal services (including construction), and who is subject to 38 U.S.C. 4212(a), must report annually to the Secretary of Labor information on the number of employees in its workforce who belong to the categories of veterans protected under the Act, and the number of those employees who were hired during the period covered by the report. Each contractor or subcontractor must provide the required information on veterans' employment by filing the Federal Contractor Veterans' Employment Report VETS&#x2013;4212 (VETS&#x2013;4212 Report), in accordance with the requirements of § 61&#x2013;300.11.

(b) Notwithstanding the regulations in this part, the regulations at 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;300, administered by OFCCP continue to apply to contractors' and subcontractors' affirmative action obligations regarding protected veterans.

(c) Reporting requirements of this part regarding protected veterans will be deemed waived in those instances in which the Director of OFCCP has granted a waiver under 41 CFR 60&#x2013;300.4(b)(1), or has concurred in the granting of a waiver under 41 CFR 60&#x2013;300.4(b)(3), from compliance with all the terms of the equal opportunity clause for those establishments not involved in Government contract work. Where OFCCP grants only a partial waiver, compliance with these reporting requirements regarding protected veterans will be required.

(d) 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;300, subpart C and Appendix B to part 60&#x2013;300 provide guidance concerning the affirmative action obligations of Federal contractors toward applicants for employment who are protected veterans.

##### § 61-300.2 What definitions apply to this part?

(a) For the purposes of this part, the definitions for the terms “contract,” “contractor”, “Government contract,” “subcontract,” and “subcontractor” are the same as those set forth in 41 CFR part 60&#x2013;300.

(b) For purposes of this part:

(1)means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.

(2)means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985 (61 FR 1209, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 159).

(3)means:

(i) A veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or

(ii) A person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.

(4)means filing the VETS&#x2013;4212 Report via the VETS web-based filing system. E-filing also includes transmitting or delivering the VETS&#x2013;4212 Report as an electronic data file. Instructions for electronically filing the VETS&#x2013;4212 Report are found on VETS' Web site at:

(5)means any individual on the payroll of an employer who is an employee for purposes of the employer's withholding of Social Security taxes except insurance sales agents who are considered to be employees for such purposes solely because of the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 3121 (d)(3)(B) (the Internal Revenue Code). Leased employees are included in this definition. Leased employee means a permanent employee provided by an employment agency for a fee to an outside company for which the employment agency handles all personnel tasks including payroll, staffing, benefit payments and compliance reporting. The employment agency shall, therefore, include leased employees in its VETS&#x2013;4212 Report. The term employee shall not include persons who are hired on a casual basis for a specified time, or for the duration of a specified job (for example, persons at a construction site whose employment relationship is expected to terminate with the end of the employee's work at the site); persons temporarily employed in any industry other than construction, such as temporary office workers, mariners, stevedores, lumber yard workers, etc., who are hired through a hiring hall or other referral arrangement, through an employee contractor or agent, or by some individual hiring arrangement, or persons (except leased employees) on the payroll of an employment agency who are referred by such agency for work to be performed on the premises of another employer under that employer's direction and control.

(6)(this definition is identical toas defined by the instructions for completing Employer Information Report EEO&#x2013;1, Standard Form 100 (EEO&#x2013;1 Report)) means an economic unit which produces goods or services, such as a factory, office, store, or mine. In most instances the establishment is at a single physical location and is engaged in one, or predominantly one, type of economic activity. Units at different locations, even though engaged in the same kind of business operation, should be reported as separate establishments. For locations involving construction, transportation, communications, electric, gas, and sanitary services, oil and gas fields, and similar types of physically dispersed industrial activities, however, it is not necessary to list separately each individual site, project, field, line, etc., unless it is treated by the contractor as a separate legal entity. For these physically dispersed activities, list as establishments only those relatively permanent main or branch offices, terminals, stations, etc., which are either:

(i) Directly responsible for supervising such dispersed activities; or

(ii) The base from which personnel and equipment operate to carry out these activities. (Where these dispersed activities cross State lines, at least one such establishment should be listed for each State involved).

(7)means any of the following: Officials and managers (Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers and First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers), professionals, technicians, sales workers, administrative support workers, craft workers, operatives, laborers and helpers, and service workers, as required by the EEO&#x2013;1 Report, as follows:

Residing in the highest levels of organizations, these executives plan, direct, or coordinate activities with the support of subordinate executives and staff managers. They include, in larger organizations, those individuals within two reporting levels of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), whose responsibilities require frequent interaction with the CEO. Examples of these kinds of managers are: Chief executive officers, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, line of business heads, presidents or executive vice presidents of functional areas or operating groups, chief information officers, chief human resources officers, chief marketing officers, chief legal officers, management directors and managing partners.

(B)means individuals who serve as managers, other than those who serve as Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers, including those who oversee and direct the delivery of products, services or functions at group, regional or divisional levels of organizations. These managers receive directions from Executive/Senior Level management and typically lead major business units. They implement policies, programs and directives of Executive/Senior Level management through subordinate managers and within the parameters set by Executives/Senior Level management. Examples of these kinds of managers are: Vice presidents and directors; group, regional or divisional controllers; treasurers; and human resources, information systems, marketing, and operations managers. The First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers subcategory also includes those who report directly to middle managers. These individuals serve at functional, line of business segment or branch levels and are responsible for directing and executing the day-to-day operational objectives of enterprises/organizations, conveying the directions of higher level officials and managers to subordinate personnel and, in some instances, directly supervising the activities of exempt and non-exempt personnel. Examples of these kinds of managers are: First-line managers; team managers; unit managers; operations and production managers; branch managers; administrative services managers; purchasing and transportation managers; storage and distribution managers; call center or customer service managers; technical support managers; and brand or product managers.

(vi)means individuals in positions that include higher skilled occupations in construction (building trades craft workers and their formal apprentices) and natural resource extraction workers. Examples of these types of positions include: boilermakers; brick and stone masons; carpenters; electricians; painters (both construction and maintenance); glaziers; pipe layers, plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters; plasterers; roofers; elevator installers; earth drillers; derrick operators; oil and gas rotary drill operators; and blasters and explosive workers. This category also includes occupations related to the installation, maintenance and part replacement of equipment, machines and tools, such as: automotive mechanics; aircraft mechanics; and electric and electronic equipment repairers. This category also includes some production occupations that are distinguished by the high degree of skill and precision required to perform them, based on clearly defined task specifications, such as: millwrights; etchers and engravers; tool and die makers; and pattern makers.

(vii)means individuals in intermediate skilled occupations and includes workers who operate machines or factory-related processing equipment. Most of these occupations do not usually require more than several months of training. Examples include: textile machine workers; laundry and dry cleaning workers; photographic process workers; weaving machine operators; electrical and electronic equipment assemblers; semiconductor processors; testers, graders and sorters; bakers; and butchers and other meat, poultry and fish processing workers. This category also includes occupations of generally intermediate skill levels that are concerned with operating and controlling equipment to facilitate the movement of people or materials, such as: bridge and lock tenders; truck, bus or taxi drivers; industrial truck and tractor (forklift) operators; parking lot attendants; sailors; conveyor operators; and hand packers and packagers.

(viii)means individuals with more limited skills who require only brief training to perform tasks that require little or no independent judgment. Examples include: production and construction worker helpers; vehicle and equipment cleaners; laborers; freight, stock and material movers; service station attendants; construction laborers; refuse and recyclable materials collectors; septic tank servicers; and sewer pipe cleaners.

(ix)means individuals in positions that include food service, cleaning service, personal service, and protective service activities.

(10)means a veteran who is protected under the non-discrimination and affirmative action provisions of the Act; specifically, a veteran who may be classified as a “disabled veteran,” “recently separated veteran,” “active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran,” or an “Armed Forces service medal veteran,” as defined in this section.

(11)means a veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service.

(12)means each of the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Wake Island, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands.

(13)means the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training Service, U.S. Department of Labor.

This includes those common administrative services provided by a Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU). It does not include such common building features as cafeterias, blind stands, loading platforms, auditoriums, incinerators, or similar facilities. Excluded are interagency fleet management centers established pursuant to Public Law 766, 83d Congress, and covered by part 101&#x2013;39 of this chapter.

(b)means any Federal agency assigned space in a building or complex for which GSA has oversight of, or responsibility for the functions of operation and maintenance in addition to space assignment.

(c)means an organized mechanism for providing administrative services for agencies in multi-tenant federally occupied buildings.

####### § 101-5.103 Policy.

To the extent practicable, GSA will provide or arrange for the provision of centralized services whenever such services insure increased efficiency and economy to the Government without hampering program activities or essential internal administration of the agencies to be served.

####### § 101-5.104 Economic feasibility of centralized services.

####### § 101-5.104-1 General.

GSA is currently providing various centralized services to Federal agencies in such fields as office and storage space, supplies and materials, communications, records management, transportation services, and printing and reprographics. Other centralized CASU's may be providing supporting services or activities such as health units, use of training devices and facilities, pistol ranges, and central facilities for receipt and dispatch of mail. Consolidation and sharing is frequently feasible with resulting economies in personnel, equipment, and space. Opportunities to effect economies through planned consolidation of such services occur particularly during the design stage of the construction of new Federal buildings, or the renovations to existing buildings. Opportunities may also occur as a result of needs assessments jointly conducted by local agencies.

####### § 101-5.104-2 Basis for determining economic feasibility.

(a) Whenever possible, determination of the economic feasibility of a proposed centralized service shall be based upon standard data on the relationship of the size of the Federal building, the number of occupants, location, and other factors pertinent to the type of centralized service being considered.

(b) In the absence of standard data on which a determination of economic feasibility can be based, or where such data must be supplemented by additional factual information, a formal feasibility study may be made by GSA or a CASU workgroup, in coordination with local agencies to be involved, prior to a final determination to proceed with the furnishing of a centralized service. Generally, a formal feasibility study will be made only if provision of the proposed centralized service would involve the pooling of staff, equipment, and space which occupying agencies otherwise would be required to use in providing the service for themselves. Examples of centralized services which may require formal studies include printing and duplicating plants and similar facilities.

(c) On the basis of experience under the centralized services program, GSA will develop criteria as to cost comparisons, production needs, building population, number of agencies involved, and other appropriate factors for consideration in determining the practicability of establishing various types of centralized services.

####### § 101-5.104-3 Data requirements for feasibility studies.

(a) The data requirements for feasibility studies may vary from program to program, but shall be standard within any single program. Such data shall disclose the costs resulting from provisions of the service on a centralized basis as compared to the same service provided separately by each occupying agency, including the costs of personnel assigned to provide the service, comparative space needs, equipment use, and any other pertinent factors.

(b) Wherever feasible and appropriate, data will be secured directly from the prospective occupying agencies, subject to necessary verification procedures. Suitable standard formats and necessary instructions for submission of data will be prescribed in applicable subchapters of chapter 101.

(c) Agencies required to submit data for a feasibility study will be furnished with copies of the prescribed reporting forms and such assistance as may be needed to assure their accurate and timely completion.

####### § 101-5.104-4 Scheduling feasibility studies.

The schedule of feasibility studies will be coordinated by GSA with its construction, space management, and buildings management programs. Before initiating the study, the Administrator of General Services, or his authorized designee, will give at least 30 days' notice to the head of each agency that would be served by the proposed centralized facility. Such notice will contain an indication of the cost elements involved and the general procedures to be followed in the study.

####### § 101-5.104-5 Designating agency representatives.

The head of each agency receiving a GSA notice regarding a scheduled feasibility study will be requested to designate one or more officials at the location where the study will be made who may consult with authorized GSA representatives. Such information and assistance as is required or pertinent for an adequate review of the feasibility of the proposed centralized service shall be made available to GSA through the designated agency representatives.

####### § 101-5.104-6 Conduct of feasibility studies.

An initial meeting of the representatives of prospective occupying agencies will be held to discuss the objectives and detailed procedures to be followed in the conduct of each feasibility study. Arrangements will be made at this meeting for securing all necessary data in accordance with § 101&#x2013;5.104&#x2013;3.

####### § 101-5.104-7 Administrator's determination.

(a) The Administrator of General Services will determine, on the basis of the feasibility study, whether provision of a centralized service meets the criteria for increased economy, efficiency, and service, with due regard to the program and internal administrative requirements of the agencies to be served. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the head of each agency affected will be advised of the Administrator's determination and of the reasons therefor. Each determination to provide a centralized service shall include a formal report containing an explanation of the advantages to be gained, a comparison of estimated annual costs between the proposed centralized operation and separate agency operations, and a statement of the date the centralized facility will be fully operational.

(b) While a formal appeals procedure is not prescribed, any agency desiring to explain its inability to participate in the use of a centralized service may do so through a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to the Administrator of General Services.

####### § 101-5.105 Operation of the centralized facility.

(a) GSA will continually appraise the operation of centralized facilities to insure their continued justification in terms of economy and efficiency. Centralized services provided pursuant to the regulation may be discontinued or curtailed if no actual savings or operating improvements are realized after a minimum operating period of one year. Occupying agencies will be consulted regarding the timing of curtailment or discontinuance of any centralized services and the heads of such agencies notified at least 120 days in advance of each action.

(b) Where mutual agreement is reached, an agency other than GSA may be designated by the Administrator of General Services to administer the centralized service.

(c) Arrangements with regard to financing will conform to the special requirements of each type of centralized service and to existing law. Normally, reimbursement will be made for the use of established services except where the cost is nominal or where reimbursement may not be practicable.

####### § 101-5.106 Agency committees.

(a)An occupying agency committee will be established by GSA if one does not exist, to assist the occupying agency, or such other agency as may be responsible, in the cooperative use of the centralized services, as defined in 101&#x2013;5.102(a), provided in a Federal building. Generally, such a committee will be established when the problems of administration and coordination necessitate a formal method of consultation and discussion among occupying agencies.

(b)Each occupying agency of a Federal building is entitled to membership on an agency committee. The chairperson of each such committee shall be a GSA employee designated by the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator, except when another agency had been designated to administer the centralized service. In this instance, the chairperson shall be an employee of such other agency as designated by competent authority within that agency.

(c)Agency committees shall be advisory in nature and shall be concerned with the effectiveness of centralized services in the building. Recommendations of an agency committee will be forwarded by the chairman to the appropriate GSA officials for consideration and decision.

(d)A r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; of the minutes of each meeting of an agency committee shall be furnished to each member of the committee and to the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator.

###### Subpart 101-5.2 [Reserved]

###### Subpart 101-5.3 - Federal Employee Health Services

####### § 101-5.300 Scope of subpart.

This subpart 101&#x2013;5.3 states the objective, guiding principles, criteria, and general procedures in connection with the establishment and operation of Federal employee health services in buildings managed by GSA.

####### § 101-5.301 Applicability.

This subpart 101&#x2013;5.3 is applicable to all Federal agencies which occupy space in or are prospective occupying agencies of a building or group of adjoining buildings managed by GSA.

####### § 101-5.302 Objective.

It is the objective of GSA to provide or arrange for appropriate health service programs in all Government-owned and leased buildings, or groups of adjoining buildings, which it manages where the building population warrants, where other Federal medical facilities are not available, and, where the number of the occupying agencies indicating a willingness to participate in such a program on a reimbursable basis makes it financially feasible.

####### § 101-5.303 Guiding principles.

The following principles will control the scope of the health services to be provided in keeping with the objective:

(a) Employees who work in groups of 300 or more, counting employees of all departments or agencies who are scheduled to be on duty at one time in the same building or group of buildings in the same locality will constitute the minimum number of employees required to warrant the establishment of a health service of a scope specified in § 101&#x2013;5.304.

(b) As an exception to paragraph (a) of this section, health services of the scope specified in § 101&#x2013;5.304 may be provided for employees who work in groups of less than 300 where the employing department or agency determines that working conditions involving unusual health risks warrant such provision.

(c) Treatment and medical care in performance-of-duty cases will be provided to employees as set forth in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 751).

(d) Reimbursable costs for providing health services will be based on an operating budget which is a summary of all costs required to operate the health service. The reimbursement cost is prorated to participating agencies by means of a per capital formula computed by dividing the operating budget of the health service by the total number of employees sponsored for service. The size of the Federal population served, the compensation of the employees of the health unit, and other factors of medical economics prevalent in the area are factors which affect the local reimbursement cost. Further, in appropriate cases where more than one health unit is servicing employees housed in the same general locality, costs may be equalized by combining the operating budgets of all such units and dividing the total of the operating budgets by the number of employees sponsored. Special industrial conditions or other abnormal health or accident risk environments may increase the per capita cost.

####### § 101-5.304 Type of occupational health services.

The type of occupational health services made available to occupying agencies will be as follows:

(a) Emergency diagnosis and first treatment of injury or illness that become necessary during working hours and that are within the competence of the professional staff and facilities of the health service unit, whether or not such injury was sustained by the employee while in the performance of duty or whether or not such illness was caused by his employment. In cases where the necessary first treatment is outside the competence of the health service staff and facilities, conveyance of the employee to a nearby physician or suitable community medical facility may be provided at Government expense at the request of, or on behalf of, the employee.

(b) Preemployment examinations of persons selected for appointment.

(c) Such inservice examinations of employees as the participating agency determines to be necessary, such as voluntary employee health maintenance examinations which agencies may request for selected employees. Such examinations may be offered on a limited formula plan to all participating agencies when the resources of the health service staff and facilities will permit. Alternatively, when agencies are required to limit the cost of an occupational health services program, the provision of inservice examinations may be provided to selected employees of individual agencies and reimbursed on an individual basis.

(d) Administration, in the discretion of the responsible health service unit physician, of treatments and medications

(1) Furnished by the employee and prescribed in writing by his personal physician as reasonably necessary to maintain the employee at work, and

(2) Prescribed by a physician providing medical care in performance-of-duty injury or illness cases under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.

(e) Preventive services within the competence of the professional staff

(1) To appraise and report work environment health hazards as an aid in preventing and controlling health risks;

(2) To provide health education to encourage employees to maintain personal health; and

(3) To provide specific disease screening examinations and immunizations.

(f) In addition, employees may be referred, upon their request, to private physicians, dentists, and other community health resources.

####### § 101-5.305 Agency participation.

At the time the space requirements for a building or a group of adjoining buildings are developed by GSA, the prospective occupying agencies will be canvassed by GSA to determine if they wish to participate in the occupational health services program. Each agency desiring to participate in the program will be requested to furnish GSA with a written commitment, signed by an authorized official, that it is prepared to reimburse GSA, or such other agency as is designated pursuant to § 101&#x2013;5.105(b), on a yearly per capita basis for each of its employees housed in the building or buildings covered by the program.

####### § 101-5.306 Economic feasibility.

(a) The studies by GSA which lead to the development of space requirements and the determinations made as the result thereof will constitute the feasibility studies and the Administrator's determination contemplated by § 101&#x2013;5.104.

(b) Each determination to provide health services will be governed by the principles stated in § 101&#x2013;5.303 and will be in consonance with the general standards and guidelines furnished Federal agencies by the Public Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

####### § 101-5.307 Public Health Service.

(a) The only authorized contact point for assistance of and consultation with the Public Health Service is the Federal Employee Health Programs, Division of Hospitals, Public Health Service, Washington, DC 20201. Other Federal agencies may be designated by the GSA Regional Administrator, pursuant to § 101&#x2013;5.105(b) to operate occupational health services. Designated agencies should contact the Public Health Service directly on all matters dealing with the establishment and operation of these services.

(b) Public Health Service should be consulted by the designated agency on such matters as types, amounts, and approximate cost of necessary equipment; the scope of the services to be provided if it is affected by the amount of space and number of building occupants; types and amounts of supplies, materials, medicines, etc., which should be stocked; and the approximate cost of personnel staffing in cases where this method of operation is chosen, etc. PHS should also be asked to develop and monitor standards under which each health unit would be operated.

###### Subparts 101-5.4 - 101-5.48 [Reserved]

###### Subpart 101-5.49 - Forms, Reports, and Instructions

####### § 101-5.4900 Scope of subpart.

This subpart contains forms, reports, and related instructions used in connection with the regulations on centralized services in Federal buildings prescribed in this part 101&#x2013;5.

###### § 101-5.000 Scope of part.

This part prescribes the methods by which the General Services Administration provides for establishment of centralized services in Federal buildings or complexes occupied by a number of executive agencies.

##### PART 101-6 - MISCELLANEOUS REGULATIONS

###### Subpart 101-6.1 [Reserved]

###### Subpart 101-6.2 - Nondiscrimination in Programs Receiving Federal Financial Assistance

####### § 101-6.201 Scope of subpart.

This subpart provides the regulations of the General Services Administration (GSA) under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d&#x2014;2000d&#x2013;7) concerning nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs in connection with which Federal financial assistance is extended under laws administered in whole or in part by GSA.

####### § 101-6.202 Purpose.

The purpose of this subpart is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from GSA.

####### § 101-6.203 Application of subpart.

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered in whole or in part by GSA, including the laws listed in § 101&#x2013;6.217. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to any such program after the effective date of this subpart pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This subpart does not apply to (1) Any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended to any such program before the effective date of this subpart, except to the extent otherwise provided by contract, (3) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 101&#x2013;6.204&#x2013;2(d). The fact that a statute which authorizes GSA to extend Federal financial assistance to a program or activity is not listed in § 101&#x2013;6.217 shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the

(b) The regulations issued by the following Departments pursuant to title VI of the Act shall be applicable to Federal financial assistance of the kind indicated, and those Departments shall respectively be responsible for determining and enforcing compliance therewith:

(1) Department of Health, Education, and Welfare&#x2014;donation or transfer of surplus property for purposes of education or public health (§ 101&#x2013;6.217 (a)(2) and (b)).

(2) Department of Defense&#x2014;donation of surplus personal property for purposes of civil defense (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(a)(2)).

(3) Department of Transportation&#x2014;donation of property for public airport purposes (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(c)). GSA will, however, be responsible for obtaining such assurances as may be required in applications and in instruments effecting the transfer of property.

(4) Department of the Interior&#x2014;disposal of surplus real property, including improvements, for use as a public park, public recreational area, or historic monument (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(d) (1) and (2)). GSA will, however, be responsible for obtaining such assurances as may be required in applications and in instruments effecting the transfer of property for use as a historic monument.

(5) Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x2014;disposal of surplus real property for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to be occupied by families or individuals of low or moderate income (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(q)).

(c) Each Department named in paragraph (b) of this section shall keep GSA advised of all compliance and enforcement actions, including sanctions imposed or removed, taken by it with respect to the types of Federal financial assistance specified in paragraph (b) of this section to which the regulations of such Department apply.

####### § 101-6.204 Discrimination prohibited.

####### § 101-6.204-1 General.

No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies.

####### § 101-6.204-2 Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

(a)(1) In connection with any program to which this subpart applies, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:

(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;

(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this § 101&#x2013;6.204&#x2013;2).

(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this subpart.

(4) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the ground of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.

(b) As used in this § 101&#x2013;6.204&#x2013;2 the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.

(c) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this § 101&#x2013;6.204&#x2013;2 does not limit the generality of the pro hibition in § 101&#x2013;6.204&#x2013;1.

(d)(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this subpart applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including, but not limited to, recruitment or recruitment advertising; employment; layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion, or transfer; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; selection for training, including apprenticeship; and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or the corresponding provisions of any Executive order which supersedes it.

(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this subpart, to the extent necessary to insure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.

####### § 101-6.204-3 Special benefits.

An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion from benefits limited by Federal law to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin different from his.

####### § 101-6.205 Assurances required.

####### § 101-6.205-1 General.

(a) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this subpart 101&#x2013;6.2 applies, except an application to which § 101&#x2013;6.205&#x2013;2 applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart 101&#x2013;6.2. In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property, the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible GSA official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.

(b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which is acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by GSA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible GSA official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Administrator may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumberance remains effective.

(c) The assurance required in the case of a transfer of personal property shall be inserted in the instrument effecting the transfer of the property.

(d) In the case of Federal financial assistance not involving a transfer of property, the assurance required shall be inserted in the agreement executed between the United States and the recipient covering the extension of Federal financial assistance.

####### § 101-6.205-2 Continuing Federal financial assistance.

Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this subpart applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (a) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, and (b) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible GSA official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart.

####### § 101-6.205-3 Elementary and secondary schools.

The requirements of §§ 101&#x2013;6.205&#x2013;1 and 101&#x2013;6.205&#x2013;2 with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (a) Is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (b) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this subpart within the earliest practicable time, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan. In any case of continuing Federal financial assistance such responsible official may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this subpart. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.

####### § 101-6.205-4 Applicability of assurances.

(a) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education, the assurance required by this § 101&#x2013;6.205 shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.

(b) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.

(c) Where an installation or facility (for example, a public airport, or park or recreation area) is comprised of real property for which application is made, and, in addition, other real property of the applicant, the assurance required under this § 101&#x2013;6.205 shall be applicable to the entire installation or facility.

####### § 101-6.206 Illustrative applications.

The following examples will illustrate the application of the foregoing provisions of this subpart to certain programs for which Federal financial assistance is extended by GSA (in all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin, prohibited by title VI of the Act and this subpart):

(a) In the programs involving the transfer of surplus property for airport, park or recreation, historic monument, wildlife conservation, or street widening purposes (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(c), (d), (e), and (h)), the public generally is entitled to the use of the facility and to receive the services provided by the facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith, without segregation or any other discriminatory practices.

(b) In the program involving the loan of machine tools to nonprofit institutions or training schools (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(o)), discrimination by the recipient in the admission of students or trainees or in the treatment of its students or trainees in any aspect of the educational process is prohibited. In the case of an institution of higher education, the prohibition applies to the entire institution. In the case of elementary or secondary schools, the prohibition applies to all elementary and secondary schools of the recipient school district, consistent with § 101&#x2013;6.205&#x2013;3. In this and other illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational, or other facilities of the recipient.

(c) In the programs involving the donation of personal property to public bodies or the American National Red Cross (§ 101&#x2013;6.217 (f) and (j)), discrimination in the selection or treatment of individuals to receive or receiving the benefits or services of the program is prohibited.

(d) In the program involving the donation of personal property to eleemosynary institutions (§ 101&#x2013;6.217()), the assurance will apply to applicants for admission, patients, interns, residents, student nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians, dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the institution, and will apply to the entire institution and to facilities operated in connection therewith.

(e) In the programs involving the allotment of space by GSA to Federal Credit Unions, without charge for rent or services, and the provision of free space and utilities for vending stands operated by blind persons (§ 101&#x2013;6.217 (i) and (k)), discrimination by segregation or otherwise in providing benefits or services is prohibited.

(f) In the program involving grants to State and local agencies and to nonprofit organizations and institutions for the collecting, describing, preserving, and compiling and publishing of documentary sources significant to the history of the United States (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(n)), discrimination by the recipient in the selection of students or other participants in the program, and, with respect to educational institutions, in the admission or treatment of students, is prohibited.

(g) In the program involving the transfer of surplus real property for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to families or individuals of low or moderate income (§ 101&#x2013;6.217(q)), discrimination in the selection and assignment of tenants is prohibited.

(h) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this subpart forbids it to accomplish directly.

(i) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 101&#x2013;6.209&#x2013;4 to provide information as to the availability of the program or activity and the rights of beneficiaries under this subpart have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for obtaining referrals or making selections which will ensure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.

(j) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups not then being adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more adequate service.

Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (a) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (b) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

####### § 101-6.211-2 Noncompliance with § 101-6.205.

If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 101&#x2013;6.205 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of § 101&#x2013;6.211&#x2013;3.

Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

(a) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible GSA official that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (b) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this section or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 101&#x2013;6.211&#x2013;3, and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

(b) [Reserved]

Both GSA and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

(b) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this subpart 101&#x2013;6.2, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

####### § 101-6.212-5 Consolidated or joint hearings.

Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible GSA official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible GSA official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible GSA official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible GSA official.

####### § 101-6.213-2 Decisions on record or review by the responsible GSA official.

Whenever a record is certified to the responsible GSA official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to § 101&#x2013;6.213&#x2013;1, or whenever the responsible GSA official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible GSA official shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

####### § 101-6.213-5 Approval by Administrator.

####### § 101-6.213-7 Post termination proceedings.

(a) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under § 101&#x2013;6.213&#x2013;6 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this subpart and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this subpart. An elementary or secondary school or school system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 101&#x2013;6.24 shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation meeting the requirements of § 101&#x2013;6.205&#x2013;3 and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with this court order or plan.

(b) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to § 101&#x2013;6.213&#x2013;6 may at any time request the responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the responsible GSA official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.

(c) If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request, in writing, for a hearing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. While proceedings under this section are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under § 101&#x2013;6.213&#x2013;6 shall remain in effect.

####### § 101-8.706 Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.

####### § 101-8.706-1 Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.

A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor if:

(a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

(b) The other characteristic must be measured or approximated for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

(c) The other characteristic can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

(d) The other characteristic is impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.

####### § 101-8.706-2 Reasonable factors other than age.

(a) A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 101&#x2013;8.706&#x2013;1, which is based on something other than age, even though the action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages.

(b) An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial correlation to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.

####### § 101-8.707 Burden of proof.

The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in § 101&#x2013;8.706 is the recipient's.

####### § 101-8.708 Affirmative action by recipient.

Even in the absence of a finding of age discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects resulting in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity.

####### § 101-8.709 Special benefits for children and the elderly.

If a recipient's program or activity provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions is presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program or activity, notwithstanding the provisions of § 101&#x2013;8.705.

####### § 101-8.710 Age distinctions contained in General Services Administration regulation.

Any age distinctions contained in a rule or regulation issued by GSA are presumed to be necessary to the achievement of a statutory objective of the program or activity to which the rule or regulation applies. The GSA regulation 41 CFR 101&#x2013;44.207(a) (3) through (27), describes specific Federal financial assistance which provides assistance to all age groups. However, the Child Care Center Program servicing children through age 14, and “Programs for Older Individuals”, are the only two types of Federal financial assistance where age distinctions are provided.

####### § 101-8.711 General responsibilities.

Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from GSA is responsible for ensuring that its programs or activities comply with the Act and this regulation and must take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A recipient is also responsible for maintaining records, providing information, and affording GSA access to its records to the extent GSA finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation.

####### § 101-8.712 Notice to subrecipients and beneficiaries.

(a) If a primary recipient passes on Federal financial assistance from GSA to subrecipients, the primary recipient provides to subrecipients, written notice of their obligations under the Act and this regulation.

(b) Each recipient makes necessary information about the Act and this regulation available to its beneficiaries to inform them about the protections against discrimination provided by the Act and this regulation.

####### § 101-8.713 Assurance of compliance and recipient assessment of age distinctions.

(a) Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from GSA signs a written assurance as specified by GSA that it intends to comply with the Act and this regulation.

(b) Recipient assessment of age distinctions.

(1) As part of a compliance review under § 101&#x2013;8.715 or complaint investigation under § 101.8.718, GSA may require a recipient employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written self-evaluation of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from GSA to assess the recipient's compliance with the Act.

(2) If an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the GSA regulation, the recipient takes corrective action.

####### § 101-8.714 Information requirements.

Each recipient must:

(a) Keep records in a form and containing information that GSA determines necessary to ensure that the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation.

(b) Provide to GSA upon request, information and reports that GSA determines necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation.

(c) Permit reasonable access by GSA to books, records, accounts, facilities, and other sources of information to the extent GSA finds it necessary to find out whether the recipient is complying with the Act and this regulation. GSA adopts HHS policy regarding the kinds of data and information recipients are expected to keep (45 CFR 90.34). This policy is parallel to compliance information sections in the title VI, title IX, and section 504 implementation regulations. While recognizing the need for enough data to assess recipient compliance, GSA is committed to lessening the data gathering burden on recipients. GSA further recognizes that there is no established body of knowledge or experience to guide the assessment of age discrimination. This regulation, therefore, does not impose specific data requirements upon recipients, rather, it allows GSA to be flexible in deciding what kinds of data should be kept by recipients, based on what kinds of data prove useful as GSA gains experience with the Age Discrimination Act, and age discrimination issues become clearer.

(d) In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 59&#x2013;511), the reporting and record keeping provisions included in this regulation will be submitted, for approval, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). No data collection or record keeping requirement will be imposed on recipients or donees without the required OMB approval number.

####### § 101-8.715 Compliance reviews.

(a) GSA may conduct compliance reviews and use similar procedures to investigate and correct violations of the Act and this regulation. GSA may conduct the reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of the Act and this regulation has occurred.

(b) If a compliance review indicates a violation of the Act or this regulation, GSA attempts to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If compliance cannot be achieved, GSA arranges for enforcement as described in § 101&#x2013;8.720.

####### § 101-8.716 Complaints.

(a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class (defined at § 101&#x2013;8.703(e)) or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with GSA alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or this regulation based on an action occurring after July 1, 1979. A complainant must file a complaint within 80 days from the date the complainant first has knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, GSA may extend this time limit.

(b) GSA considers the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.

(c) GSA attempts to facilitate the filing of complaints if possible, including taking the following measures:

(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement that identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes the action or practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant;

(2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint;

(3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representative) of their right to contact GSA for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.

(d) GSA returns to the complainant any complaint outside the jurisdiction of this regulation, and states the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of the regulation.

####### § 101-8.717 Mediation.

(a) GSA promptly refers to the mediation agency designated by the Secretary, HHS, all sufficient complaints that:

(1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and this regulation, unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; and

(2) Contain the information needed for further processing.

(b) Both the complainant and the recipient must participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgement that an agreement is not possible. Both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

(c) If the complainant and the recipient agree, the mediator will prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator must send a copy of the agreement to GSA. GSA takes no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.

(d) The mediator must protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation. No mediator may testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.

(e) The mediation proceeds for a maximum of 60 calendar days after a complaint is filed with GSA. Mediation ends if:

(1) 60 calendar days elapse from the time the complaint is filed; or

(2) Before the end of the 60 calendar-day period an agreement is reached; or

(3) Before the end of that 60 calendar-day period, the mediator finds that an agreement cannot be reached.

(f) The mediator must return unresolved complaints to GSA.

####### § 101-8.718 Investigation.

(a)GSA investigates complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement. As part of the initial investigation, GSA uses informal factfinding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and the recipient, to establish the fact and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. GSA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency. GSA puts any agreement in writing and has it signed by the parties and an authorized official designated by the Administrator or the Director, Office of Organization and Personnel. The settlement may not affect the operation of any other enforcement efforts of GSA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints that may involve the recipient. The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.

(b)If GSA cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it begins to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, GSA attempts to obtain voluntary compliance. If GSA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it begins enforcement as described in § 101&#x2013;8.720.

####### § 101-8.719 Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation against any person who:

(a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act of this regulation; or

(b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, conciliation, and enforcement process.

####### § 101-8.720 Compliance procedure.

(a) GSA may enforce the Act and these regulations through:

(1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from GSA under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this regulation. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.

(2) Any other means authorized by law including, but not limited to:

(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceeding to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipients created by the Act or this regulation, or

(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that has the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this regulation.

(b) GSA limits any termination to the particular recipient and program or activity or part of such program or activity GSA finds in violation of this regulation. GSA does not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.

(c) GSA takes no action under paragraph (a) until:

(1) The administrator advises the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and this regulation and determines that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, and

(2) 30 calendar days elapse after the Administrator sends a written report of the grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Administrator files a report if any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section .

(d) GSA may also defer granting new Federal financial assistance from GSA to a recipient when a hearing under § 101&#x2013;8.721 is initiated.

(1) New Federal financial assistance from GSA includes all assistance for which GSA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from GSA does not include assistance approved before the beginning of a hearing.

(2) GSA does not begin a deferral until the recipient receives notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 101&#x2013;8.721. GSA does not continue a deferral for more than 60 calendar days unless a hearing begins within that time or the time for beginning the hearing is extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Administrator. GSA does not continue a deferral for more than 30 calendar days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.

(3) GSA limits any deferral to the particular recipient and program or activity or part of such program or activity GSA finds in violation of these regulations. GSA does not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not, and would not, receive Federal financial assistance from GSA.

####### § 101-8.721 Hearings.

(a)Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action; and either fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible GSA official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a data has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act, and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.

(b)Hearings shall be held at GSA in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the Director, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), unless he or she determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of GSA requires that another place be selected.

(c)In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and GSA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

(d)(1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 5&#x2013;8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both GSA and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevent evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the Officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearings. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by this part, may be reimbursed for his travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.

(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advances on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

(e)In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute non-compliance with this regulation with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part, and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the responsible GSA official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 101&#x2013;8.722.

####### § 101-8.722 Decisions and notices.

(a)After a hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Agency designated reviewing authority for final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for GSA may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by GSA official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with his or her reasons therefore. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue a decision including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.

(b)Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.

(c)Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 101&#x2013;8.721(a) the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing examiner for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

(d)Each decision of a hearing examiner or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each findings, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

(e)If the Administrator has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for GSA may request the Administrator to review a decision of the Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Administrator determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Administrator may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. He or she may also review such a decision in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. In the absence of a review under this paragraph, a final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this section shall become the final decision of GSA when the Administrator transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under section 602 of the Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the Reviewing Authority or to request review under this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.

(f)The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this regulation, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this regulation unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible GSA official that it will fully comply with this regulation.

(g)(1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that is will fully comply with this part.

(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible GSA official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible GSA official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he or she shall restore such eligibility.

(3) If the responsible GSA official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible GSA official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

####### § 101-8.723 Remedial action by recipient.

If GSA finds a recipient discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient must take any remedial action that GSA may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over the recipient that discriminated, GSA may require both recipients to take remedial action.

####### § 101-8.724 Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

(a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:

(1) 180 calendar days elapse after the complainant files the complaint and GSA makes no finding with regard to the complaint; or

(2) GSA Issues a finding in favor of the recipient.

(b) If GSA fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, GSA must:

(1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact;

(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring civil action for injunctive relief; and

(3) Inform the complainant:

(i) That the complainant may bring civil action only in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;

(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;

(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant must give 30 calendar days notice by registered mail to the Secretary, HHS, The Administrator, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;

(iv) That the notice must state the alleged violation of the Act, the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the action, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

####### § 101-8.725 Alternate funds disbursal.

If GSA withholds Federal financial assistance from a recipient under this regulation, the Administrator may disburse the assistance to an alternate recipient; any public or nonprofit private organization; or agency or State or political subdivision of the State. The Administrator requires any alternate recipient to demonstrate:

(a) The ability to comply with this regulation; and

(b) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal Statutes authorizing the Federal financial assistance.

#### Subchapter E - Supply and Procurement

##### PART 101-25 - GENERAL

###### Subpart 101-25.1 - General Policies

####### § 101-25.100 Use of Government personal property and nonpersonal services.

Except in emergencies, Government personal property and nonpersonal services shall be used only for those purposes for which they were obtained or contracted for or other officially designated purposes. Emergency conditions are those threatening loss of life and property. As used in this sectionmeans those contractual services, other than personal and professional services (as defined in 40 U.S.C. 472). This includes property and services on interagency loan as well as property leased by agencies. Agency heads shall ensure that the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;25.100 are enforced to restrict the use of Government property/services to officially designated activities.

####### § 101-25.101 Criteria for determining method of supply.

####### § 101-25.101-1 General.

(a) This § 101&#x2013;25.101 prescribes general criteria governing selection of the appropriate methods of supply to be utilized in meeting the planned requirements of the Government. It is directly applicable to executive agencies, and other Federal agencies are requested to observe these criteria in conducting their supply operations.

(b) As used in this § 101&#x2013;25.101, the termmeans a storeroom or other redistribution point where supplies, materials, or equipment representing more than a 30-day supply are maintained primarily for issue directly to consumers within the local area, as distinguished from storage points where supplies and equipment are issued to redistribution points.

####### § 101-25.101-2 Supply through storage and issue.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item can be most advantageously supplied through storage and issue to use points:

(a) The item shall be physically adaptable to storage and issue and of such a character that it is feasible to forecast overall requirements of the use points served with reasonable accuracy;

(b) Rate of use and frequency of ordering at use points shall be sufficient to warrant storage and issue;

(c) The rate of deterioration or obsolescence shall be sufficiently low to avoid unnecessary loss; and

(d) Conditions exist where any of the following factors require supply through storage and issue (except that dangerous commodities of high weight and density, or commodities highly susceptible to damage normally should not be considered for supply through storage and issue unless one or more of such factors are determined to be of overriding importance)&#x2014;

(1) Where price advantage through bulk buying is sufficient to render storage and issue more economical, all costs, both direct and indirect, considered.

(2) Where close inspection or testing is necessary to secure quality, or where repetitive inspection and test of small lots are prohibitive from the standpoint of cost or potential urgency of need.

(3) Where advance purchase and storage are necessitated by long procurement leadtime.

(4) Where an item is of special manufacture or design and is not readily available from commercial sources.

(5) Where an adequate industry distribution system does not exist to assure availability at use point.

(6) Where volume purchases are necessary to secure timely deliveries and advantageous prices.

(7) Where market conditions are such that supply through storage and issue is required to assure adequate supply.

(8) Where stocking of supplies and equipment necessary for implementation of emergency plans is required for an indefinite period.

####### § 101-25.101-3 Supply through consolidated purchase for direct delivery to use points.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item can be most advantageously supplied through consolidated purchase for direct delivery to use points:

(a) The items shall be equipment or supply items of such a character that it is feasible to forecast requirements for delivery to specific use points; and

(b) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires consolidated purchasing of such items for direct delivery to use points&#x2014;

(1) Where greatest price advantage, both direct and indirect costs considered, is obtainable through large definite quantity purchasing.

(2) Where an item is of special manufacture or design and is not readily available from commercial sources.

(3) Where market conditions are such that central procurement is required to assure adequate supply.

(4) Where contracts for production quantities are necessary to secure timely deliveries and advantageous prices.

(5) Where the quantity is large enough to assure lowest transportation costs or, conversely, where transportation costs for small quantity redistribution are so excessive that it is not feasible to store and issue the items.

####### § 101-25.101-4 Supply through indefinite quantity requirement contracts.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item can be most advantageously supplied through the medium of indefinite quantity requirement contracts covering specific periods and providing for delivery to use points as needs arise:

(a) The item shall be such a character that&#x2014;

(1) Handling on a storage and issue basis is not economically sound, under the criteria prescribed in § 101&#x2013;25.101&#x2013;2;

(2) Rate of use and frequency of ordering at use points is estimated to be sufficient to warrant the making of indefinite quantity requirement contracts;

(3) It is either not feasible to forecast definite requirements for delivery to specific use points (as in the case of new items initially being introduced into a supply system), or no advantage accrues doing so; and

(b) Industry distribution facilities are adequate properly to serve the use points involved; and

(c) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires the maintaining of indefinite quantity requirements contracts&#x2014;

(1) Advantage to the Government is greater than would be secured by definite quantity procurements by individual offices or agencies (the determining consideration being one of overall economy to the Government, rather than one of direct comparison of unit prices of individual items obtainable through other methods of supply); or no known procurement economies would be effected but the requirements of offices of agencies can best be served by indefinite quantity requirements contracts.

(2) Acute competitive bidding problems exist because of highly technical matters which can best be met on a centralized contracting basis.

(3) The item is proprietary or so complex in design, function, or operation as to be noncompetitive and procurement can best be performed on a centralized contracting basis.

####### § 101-25.101-5 Supply through local purchase.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item should be supplied through local purchase:

(a) Urgency of need requires local purchase to assure prompt delivery;

(b) The items are perishable or subject to rapid deterioration which will not permit delay incident to shipment from distant points;

(c) The local purchase is within applicable limitation established by the agency head; or

(d) Local purchase will produce the greatest economy to the Government.

####### § 101-25.102 Exchange or sale of personal property for replacement purposes.

Policies and methods governing executive agencies in exercising the authority granted under section 201(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(c)), are prescribed in part 101&#x2013;46.

####### § 101-25.103 Promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods.

####### § 101-25.103-1 General.

Federal agencies in a position to receive promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods shall establish internal procedures for the receipt and disposition of these gratuities in accordance with § 101&#x2013;25.103. The procedures shall provide for a minimum of administrative and accounting controls.

####### § 101-25.103-2 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.103-3 Trading stamps or bonus goods received from contractors.

When contracts contain a price reduction clause, any method (such as trading stamps or bonus goods) by which the price of a commodity or service is effectively reduced shall constitute a price reduction. Temporary or promotional price reductions are to be made available to contracting officers under the same terms and conditions as to other customers. Procuring activities, however, rather than accept trading stamps and bonus goods, shall attempt to deduct the cost of such items from the contract price. If obtaining such a price reduction is not possible, the contracting officer shall document the contract file to that effect and dispose of the items as provided in § 101&#x2013;25.103.4.

####### § 101-25.103-4 Disposition of promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods.

(a) Agencies shall, through the lowest appropriate activity, arrange for transfer of promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods, without reimbursement in accordance with internal agency procedures to a nearby Federal hospital or similar institution operated, managed, or supervised by the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Veterans Administration (VA) when:

(1) The contract does not contain a price reduction clause, or

(2) The contractor refuses to grant a price reduction, and

(3) It is deemed practical and in the best interest of the Government to accept such promotional items as a price reduction, and

(4) The procuring or receiving agency has no practical use for the promotional items.

(b) Before transferring promotional materials, trading stamps, or bonus goods to the above Federal institutions, it must be determined that the proposed recipient is prepared to receive and use such items. If these items cannot be used by the receiving agency or a medical facility, they should be disposed of in accordance with 41 CFR 101&#x2013;43, 44 and 45.

####### § 101-25.104 Acquisition of office furniture and office machines.

Each executive agency shall make a determination as to whether the requirements of the agency can be met through the utilization of already owned items prior to the acquisition of new furniture or office machines. The acquisition of new items shall be limited to those requirements which are considered absolutely essential and shall not include upgrading to improve appearance, office decor, or status, or to satisfy the desire for the latest design or more expensive lines.

(a) Generally acquisition of additional furniture or office machines from any source will be authorized only under the following circumstances, limited to the least expensive lines which will meet the requirement (see § 101&#x2013;26.408 of this chapter with respect to items such as typewriters under Federal Supply Schedule contracts), and the justification for the action shall be fully documented in the agency file:

(1) For essential requirements arising from quantitative increases in onboard employment which constitute the total requirement of any agency or major component thereof (e.g. bureau, service, office).

(2) For essential requirements arising from a need not related to onboard employment increases but which are determined necessary to avoid impairment of program efficiency.

(b) Each agency shall restrict replacement of furniture or office machines either to usable excess, rehabilitated, or the least expensive new lines available which will meet the requirement under the following circumstances, authority for which will meet the requirement under the following circumstances, authority for which shall be fully documented in the agency file:

(1) Where the agency determines that the item is not economically repairable.

(2) Where reductions in office space occupancy are accomplished through use of more convenient or smaller size furniture and the space economies thus achieved offset the cost of the furniture to be acquired.

####### § 101-25.104-1 Redistribution, repair, or rehabilitation.

Prior to the purchase of new office furniture and office machines, agencies shall fulfill needs insofar as practicable through redistribution, repair, or rehabilitation of already owned furniture and office machines. In furtherance of the use of rehabilitated furniture and office machines, agencies shall review inventories on a continuing basis to ascertain those items which can be economically rehabilitated and institute programs for their orderly repair and rehabilitation. All such items which are not required for immediate needs shall be reported as excess.

####### § 101-25.105 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.106 Servicing of office machines.

(a) The determination as to whether office machines are to be serviced by use of annual maintenance contracts or per-call arrangements shall be made in each case after comparison of the relative cost affecting specific types of equipment in a particular location and consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Prior to making the determination required by paragraph (a) of this section, consideration shall be given to:

(1) Standard of performance required;

(2) Degree of reliability needed;

(3) Environmental factors; i.e., dusty surroundings or other unfavorable conditions;

(4) Proximity to available repair facilities;

(5) Past experience with service facility; i.e., reputation, performance record, quality of work, etc.;

(6) Daily use (heavy or light) and operator's care of machine;

(7) Age and performance record of machine;

(8) Machine inventory in relation to operating needs; i.e., availability of reserve machine in case of breakdown;

(9) Number of machines; including overall frequency of repairs required;

(10) Security restrictions, if any; and

(11) Other pertinent factors.

####### § 101-25.107 Guidelines for requisitioning and proper use of consumable or low cost items.

Consumable and low value items in inventory (cupboard stocks are not considered inventory) are subject to accounting and inventory record controls in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the principles and standards prescribed by the General Accounting Office, 2 GAO 12.5. Normally, however, the systems of control for such property cease at the time of issuance from a warehouse or storeroom to the consumer.

(a) The guidelines set forth in this § 101&#x2013;25.107 are considered minimum to assure proper use of consumable or low cost items by individuals, subsequent to issue from accountable records and termination of formal accountability. Consumable items, for the purpose of this section, are considered to include those items actually consumed in use (e.g., pads and pencils) and those items required in performance of duties but for which, primarily by reason of the low value involved, no formal accountability is maintained after issue, and are generally referred to as “expendable.”

(b) Approval of requisitions for replenishment of cupboard storeroom stocks should be restricted to officials at a responsible supervisory level to ensure that supply requirements are justified on the basis of essentiality and quantity. Where requisitions are not required, such as in obtaining items from GSA customer supply centers, informal “shopping lists” should be approved at the same level.

(c) Adequate safeguards and controls should be established to assure that issues of expendable supplies are made for official use only. In appropriate situations, this will include identification of individuals to whom expendable supplies have been issued. Experience has indicated, also, that certain items of expendables should not be displayed either at seasonal periods of the year or on a permanent basis.

(d) The items listed below have from experience proven to be personally attractive and particularly susceptible to being used for other than official duties. Agencies should give special attention to these and any other consumable or low cost items when issues are excessive when compared with normal program needs.

####### § 101-25.108 Multiyear subscriptions for publications.

Subscriptions for periodicals, newspapers, and other publications for which it is known in advance that a continuing requirement exists should be for multiple years rather than for a single year where such method is advantageous for the purpose of economy or otherwise. Where various bureaus or offices in the same agency are subscribing to the same publication, consideration shall be given to consolidating these requirements, to the extent practical, on an agency-wide basis and on a multiyear basis. Payment covering issues to be delivered during the entire subscription period may be made in advance from currently available appropriations (31 U.S.C. 530a).

####### § 101-25.109 Laboratory and research equipment.

(a) This section prescribes controls for use by Federal agencies in managing laboratory and research equipment in Federal laboratories. Agencies may establish such additional controls as are appropriate to increase the use of already-owned equipment instead of procuring similar equipment.

(b) The termas used in this section, means any laboratory or laboratory facility in any Government-owned or -leased building which is equipped and/or used for scientific research, testing, or analysis, except clinical laboratories operating in direct support of Federal health care programs. To the extent practicable, agencies should observe the provisions of this section with regard to commercial laboratories and laboratory facilities which operate under contract with the Government and use Government-furnished equipment.

####### § 101-25.109-1 Identification of idle equipment.

(a) The provisions of this § 101&#x2013;25.109&#x2013;1 apply to all Federal laboratories regardless of size.

(b) Inspection tours of Federal laboratories shall be conducted on a scheduled basis, annually, if feasible, but no less than every 2 years, for the purpose of identifying idle and unneeded laboratory and research equipment. Following each tour, a report of findings shall be prepared by the inspection team and, as determined by the agency head or his designee, submitted to the head of the laboratory or to a higher agency official having laboratories management responsibility. Equipment identified by the inspection team as idle or unneeded shall be reassigned as needed within the laboratory, placed in an equipment pool, or declared excess and made available to other agencies in accordance with part 101&#x2013;43.

(c) Laboratory inspection teams shall be comprised of senior program management, property management, and scientific personnel who are familiar with the plans and programs of the laboratory(ies) and who have a knowledge of laboratory and research equipment utilization. As determined by the agency head or his designee, members of an inspection team shall be appointed by either the head of the laboratory or a higher agency official having laboratories management responsibility.

(d) The agency head or his designee shall ensure compliance by responsible personnel with the requirements of this § 101&#x2013;25.109&#x2013;1 and shall require that periodic independent reviews of walk-through procedures employed in Federal laboratories under his control be conducted to determine their effectiveness and to effect modifications as appropriate.

####### § 101-25.109-2 Equipment pools.

(a) The provisions of this § 101&#x2013;25.109&#x2013;2 apply to Federal laboratories which occupy an area of 10,000 square feet or more and employ 25 or more technical or scientific personnel.

(b) Equipment pools shall be established in Federal laboratories so that laboratory and research equipment can be shared or allocated on a temporary basis to laboratory activities and individuals whose average use does not warrant the assignment of the equipment on a permanent basis. In determining the number and location of equipment pools, consideration shall be given to economy of operation, mobility of equipment, accessibility to users, frequency of use of the equipment, and impact on research programs. Pooling operations should begin expeditiously, within 120 days, if feasible, following decisions regarding the number and location of pools. If it is determined that an equipment pool would not be practical or economical or for any other reason is not needed at a particular laboratory, a written report supporting that determination shall be submitted to the agency head or his designee. Federal laboratories which do not meet the size and staffing criteria in § 101&#x2013;25.109&#x2013;2(a) should also establish equipment pools whenever feasible; however, these facilities need not submit written reports regarding determinations not to establish pools.

(c) Where the establishment of a physical pool would be economically unfeasible due to excessive transportation and handling costs, limited personnel resources, or limited space, pooling may be accomplished by means of equipment listings. Consideration should be given to the establishment of a laboratory advisory committee consisting of technical and management personnel to determine the types of equipment to be shared or pooled and to identify equipment that is no longer required.

(1) Equipment pools may also be used to fill requests for temporary replacements while permanently assigned equipment is being repaired or to provide equipment for new laboratories pending acquisition of permanent equipment.

(2) Although specific pieces of laboratory equipment may not be available for assignment to equipment pools, they may be available for sharing or loan. Information concerning the availability of this equipment can be maintained at a central location such as the equipment pools.

(d) Unless determined unnecessary by the agency head or his designee, each Federal laboratory operating equipment pools shall prepare and submit to the agency head or his designee an annual report concerning the use and effectiveness of equipment pooling.

(e) The agency head or his designee shall ensure compliance by responsible personnel with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;25.109&#x2013;2 and shall require that periodic independent reviews of equipment pool operations in Federal laboratories under his control be conducted to determine their effectiveness and to effect modifications as appropriate.

####### § 101-25.110 Tire identification/registration program.

The regulations issued by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR part 574, Tire Identification and Recordkeeping, require that tire manufacturers maintain or have maintained for them the name and address of tire purchasers, the identification number of each tire sold, and the name and address of the tire seller (or other means by which the manufacturer can identify the tire seller). In addition, distributors and dealers are required to furnish such data to manufacturers in connection with purchases made directly from them. GSA provides support to the Federal Government for tires, and therefore has prescribed the following procedures for tires purchased from or through GSA supply sources.

####### § 101-25.110-1 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.110-2 Tires obtained through Federal Supply Schedules or regional term contracts.

When tire manufacturers ship tires direct against orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules, the tire manufacturer will record the name and address of the purchaser and the identification numbers of the tires involved.

####### § 101-25.110-3 Tires accompanying new motor vehicles.

The tire identifications and recordkeeping regulations issued by the Department of Transportation require each motor vehicle manufacturer or his designee to maintain a record of tires on or in each vehicle shipped by him together with the name and address of the first purchaser.

####### § 101-25.110-4 Recordkeeping responsibilities.

The effectiveness of the tire identification and recordkeeping regulations depends on the active support and cooperation of all agencies to ensure that tires subject to a recall program are not to continue in service thereby endangering the lives of the occupants of the vehicle. Therefore, agencies should establish procedures for promptly identifying and locating all tires whether in storage or on vehicles so that advice from GSA, the tire manufacturer, or the vehicle manufacturer may be acted upon expeditiously.

####### § 101-25.111 Environmental impact policy.

(a) From time to time, Congress enacts legislation pertaining to the protection and enhancement of the Nation's environment; e.g., the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321). The objective of such legislation is, among other things, the improvement of the relationship between people and their environment and the lessening of hazards affecting their health and safety. It is the policy of the General Services Administration to appropriately implement the various provisions of these Acts of Congress as fully as statutory authority permits in support of the national policy.

(b) With respect to the procurement, management, and disposal of personal property, the implementation of national environmental policy is provided through amendments to the regulations of GSA, changes to Federal specifications and standards documents, as appropriate, and other actions as may be required when expediency is of prime importance. Further, the Federal regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items supplied through the Federal supply system that are known to contain components or possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Each agency, therefore, shall take action as necessary to ensure that the objectives and directives of the National Environmental Policy Act, other environmental statutes, and applicable regulations are met; especially the directive that environmental concerns, effects, and values shall be given appropriate consideration with economic and technical issues in decisionmaking. Action should include a continuing review of theand issuances promulgated by the Federal regulatory agencies for guidance applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items that are known to contain components or to possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions.

####### § 101-25.112 Energy conservation policy.

(a) Agency officials responsible for procurement, management, and disposal of personal property and nonpersonal services shall ensure that pertinent procurement and property management documents reflect the policy set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, which has been established pursuant to Public Law 94&#x2013;163, Energy Policy and Conservation Act.

(b) With respect to the procurement or lease of personal property or nonpersonal services, which in operation consume energy or contribute to the conservation of energy, executive agencies shall promote energy conservation and energy efficiency by being responsive to the energy efficiency and/or conservation standards or goals prescribed by the U.S. Government.

####### § 101-25.113 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.114 Supply management surveys and assistance.

Under the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 487, the General Services Administration will perform surveys and/or reviews of Government property and property management practices of executive agencies. These surveys or reviews will be conducted by the Federal Supply Service in connection with regular surveys and studies of agency supply management practices or when providing assistance in the development of agency property accounting systems. Written reports of findings and recommendations will be provided to agency heads.

###### Subpart 101-25.2 - Interagency Purchase Assignments

####### § 101-25.201 General.

(a) This subpart prescribes the basic policy for interagency purchase assignments within the executive branch of the Government. It is directly applicable to executive agencies and concerns other Federal agencies in their purchasing from, through, or under contracts made by executive agencies.

(b) The termas used in this subpart shall normally be considered to include performance of the following functions:

(1) Arranging with requiring agencies for phased submission of requirements and procurement requisitions.

(2) Soliciting and analyzing bids and negotiating, awarding, and executing contracts.

(3) General contract administration.

(4) Arranging for inspection and delivery.

(5) Promotion of a maximum practicable degree of standardization in specifications and establishment of Federal Specifications, when possible, in accordance with applicable regulations.

(c) Notice of purchase assignments and applicable delegations of authority, made under the provisions of this subpart 101&#x2013;25.2, shall be furnished to the General Accounting Office by GSA.

####### § 101-25.202 Factors to be used to determine assignment of purchase responsibility.

With their consent or upon direction of the President, executive agencies will be designated and authorized by the Administrator of General Services exclusively, or with specified limited exceptions, to make purchases and contracts on a continuing basis for items or item groups of articles and services for the executive branch of the Government, after due consideration of the following factors, weighted as appropriate:

(a) Current or potential predominant use or consumption by a given agency.

(b) Availability of funds to carry out the assignment on a Government-wide basis or with limited exceptions.

(c) Specialized personnel, or the nucleus of such personnel, regularly employed by the agency, such as scientific, research, and operating technicians, especially qualified or experienced in specification writing, buying, inspecting, testing, using, installing, or operating a particular item or group of items.

(d) Custodianship and operation of special facilities such as research and testing laboratories and inspection or testing stations and devices.

(e) Actual or potential qualifications and experience of agency purchasing and contracting officials and their operating units with due regard to adequacy of staff.

(f) Past experience of the agency in performing services to other agencies on an informal or joint cooperative basis.

(g) Relations of the agency with the industry involved.

(h) Physical proximity of the agency purchasing office or offices to the requirement-compiling elements of the principal using agencies.

(i) Physical location of the agency purchasing office or offices in relation to market areas.

(j) Physical proximity of the agency purchasing offices in relation to engineering or design offices, in the interest of speed in processing modifications in design and specifications, and also reviewing bids for specifications compliance.

(k) Relative interest of agency heads in receiving the purchase assignment and specific requests of agency heads to do the buying of a given item or group of items on a Government-wide basis.

####### § 101-25.203 Centralized purchases by GSA.

GSA will exclusively, or with specified limited exceptions, make purchases and contracts on a continuing basis for articles and services for the executive branch of the Government in the interest of lower prices, improved quality, and service or standardization when:

(a) The item or item groups of articles and services are items of “common-use” which are defined as items of standard commercial production or items covered by Federal Specifications commonly used by both civilian and military activities, or by two or more civilian activities, and not requiring such substantial alterations to adapt them to military or other particular application as to render inclusion in a centralized purchasing program impracticable; or

(b) A number of agencies, representing the majority users according to dollar volume, request GSA to make purchases and contracts exclusively for a given item or item groups of articles and services even though not “common-use” items as defined in § 101&#x2013;25.203(a); and

(c) GSA is best equipped to do the buying based upon the factors listed in § 101&#x2013;25.202, or must of necessity act as the central purchasing office when other agencies more appropriately suited to make central purchases do not do so and are not so directed by the President; and

(d) The head of another executive agency has not been delegated authority by the Administrator of General Services exclusively, or with specified limited exceptions, to make purchases and contracts for prescribed items or item groups of articles and services for the executive branch of the Government in accordance with §§ 101&#x2013;25.202 and 101&#x2013;25.204.

(e) GSA has issued appropriate regulations, or a Federal Supply Schedule, specifically designating the item or item groups of articles or services that fall within paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this § 101&#x2013;25.203 that are thereafter to be purchased exclusively for all executive agencies, or with specified limited exceptions, by GSA.

####### § 101-25.204 Centralized purchases by designated executive agencies under authority delegated by the Administrator of General Services.

Designated executive agencies will exclusively, or with specified limited exceptions, make purchases and contracts on a continuing basis for items or item groups of articles and services for the executive branch of the Government in the interest of lower prices, improved quality, and service or standardization when:

(a) The Administrator of General Services has determined, based upon the factors listed in § 101&#x2013;25.202, that a selected executive agency is best equipped to perform certain purchasing and contracting functions, and the Administrator of General Services has issued appropriate regulations designating the categories of articles or services complying with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 101&#x2013;25.203 that are to be purchased exclusively by the named executive agency under authority delegated by the Administrator of General Services; and

(b) The head of the designated executive agency has issued appropriate instructions, or a Federal Supply Schedule, under authority as delegated by and in the form approved by the Administrator, specifically designating the item or item groups of articles or services that are thereafter to be purchased exclusively for all executive agencies, or with specified limited exceptions, by the designated executive agency.

####### § 101-25.205 Arrangement for performance of purchasing functions other than centralized.

(a) Upon request, GSA will make purchases and contracts for any of the items or item groups of articles or services authorized to be purchased independently by executive agencies. GSA will also arrange, on a basis mutually agreeable, with any executive agency to perform its purchase and contracting functions on a continuing basis, if requested in writing to do so by the agency head, provided the arrangements agreed upon will result in lowered cost or improved service either to the individual agency or to the Government as a whole.

(b) In those instances where lowered cost or improved service, either to an individual agency or to the Government as a whole will result, GSA will arrange, on a basis mutually agreeable to the agencies involved, to assign all or a portion of the purchase and contracting functions of one executive agency to another executive agency on a continuing basis.

####### § 101-25.206 Independent purchases by executive agencies.

Items or groups of items of articles or services may be purchased independently by executive agencies, in accordance with regulations of GSA otherwise applicable, when:

(a) Not otherwise prescribed in current regulations, or included in mandatory Federal Supply Schedules, issued by GSA or by another executive agency designated by the Administrator of General Services.

(b) For emergency requirements when time does not permit purchasing through the authorized central purchasing agency. A record shall be maintained of such transactions and be made available to the responsible central purchasing agency upon request.

(c) By consultation between GSA and agencies concerned, it is determined that interagency purchase assignment would adversely affect the national security or military operations.

(d) The purchases cannot be publicly disclosed in the interest of national security.

###### Subpart 101-25.3 - Use Standards

####### § 101-25.301 General.

(a) This subpart prescribes minimum use standards for certain Government-owned personal property which shall be applied by all executive agencies. Additional criteria above these minimum standards shall be established by each executive agency, limiting its property to the minimum requirements necessary for the efficient functioning of the particular office concerned. This subpart does not apply to automatic data processing equipment (ADPE) which is covered in the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) (41 CFR Chapter 201).

(b) Additional use standards should be established by all executive agencies for other Government-owned property under their control whenever use standards will effect economy and efficiency in the use of such property.

(c) All items of property, determined to be excess to the needs of an agency as a result of the application of use standards, shall be promptly reported in accordance with part 101&#x2013;43.

####### § 101-25.302 Office furniture, furnishings, and equipment.

(a) Each executive agency shall establish criteria for the use of office furniture, furnishings, and equipment. Such criteria shall be in consonance with the provisions of § 101&#x2013;25.104 pertaining to office furniture and office machines and shall be limited to the minimum essential requirements as established by the agency head for authorized functions and programs which will, beyond a reasonable doubt, be in operation within the following 6 months.

(b) In developing such criteria, a distinction shall be made between the requirements of organizational elements concerned with purely administrative functions, and those of a technical, scientific, or specialized nature.

(c) Items of office equipment, used only occasionally, should be pooled within an agency and made available to activities of the agency when and as necessary.

####### § 101-25.302-1 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.302-2 Filing cabinets.

Executive agencies shall make every effort to effect maximum use of filing cabinets and to limit the purchase of new equipment. Filing cabinets should be replaced only in accordance with the standards in subpart 101&#x2013;25.4. Maximum utilization of equipment should be obtained by:

(a) Disposing of all records that have been authorized for disposition by the Congress or, where such authorization has not been obtained, through the preparation and obtaining of authorized disposal schedules with the assistance of the National Archives and Records Administration.

(b) Removing office supplies, publications, and other nonrecord material from filing cabinets to more suitable storage equipment, except where the quantity of such material is small (as a rule, less than half a cabinet).

(c) Transferring to Federal Records Centers or approved agency records centers (to the extent that facilities are made available) inactive records not needed in daily business but not yet ready for disposal, when filing equipment can be released by such action.

(d) Shifting less active files, not transferable to approved records centers, to fiberboard storage boxes, using filing cabinets only when files are constantly used.

(e) Using filing cabinets with locks only when required by special needs that cannot be satisfied less expensively.

(f) Using letter-size filing cabinets instead of legal-size whenever possible.

(g) Using 5-drawer filing cabinets whenever available in lieu of 4-drawer cabinets.

####### §§ 101-25.302-3-101-25.302-4 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.302-5 Carpeting.

(a) Carpeting is authorized for use where it can be justified over other types of floor covering on the basis of cost, safety, insulation, acoustical control, the degree of interior decoration required, or the need to maintain an environment commensurate with the purpose for which the space is allocated.

(b) In connection with new construction or alteration of space, if it is known that the area will eventually require carpeting, then resilient floor covering should be omitted and the carpeting installed initially.

####### § 101-25.302-6 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.302-7 Draperies.

Draperies are authorized for use where justified over other types of window coverings on the basis of cost, insulation, acoustical control, or maintenance of an environment commensurate with the purpose for which the space is allocated. Determining whether the use of draperies is justified is a responsibility of the agency occupying the building or space involved after consultation with the agency operating or managing the building. Authorized draperies shall be of non-combustible or flame-resistant fabric as required in § 101&#x2013;20.105&#x2013;1.

###### Subpart 101-25.4 - Replacement Standards

####### § 101-25.401 General.

This subpart prescribes minimum replacement standards to be used by executive agencies desiring to replace specified types of items indicated in this subpart. Executive agencies shall retain items which are in usable workable condition even though the standard permits replacement, provided the item can continue to be used or operated without excessive maintenance cost or substantial reduction in trade-in value.

####### § 101-25.402 Motor vehicles.

Replacement of motor vehicles shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed in § 101&#x2013;38.402.

####### § 101-25.403 [Reserved]

####### § 101-25.404 Furniture.

Furniture (office, household and quarters, and institutional) shall not be replaced unless the estimated cost of repair or rehabilitation (based on GSA term contracts), including any transportation expense, exceeds at least 75 percent of the cost of a new item of the same type and class (based on prices as shown in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog, applicable Federal Supply Schedules, or the lowest available market price). An exception is authorized in those unusual situations in which rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 percent or less of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with the cost of rehabilitation as determined by the agency head or his designee.

####### § 101-25.404-1 Limitation.

Nothwithstanding the provisions in § 101&#x2013;25.404, agencies shall limit acquisition of new office furniture to essential requirements as provided in § 101&#x2013;25.104. Replacement of correspondence filing cabinets will be governed by the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.308.

####### § 101-25.405 Materials handling equipment.

(a) Materials handling equipment will not be replaced unless the estimated cost of necessary one-time repair or reconditioning of each piece of equipment exceeds, at lowest available cost, the applicable percentage of acquisition cost as shown in column 3 of the following table. Equipment eligible for replacement under the criteria established by this standard may be repaired provided the expected economical life is extended commensurate with the expenditure required. Prior to incurring repair costs for equipment eligible for replacement, consideration should be given to the continuing availability of repair parts.

(1) Years in use shall be determined in accordance with the following:

(i) An operating month is considered equal to 100 operating hours. For materials handling equipment in storage, one month in storage equals 50 hours of operation.

(ii) The number of years in use is determined by dividing the number of operating months by 12. The fractional years in use resulting from this computation will be rounded to the nearest full year.

(2) In using the maximum allowable one-time repair limits in column 3 of the table, costs such as parts, labor, and transportation incident to the repairs, are to be included in computing one-time repair costs. However, operating expenses such as fuels and lubricants, replacement tires and batteries, and antifreeze will not be included in the one-time repair cost estimate.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations prescribed in § 101&#x2013;25.405(a), materials handling equipment may be replaced under the following conditions provided a written justification supporting such replacement is approved by the agency head or an authorized designee. The justification shall be retained in the agency files.

(1) When the cumulative repair costs on a piece of equipment appears to be excessive as indicated by repair records. However, because an item of equipment accrues repair costs equal to the acquisition cost, it is not necessarily indicative of the current condition of the equipment. For example, a substantial repair expenditure included in the cumulative cost may actually have resulted in restoring the equipment to as good as new condition. While cumulative repair costs suggest an area for investigation, they should not be used as the principal ingredient in the repair/replacement decision making process.

(2) When repair parts are not available causing excessive equipment out-of-service time.

(3) When the equipment lacks essential features required in a particular task which is of a continuing nature and other suitable equipment is not readily available.

###### Subpart 101-25.5 - Purchase or Lease Determinations

####### § 101-25.500 Cross-reference to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1, parts 1-99).

For guidance see Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 7.4 (48 CFR Subpart 7.4).

###### Subparts 101-25.6 - 101-25.49 [Reserved]

###### § 101-25.000 Scope of subchapter.

This subchapter provides policies and guidelines pertaining to the general area of supply management designed to support the logistical programs of the Federal Government. It consists of parts 101&#x2013;25 through 101&#x2013;34 and provides for applicability of coverage within each of these several parts.

###### § 101-25.001 Scope of part.

This part provides policies and guidelines pertaining to subject matter in the general area of supply management which is not appropriate for coverage in other parts of this subchapter E.

##### PART 101-26 - PROCUREMENT SOURCES AND PROGRAM

###### Subpart 101-26.1 - General

####### § 101-26.100 Scope of subpart.

This subpart provides policy guidance of a general nature concerning procurement of lowest cost items obtainable from GSA supply sources; availability from GSA of special buying services in addition to the specified GSA procurement sources; criteria for placing end-of-year purchase documents with GSA and for insuring that end-of-year requisitions placed with GSA obligate the applicable fiscal year appropriation; and justification requirements to support negotiated procurement by GSA for other agencies.

####### § 101-26.100-1 Procurement of lowest cost items.

GSA provides lines of similar items to meet particular end-use requirements under the GSA stock program, special order program (SOP) established source, and the Federal Supply Schedule program. Although these similar items may differ in terms of price, quality, and essential characteristics, they often can serve the same functional end-use procurement needs of the various ordering agencies. Therefore, in submitting requisitions or placing delivery orders for similar items obtainable from GSA sources, agencies shall utilize the source from which the lowest cost item can be obtained which will adequately serve the functional end-use purpose.

####### § 101-26.100-2 Request for waivers.

Waiver requests, when required by § 101&#x2013;26.102&#x2013;1 (special order program established source items), § 101&#x2013;26.301 (GSA stock items) or § 101&#x2013;26.401&#x2013;3(b) (Federal Supply Schedule items), shall be submitted to the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service (F), General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20406. Waiver requests will be approved if considered justified. Approval of a waiver request does not constitute authority for a sole source procurement. Depending on the basis for the waiver request, each request shall contain the following information:

(a) Waiver requests based on determination that the GSA item is not of the requisite quality or will not serve the required functional end-use purpose of the agency requesting the waiver shall include the following information with each request:

(1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the requirement. Descriptive literature such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures which show the characteristics or construction of the type of item or an explanation of the operation should be furnished whenever possible.

(2) The item description and the stock number (NSN if possible) of the GSA item being compared. Inadequacies of the GSA items in performing the required functions.

(3) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or unpredictable, so state.)

(4) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when questions arise concerning the request.

(5) Other pertinent data, when applicable.

(b) Waiver request based on determination that the GSA item can be purchased locally at a lower price shall include the following information with each request. However, the price alone of an item without other substantive consideration will not be considered sufficient justification to approve a waiver request.

(1) A complete description of the type of item needed to satisfy the requirement.

(2) The quantity required. (If demand is recurrent, nonrecurrent, or unpredictable, so state.)

(3) The destination of item to be delivered.

(4) The name and address of source.

(5) A price comparison with the GSA item, including the NSN of the GSA item. Cost comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost to effect the local purchase.

(6) The name and telephone number of the person to be contacted when questions arise concerning the request.

(7) Other pertinent data, when applicable.

(c) When the item is a Standard or optional form available from GSA stock, the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.302 apply.

(d) Agencies shall not initiate action to procure similar items from non-GSA sources until a request for a waiver has been requested from and approved by GSA. The fact that action to procure a similar item has been initiated will not influence GSA action on a request for waiver.

(e) Waivers are not required for items or services procured in accordance with the policy set forth in § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;1 relating to the acquisition of the lowest cost item from GSA sources, § 101&#x2013;26.401&#x2013;4(f) relating to the purchase of products that are available at prices lower than the prices of identical products provided by multiple award Federal Supply Schedule contracts, or when an urgent requirement exists in accordance with FAR 6.302&#x2013;2 (48 CFR 6.302&#x2013;2).

####### § 101-26.100-3 Warranties.

Through its procurement sources and programs GSA provides for certain types of items and services which are covered by warranties. Such warranties allow ordering activities additional time after acceptance within which to assert a right to correct certain deficiencies in supplies or services furnished. The additional time period and the specific corrective actions for which the contractor is responsible are usually stated in the warranty. Items and services subject to warranties are normally identified by a warranty marking or notice. Such marking or notice will state that a warranty exists, its extent of coverage, its duration, and whom to notify concerning defects. Using activities shall take the following actions when items or services (except for automotive vehicles and components which are subject to the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;6) covered by warranty provisions are found to be defective during the warranty period.

(a) Activities shall attempt to resolve all complaints where a warranty is involved. If the contractor replaces the item or corrects the deficiency, a Standard Form (SF) 368, Product Quality Deficiency Report, in duplicate, shall be sent to the GSA Discrepancy Reports Center (6FR), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131&#x2013;3088. The resolution of the case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 368. This information will be maintained as a quality history file for use in future procurements.

(b) If the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace, a defective item or an aspect of service under the warranty, an SF 368, in duplicate, along with copies of all pertinent correspondence, shall be submitted to the contracting officer in the appropriate GSA commodity center for necessary action. The address of the contracting officer is contained in the contract/purchase order, except for schedule items where the address is shown in the Federal Supply Schedule.

####### § 101-26.101 Utilization of long supply and excess personal property.

To the fullest extent practicable, agencies shall utilize inventories in long supply, as prescribed in subpart 101&#x2013;27.3, and excess personal property, as prescribed in part 101&#x2013;43, as a first source of supply in fulfilling their requirements.

####### § 101-26.102 Special buying services.

####### § 101-26.102-1 General.

The special buying services of GSA are performed through the GSA special order program (SOP). The SOP allows an agency to obtain items not included in either the GSA stock or Federal Supply Schedule program. All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's centralized supply system, shall request SOP items by submitting requisitions for GSA centrally managed items to GSA. GSA will process all requisitions for SOP items, regardless of total line item value, from activities electing to purchase from GSA. If an agency determines that alternative sources are more favorable, procurement from other sources is authorized: Provided, that the dollar thresholds and criteria outlined in § 101&#x2013;26.301(b)(1) through (3) are followed.

####### § 101-26.102-2 Utilization by military agencies.

Military activities shall utilize the buying services of GSA when:

(a) GSA has agreed with the Secretary of Defense, or with the Secretary of a military department in connection with the requirements of that department, to perform such buying services; and

(b) The items involved are not properly obtainable from GSA stock or Federal Supply Schedules.

####### § 101-26.102-3 Procurement leadtime.

When GSA performs the purchasing services for other agencies or activities as contemplated by this § 101&#x2013;26.102&#x2013;3, calculation of the delivery dates required for the items involved must be based on the procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide. These leadtimes are based on the normal time required after receipt of agency requisitions by GSA to effect delivery to destinations within the 50 States.

(a) Time required to obtain any additional essential information from the requisitioning office for use in issuing a solicitation for bids or offers is not included in the leadtimes.

(b) If unusually large quantities or complex items are required, leadtime adjustments should be made to reflect the specific requirement. As an example, standard furniture items can usually be delivered in less than 90 days after receipt of the requisition. However, for large quantity or complex orders requiring a definite quantity procurement, delivery times may range from 4 to 6 months. Footnotes relating to classes where this is a frequent occurrence are shown in the procurement leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide.

(c) The procurement leadtime table illustrated in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide does not apply to public exigency or other high priority requisitions; however, it should be used as a guide to establish realistic required delivery dates for such requisitions.

####### § 101-26.102-4 Payment to GSA contractors.

Policies and procedures covering payment to GSA contractors for supplies and services furnished by GSA to Government agencies are in subpart 101&#x2013;2.1.

####### § 101-26.103 Establishing essentiality of requirements.

####### § 101-26.103-1 Policy for personal property.

To obtain maximum benefit from Government funds available for procurement of personal property, each executive agency shall:

(a) Insure that personal property currently on hand is being utilized to the fullest extent practical and provide supporting justification prior to effecting new procurement for similar type property. (When the proposed procurement is for similar items from non-GSA sources, the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;2 apply.)

(b) Procure the minimum quantity and quality of property which is required to support the mission of the agency and to satisfy the function for which the property is required.

(c) Limit procurement of different varieties, types, sizes, colors, etc., of required items to those essential in satisfying the functional end-use purpose. To this end the quantity, quality, and variety of personal property required to adequately perform the end-use function should be determined prior to initiation of procurement processes.

####### § 101-26.103-2 Restriction on personal convenience items.

Government funds may be expended for pictures, objects of art, plants, or flowers (both artificial and real), or any other similar type items when such items are included in a plan for the decoration of Federal buildings approved by the agency responsible for the design and construction. Determinations as to the need for purchasing such items for use in space assigned to any agency are judgments reserved to the agency. Determinations with respect to public space such as corridors and lobbies are reserved to the agency responsible for operation of the building. Except as otherwise authorized by law, Government funds shall not be expended for pictures, objects of art, plants, flowers (both artificial and real), or any other similar type items intended solely for the personal convenience or to satisfy the personal desire of an official or employee. These items fall into the category of “luxury items” since they do not contribute to the fulfillment of missions normally assigned to Federal agencies.

####### § 101-26.104 End-of-year submission of requisitions for action by GSA.

(a) Purchase documents for supplies or services submitted to GSA at or near the close of a fiscal year shall reflect actual agency requirements and shall not be used as a means of exhausting appropriation balances.

(b) Under the FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP systems, the requisitions submitted to GSA are not required to reflect the applicable appropriation or fiscal year funds to be charged. The fund code entry on the requisition simply indicates to the supply source (GSA) that funds are available to pay the charge, thereby providing authority for the release of material and subsequent billing. Requisitions received by GSA in purchase authority format are normally converted to FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP documentation so that processing can be accomplished expeditiously through a uniform system based on the use of automated equipment. Accordingly, primary responsibility rests with the ordering activity for ensuring that requisitions intended to be chargeable to appropriations expiring the last day of the fiscal year are submitted in sufficient time for GSA to consummate the necessary action before the end of the fiscal year. Requisitions submitted on or before the last day of the fiscal year may be chargeable to appropriations expiring on that date provided the ordering agency is required by law or GSA regulation to use GSA supply sources. When the ordering agency is not required to use GSA sources, requisitions for GSA stock items may be recorded as obligations provided the items are intended to meet a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the need arises or to replace stock used in that fiscal year; requests for other than GSA stock items are to be recorded as obligations at the time GSA awards a contract for the required items. In the latter case, GSA procurement leadtimes illustrated in the GSA publication, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, should be used as a guide for timely submission of these requisitions. The leadtimes referred to relate to the number of days between submission of a requisition and actual delivery of the items involved. While this may furnish some guidance to requisitioners, there is no direct relationship between those leadtimes and the time it takes for GSA to make an award of a contract.

(c) End-of-year submission of requisitions which require GSA to award a contract not later than the last day of the fiscal year in order to obligate the appropriation or funds of the ordering agency will be annotated to indicate that GSA procurement of the requested items must be accomplished not later than the last day of the fiscal year in which the requisitions are submitted. For example, a FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP requisition should be prepared to include Document Identifier Code A0E or A05 and reflect the annotation in the “Remarks” block. With this information GSA will attempt to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year. When a requistion is received too late to permit GSA to complete procurement action before the end of the fiscal year, the requisitioning activity will be so notified and requested to furnish instructions regarding the action to be taken. Based on these instructions, procurement action will be taken or the requisition will be canceled and returned to the ordering activity.

####### § 101-26.105 Justification to support negotiated procurement by GSA for other agencies.

When a requisition submitted by an agency to GSA requires procurement without providing for full and open competition, the agency submitting the requisition will be so notified and required to furnish specific information to assist GSA in preparing the required written justification. The GSA contracting officer will defer procurement action pending receipt of the requested information. If the requisitioning agency has prior knowledge that a requisition will require procurement without providing for full and open competition (e.g., sole source acquisition), sufficient information shall be included with the requisition to allow GSA to justify the procurement. Specifically, the information must include the following:

(a) The specific needs to be satisfied in terms of identified tasks or work processes;

(b) The requirements that generate the specific needs;

(c) The characteristics of the designated item that enable it to satisfy the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;

(d) The identification of other items evaluated and, for each, a statement of the characteristics (or lack thereof) which preclude their satisfying the specific needs, if a specific source(s) is requested;

(e) The citation of the applicable law, if any, authorizing other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302 (48 CFR 6.302); and

(f) Any required certifications, pursuant to FAR 6.303&#x2013;2(b) (48 CFR 6.303&#x2013;2(b)), that supporting data is complete and accurate.

####### § 101-26.106 Consolidation of requirements.

Full consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual small volume requirements to enable the Government to benefit from lower prices normally obtainable through definite quantity contracts for larger volume procurements. This policy pertains to procurement from commercial sources either directly or through an intermediary agency and does not apply to GSA stock items or small volume requirements normally obtained from GSA customer supply centers. When it is practical, each agency shall establish procedures that will permit planned requirements consolidation on an agencywide basis. When it is impractical to plan requirements on an agencywide consolidated basis, the requirements consolidation effort may be limited to a bureau, to other agency segments, or to a program, if such limited consolidation will provide significant price advantages when procurement is effected on a volume basis. Requisitions for item requirements exceeding maximum order limitations in Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to GSA in accordance with the applicable instructions in the respective schedules. Special buying services desired by agencies for procurement of other consolidated item requirements shall be requested from GSA in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.102.

###### Subpart 101-26.2 - Federal Requisitioning System

####### § 101-26.200 Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes a uniform requisitioning and issue system for use in obtaining supplies and equipment from GSA, Department of Defense, and Veterans Administration sources.

####### § 101-26.201 General.

This requisitioning and issue system is identified as the Federal Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (FEDSTRIP) and is similar to and compatible with the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP). The FEDSTRIP system provides GSA and other supply sources the means to automate the processing of requisitions. Detailed instructions required to implement FEDSTRIP are contained in the GSA Handbook, FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101&#x2013;26.2), which is issued and maintained by the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service, GSA.

####### § 101-26.202 Applicability.

The FEDSTRIP system shall be used by civilian agencies to requisition any item from GSA or to requisition any specifically authorized item from Department of Defense (DOD). Requisitions to the Veterans Administration (VA) should be submitted on punched cards in FEDSTRIP format or typed on Standard Form 147, Order for Supplies or Services.

####### § 101-26.203 Activity address codes.

To obtain items through the FEDSTRIP system, each ordering activity is required to have an activity address code. The FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101&#x2013;26.2) contains instructions to civilian agencies on requesting activity address codes. Once assigned, an activity address code allows an activity to order supplies under the FEDSTRIP system. Because there is a potential for abuse in the use of these codes, agencies shall establish stringent internal controls to ensure that the codes are used only by authorized personnel. It is imperative that all requests for activity address codes or deletions or address changes flow through a central contact point in the agency headquarters or regions where the need, purpose, and validity of the request can be verified. Agencies should send GSA the addresses of the contact points (mailing address: General Services Administration (FSR), Washington, DC 20406). GSA will only honor requests from the established points within the agency. GSA will periodically send a listing of current activity address codes and addresses to contact points for review.

####### §§ 101-26.204-101-26.205 [Reserved]

####### § 101-26.206 GSA assistance.

Agency field activities should direct their questions regarding FEDSTRIP to the Federal Supply Service at each GSA regional office. The addresses of GSA regional offices are listed in each of the volumes of the GSA Supply Catalog. Agency headquarters activities requiring assistance may contact General Services Administration (FSR), Washington, DC 20406.

###### Subpart 101-26.3 - Procurement of GSA Stock Items

####### § 101-26.300 Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes policy and procedures governing the procurement by agencies of items of supply stocked by GSA, including reporting and obtaining adjustments for overages, shortages, and damages and the issue of used, repaired, and rehabilitated items in serviceable condition.

####### § 101-26.301 Applicability.

All executive agencies within the United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), in order to maximize the use of the Government's centralized supply system, shall requisition GSA stock items in accordance with the following:

(a) When the requirement is for Standard and optional forms, an item produced by the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), or an item listed in the procurement list published by the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped (NIB-NISH), the dollar thresholds and language indicated in paragraph (b) of this section are not applicable and acquisition of such items continues to be as set forth in the applicable sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Federal Property Management Regulations and other appropriate regulations. In order to identify FPI/NIB-NISH items stocked by GSA, they are marked with an asterisk in the GSA Supply Catalog NSN index,

(b) GSA will process all requisitions for stock items, regardless of total line item value, from activities electing to purchase from GSA. If an agency determines that alternative sources are more favorable, the following guidelines shall apply. However, the price alone of an item without other substantive consideration will not be considered as sufficient justification to use alternative sources. (These guidelines also apply to the procurement of special order program (SOP) established source, see § 101&#x2013;26.102&#x2013;1.)

(1) When the total value of the line item requirement is less than $100, procurement from other sources is authorized.

(2) When the total value of the line item requirement is $100 or more, but less than $5,000, procurement from other sources is authorized: provided, that a written justification shall be prepared and placed in the purchase file stating that such action is judged to be in the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. Cost comparisons shall include the agency administrative cost to effect a local purchase.

(3) For total line item requirements of $5,000 and over, agencies shall submit a requisition to GSA unless a waiver has been approved by GSA. Request for waivers shall be submitted in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;2.

(c) Agencies shall not divide requisitions to avoid higher threshold documentation requirements.

(d) In authorizing procurements in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, agencies shall reimburse GSA for any cost arising out of breach of a GSA contract, where sufficient justification is not documented in their procurement files.

####### § 101-26.301-1 Similar items.

(a) Agencies required to requisition, exclusively, items listed in the GSA Supply Catalog shall utilize such items in lieu of procuring similar items from other sources when the GSA items will adequately serve the required functional end-use purpose.

(b) When an agency determines that items available from GSA stock will not serve the required functional end-use purpose of the item proposed to be procured, a request to waive the requirement to use this source shall be submitted to GSA for consideration in accordance with the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;2.

####### § 101-26.301-2 Issue of used, repaired, and rehabilitated items in serviceable condition.

Stock items returned to GSA under the provisions of subpart 101&#x2013;27.5 will be reissued to all requisitioning activities without distinction between new, used, repaired, or rehabilitated items in serviceable condition. Requisitioning agencies will be billed for these items at the current GSA selling price.

####### § 101-26.302 Standard and optional forms.

Agencies shall obtain Standard and optional forms by requisitioning them from GSA (FSS) unless the forms have been approved by GSA (KMPS) to be stocked and distributed by the promulgating agency or to be reproduced locally. Assistance or information on the forms management program may be obtained by contacting GSA (KMPS), Washington, DC 20405. (See part 201&#x2013;45, subpart 201&#x2013;45.5 of this chapter.)

(a) For purposes of economy, existing stocks are depleted prior to issuance of revisions unless the promulgating agency determines previous editions unusable and obsolete.

(b) Forms or form assemblies which deviate from the standard and optional forms listed in the GSA Supply Catalog have restricted use and are not stocked. Agencies requiring such forms shall prepare and transmit a Standard Form 1, Printing and Binding Requisition, or Standard Form 1&#x2013;C, Printing and Binding Requisition for Specialty Items, to the General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service (FCNI), Washington, DC 20406, for review and submission to GPO. Prior approval of GSA (KMPS) is required whenever the content or construction of a form is altered or modified. Requests for such exceptions may be obtained by submission of a SF 152, Requests for Clearance of a Standard or Optional Form or Exception, to GSA (KMPS), with appropriate justification.

(c) Certain standard forms are serially numbered and are to be accounted for to prevent possible fraudulent use. The General Accounting Office (GAO) requires accurate accountability records to be maintained for such items by applicable agencies. GSA forwards a receipt verification card with each shipment of accountable forms. The receiving agency is responsible for verifying receipt of the serially numbered forms in the shipment by returning the card to the address preprinted on the card. See § 101&#x2013;41.308 of this chapter for information governing agency control and disposition of unused U.S. Government Bills of Lading (GBL's).

(d) Standard and optional forms which are excess to the needs of an agency shall be reported to GSA in the same manner as other excess personal property pursuant to part 101&#x2013;43 of this chapter. Obsolete forms shall be disposed of under the provisions of part 101&#x2013;45 of this chapter.

####### § 101-26.303 Out-of-stock items.

Generally, it is more advantageous to agencies if GSA backorders requisitions for out-of-stock items rather than cancels requisitions. Unless notified by agencies not to backorder a requisition, through FEDSTRIP advice codes 2C or 2J, a back order will be established. The agency will be notified of the estimated date that shipment will be made. Upon receipt of the status transaction, the agency shall determine if the estimated shipping date will meet its needs and, as appropriate: (a) Accept the back order, (b) request a suitable substitute item, or (c) request cancellation in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.309.

####### § 101-26.304 Substitution policy.

In supplying items requisitioned from GSA stock, GSA may substitute items with similar characteristics. Substitute items may be issued from new stock or from returned stock that is in serviceable condition (condition code A) as described in § 101&#x2013;27.503&#x2013;1. A notice of intent to substitute will be provided to the ordering activity only if the characteristics of the substitute item differ substantially from the characteristics of the item requisitioned. Ordering activities may prevent substitution by entering advice code 2B (do not substitute) or 2J (do not substitute or backorder) in cc 65&#x2013;66 of requisitions.

####### § 101-26.305 Submission of orders to GSA.

(a) Orders shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions in the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide (FPMR 101&#x2013;26.2).

(b) Orders in other than FEDSTRIP format shall be submitted:

(1) In original only when for shipment to destinations in the United States, including Hawaii but excluding Alaska.

(2) In accordance with applicable GSA/agency agreements when for shipment to Alaska or for export to destinations outside the United States.

(c) Sufficient funds should be reserved by the requisitioner to cover expenses incurred by GSA in export packing, marking, documentation, etc. GSA will assess a surcharge on all material ordered and delivered to customers in certain overseas areas. The surcharge is a percentage factor of the value of the material shipped. Information on the specific areas and the current percentage of surcharge is included in the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101&#x2013;26.8). The surcharge is a percentage factor of the value of the material shipped. Information on the current percentage of surcharge may be obtained from the GSA regional office to which orders are submitted.

####### § 101-26.306 Planned requisitioning for GSA stock items.

In preparing requisitions for GSA stock items, agencies shall follow schedules or cyclical plans for replenishment of stocks so as to reduce the number of repetitive requisitions required while adjusting ordering frequency to comply with the economic order quantity principle. (See § 101&#x2013;27.102.)

####### § 101-26.307 Processing overages, shortages, and damages.

(a) Transportation-type discrepancies shall be processed in accordance with the instructions in subpart 101&#x2013;40.7 when the discrepancies are the fault of the carrier and occur while the shipments are in the possession of:

(1) International ocean or air carriers, regardless of who pays the transportation charges, except when shipment is on a through Government bill of lading (TGBL) or is made through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) (Discrepancies in shipments on a TGBL or which occur while in the DTS shall be reported as prescribed in subpart 101&#x2013;26.8.); or

(2) Carriers within the continental United States, when other than GSA or DOD pays the transportation charges.

(b) Reporting discrepancies or deficiencies in material or shipments and processing requests for or documenting adjustments in billings from or directed by GSA activities shall be in accordance with the provisions of subpart 101&#x2013;26.8.

####### § 101-26.308 Obtaining filing cabinets.

Each agency head, after taking actions prescribed in § 101&#x2013;25.302&#x2013;2, shall determine agency requirements for filing cabinets. When additional filing cabinets are required, requisitions shall be submitted in FEDSTRIP format to the GSA region supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioning agency is located.

####### § 101-26.309 Cancellation of orders for GSA stock items.

When an agency determines that material ordered from GSA is not required, GSA will accept requests for cancellation as long as the items ordered have not been shipped. However, since processing cancellations is costly and interferes with normal order processing, agencies are cautioned to use discretion in requesting cancellation of low dollar value orders. Cancellation of orders may be accomplished by agencies through written, telegraphic, or telephonic communication with the GSA regional office to which the order was sent. However, telephonic communication should be used whenever feasible to forestall shipment of material and subsequent billing by GSA. If material has been shipped, GSA will advise that cancellation cannot be effected and agency requests for return for credit will be processed under the provisions of §§ 101&#x2013;26.310 and 101&#x2013;26.311.

####### § 101-26.310 Ordering errors.

In accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.310, GSA may authorize agencies to return for credit material that has been ordered in error by the agency. Material shipped in error by GSA is subject to the provisions of the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101&#x2013;26.8). Credit for material ordered in error will be based on the selling price billed the agency at the time shipment was made to the agency, with the adjustment reflected in current or future billings. Material shall not be returned until appropriate documentation is received from GSA.

(a) The return of material by an agency, to correct ordering errors, may be authorized and later accepted by GSA:

(1) The value of the material exceeds $25 per line item based on the selling price billed the customer.

(2) Authorization to return is requested from the GSA Discrepancy Reports Center (6FRB), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131 within 45 calendar days (60 calendar days for overseas points) after receipt of shipment. Requests should always contain a complete explanation of reason(s) for return of the material. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis when GSA is in need of the material and extenuating circumstances precluded earlier submission of the request.

(3) Each item is in “like-new” condition and is identified by a stock number in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog.

(4) Each item is identified with a specific purchase order or requisition number.

(5) The condition of the material is acceptable on inspection by GSA. When it is not acceptable, disposition, without credit, will be made by GSA. However, when the condition is attributable to carrier negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for damages incurred.

(6) The merchandise to be returned will not adversely affect the GSA nationwide inventory situation.

(7) The return transportation costs are not excessive in relation to the cost of the material.

(b) Transportation costs on material specifically authorized for return by a GSA regional office will be paid by the customer activity. Claims against carriers for discrepancies in shipment will also be the responsibility of the customer activity in accordance with the provisions of subpart 101&#x2013;40.7. When appropriate, GSA will prepare initial documentation to support claim actions.

####### § 101-26.311 Frustrated shipments.

(a) At the request of the ordering agency, GSA may authorize diversion or return for credit of any shipment consigned to an overseas destination which, while en route, cannot be continued onward for any reason and for which the consignee or requisitioning agency cannot provide diversion instructions:

(b) Requests to GSA for disposition instructions shall be directed to the GSA office which made the shipment. Data provided by the agency shall include the original requisition document number, purchase order number (if any), supplementary addresses, and present location of the frustrated shipment. In addition, the agency should furnish the Government bill of lading number or commercial bill of lading reference, and the carrier's freight or waybill number.

(c) GSA may direct disposition of such material through any of the means listed below. Disposition instructions will include a determination by GSA as to the responsibility for payment of transportation costs.

(1) Shipment of material to another consignee.

(2) Temporary storage pending further instructions.

(3) Return to GSA stock.

(4) Disposal by agency.

(5) Disposition through other means if deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.

(d) GSA will provide required documentation to accomplish the desired action and will, if appropriate, initiate necessary adjustments in billing.

(e) Frustrated shipments involving other than GSA stock items will be treated in a manner similar to that prescribed in this § 101&#x2013;26.311 on a case by case basis.

###### Subpart 101-26.4 - Federal Supply Schedules [Reserved]

###### Subpart 101-26.5 - GSA Procurement Programs

####### § 101-26.500 Scope and applicability of subpart.

(a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures relating to GSA procurement programs other than the GSA stock and the Federal supply schedule programs. Also excluded are the policies and procedures relating to the procurement of automatic data processing equipment and services set forth in part 101&#x2013;36.

(b) The policies and procedures in this subpart 101&#x2013;26.5 are applicable to executive agencies except as otherwise specifically indicated. Federal agencies other than executive agencies may participate in these programs and are encouraged to do so.

####### § 101-26.501 Purchase of new motor vehicles.

(a) It shall be the policy to procure commercially available motor vehicles, unless other vehicles are specifically required.

(b) New sedans, station wagons, and light trucks (other than those to be used for law enforcement or where other than standard vehicles are required) shall be procured as follows: Sedans, class IB-subcompact or II-compact; station wagons, class I-subcompact or class II compact vehicles, as described in Federal standard No. 122; and light trucks as defined in Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307. (Federal standard Nos. 122, 292, and 307 as used in this section mean the latest editions.)

Requisitions submitted to GSA for motor vehicles shall be in conformance with the requirements of subpart 101&#x2013;38.1.

(1) Standard passenger vehicles as defined in Federal standard No. 122 are considered to be completely equipped for ordinary operation and are subject to the maximum statutory price limitation.

(2) Items (vehicles) included in Federal standard No. 122 other than those listed as standard (basic units) are considered to be equipped with additional systems and equipment for passenger vehicles.

(c) Requisitions submitted to GSA for the acquisition of new passenger vehicles and light trucks under 8500 GVWR (gross vehicle weight rating) shall be in conformance with Pub. L. 94&#x2013;163 and Executive Order 12375.

(d) New trucks and buses shall be requisitioned in accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.501 and the following:

(1) Light trucks shall be in accordance with Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307; and

(2) Medium and heavy trucks and buses, when not procured from standardized buying programs, shall be in accordance with the latest editions of Federal standard No. 794, Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579. Standardized buying programs shall be based on these specifications as appropriate.

(e) Selection of additional systems or equipment in new vehicles shall be made by the requiring agency and shall be based on the need to provide for overall safety, efficiency, economy, and suitability of the vehicle for the purposes intended pursuant to § 101&#x2013;38.104&#x2013;2.

(1) The essentiality of such systems or equipment shall be weighed against the economic factors involved, the potential benefits to be derived therefrom, and the impact on the fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle.

(2) Additional systems or equipment requested to be purchased by GSA will be construed to have been determined essential for the effective operation of the vehicle involved by the agency head or a designee. When systems or equipment other than those listed in Federal standards are requested, these systems or equipment shall be considered and treated as deviations under § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;4(b).

####### § 101-26.501-1 General.

Except as provided for the Department of Defense (DOD) in paragraph (a) of this section, each executive agency shall submit to GSA for procurement its orders for purchase in the United States of all new passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), trucks or truck tractors (FSC 2320), trailers (FSC 2330) van type (with payload of not less than 5,000 nor more than 50,000 pounds), and firetrucks and firefighting trailers (FSC 4210). Specifically included are sedans, station wagons, carryalls, ambulances, buses, and trucks, including trucks with specialized mounted equipment, truck chassis with special purpose bodies, and all van-type trailers (with payload of not less than 5,000 nor more than 50,000 pounds).

(a) DOD shall submit to GSA for procurement its orders for purchase in the United States for all non-tactical vehicles including, but not limited to, commercial-type passenger motor vehicles (FSC 2310), including buses, and trucks and truck tractors (FSC 2320).

(b) When it is determined by the ordering activity that requirements for passenger motor vehicles and trucks indicate the need for procurement by buying activities other than GSA, a request for waiver justifying the procurement shall be submitted in writing to the General Services Administration (FCA), Washington, DC 20406. GSA will notify agencies in writing whether a waiver has been granted. Justification may be based on the urgency of need or the fact that the vehicle has unique characteristics, such as special purpose body or equipment, requiring the agency personnel to closely supervise installation of the equipment by the contractor; e.g., when a medical van is to be equipped with Government- or contractor-supplied equipment. Requests for procurement through sources other than GSA will be handled on an individual basis provided full justification is submitted therefore.

(c) When it is determined by GSA that procurement of an individual agency requirement by GSA would offer no advantage over local purchase of the item, GSA may grant the ordering activity authority for local purchase. When such a determination is made, the order will be returned to the ordering agency with written authority for local purchase.

####### § 101-26.501-2 Standardized buying programs.

Wherever practical, requirements for motor vehicles will be satisfied under existing standardized buying programs (Indefinite Quantity, Requirements, Federal Supply Schedule contracts). Agencies not familiar with these programs, or seeking additional information about them, are encouraged to contact the GSA Automotive Commodity Center prior to submitting their orders.

(a) Requirements contracts are in place or anticipated to be in place for the following types of standard motor vehicles:

(1) Medium and heavy trucks:

(i) 4 &#xD7; 2 and 6 &#xD7; 4 cab-chassis, stake, van, dump, and truck-tractor; 19,000 to 60,000 pounds GVWR.

(ii) 4 &#xD7; 4 and 6 &#xD7; 4 cab-chassis, stake, dump, and truck-tractor; 26,000 to 52,000 pounds GVWR.

(iii) 1,200 and 2,000 gallon fuel servicing vehicles; and 2,000 gallon aircraft refueler.

(2) Ambulances (in accordance with Federal Specification No. KKK-A-1822): Type I, modular body on cab-chassis; Type II, van body with raised roof; Type III, modular body on van cutaway chassis.

(3) Buses and mini-buses, including school buses:

(i) 32 to 44 adult passenger; 48 to 66 school age passenger.

(ii) 12 to 28 adult passenger; 24 to 42 school age passenger.

(4) Sedans and station wagons (based on standardized, consolidated requirements).

(5) Certain types of light trucks (e.g., conventional carryall, maintenance telephone utility); requirements contracts are established to cover as many types of light trucks as feasible.

(b) Federal Supply Schedule contracts are available to cover certain special purpose motor vehicles, such as firefighting trucks, waste disposal trucks, and construction equipment.

####### § 101-26.501-3 Consolidated purchase program.

(a) Except as noted in § 101&#x2013;26.501(a) and where motor vehicle requirements can not be satisfied under the standardized buying programs described in § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;2, GSA will continue to make consolidated procurements of all motor vehicle types each year to achieve maximum benefits and economies, as follows:

(1) Family buys&#x2014;Large annual consolidated buys for sedans, station wagons, and standard light trucks, purchased in the aggregate by group to the extent practical. These procurements are designed to obtain the best market prices available and are normally definite quantity type with maximum option potential. It is anticipated that resulting contracts will remain in place from approximately mid-November to approximately May 1 (or end of model year closeout).

(2) Two (2) volume procurements each year for light trucks of the types covered by Federal standard Nos. 292 and 307, but not covered by standardized buying programs or family buys, as previously described. Requisitions to be included under these two procurements should reach the GSA Automotive Commodity Center by June 15 and December 1 respectively.

(3) Up to three (3) consolidated procurements for medium and heavy trucks and buses of the types covered by Federal standard No. 794, Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579.

(b) Requirements not covered by Federal standards 122, 292, 307, or 794 shall conform with the provisions of § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;4.

####### § 101-26.501-4 Submission of orders.

Orders for all motor vehicles shall be submitted on GSA Form 1781, Motor Vehicle Requisition, or DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), to the General Services Administration, Automotive Commodity Center (FCA), Washington, DC 20406, and shall contain required FEDSTRIP data for mechanized processing. The Department of Defense shall ensure that appropriate MILSTRIP data are entered on DD Form 448.

(a) Requisitions covering vehicle types not included in Federal standard Nos. 122, 292, 307, or 794, in a military specification, or in an agency specification on file with GSA, shall contain complete descriptions of the vehicles required, the intended use of the vehicles, and terrain in which the vehicles will be used.

(b) Requisitions for vehicles within the category of Federal standard Nos. 122, 292, 307, or 794, but for which deviations from such standards are required, unless already waived by the Director, Automotive Commodity Center (FCA), Federal Supply Service, GSA, Washington, DC 20406, shall include with the requisition a justification supporting each deviation from the standards and shall contain a statement of the intended use of the vehicles, including a description of the terrain in which the vehicles will be used. Prior approval of deviations shall be indicated on the requisitions by citing the waiver authorization number.

(c) GSA Form 1781, Motor Vehicle Requisition, has been specifically designed for agency use to expedite ordering of all vehicles. Agencies are requested to use GSA Form 1781 as a single-line-item requisition for nonstandard as well as standard vehicles. When ordering standard vehicles, the appropriate standard item number for such vehicles equipped to meet specific operational needs may be selected from the applicable table in the Federal standards. Additional systems and equipment may be added by inserting in the “Option Codes” portion of the form the appropriate code for the selected items from the table of options in the standard. When ordering nonstandard vehicles or options, the instructions on the reverse of GSA Form 1781, properly completed, will satisfy the requirements regarding the submission of requisitions as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) Each requisition shall indicate the appropriation fund code to be charged and must bear the original signature of an officer authorized to obligate cited funds.

(e) Separate requisitions shall be submitted for each vehicle type and consignee.

####### § 101-26.501-5 Procurement time schedules.

(a) Requisitions covering vehicle types included in Federal standard Nos. 122, 292, 307, 794, Federal specification Nos. KKK-T-2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, and Federal specification No. KKK-B-1579 will be procured either under a standardized buying program, as described in § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;2, or a consolidated purchase program, as described in § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;3, unless a statement is included justifying the need for delivery other than the delivery times indicated in this section. Requisitions containing a statement of justification will be handled on an emergency basis in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;5(b).

(b)Emergency requirements will receive special handling only when the requisitions are accompanied by adequate justification for individual purchase action. Every effort will be made to meet the delivery date specified in the requisition.

(c)Delivery times for motor vehicle requirements will range widely depending on method of purchase.

(1)Delivery times for motor vehicle requirements submitted and placed against existing in-place contracts (family buy option, requirements contract or Federal Supply Schedule contract) will range from 60 to 150 days from date of purchase order.

(2)Delivery times for motor vehicle requirements submitted for volume consolidated purchases will range from 210 to 330 days after solicitation consolidation date. Included in delivery time estimates are 90 to 105 days required for soliciting and receiving offers, 30 to 60 days for evaluation and award of contracts, 90 to 180 days from date of award for delivery of vehicles to destination (dealer or consignee, as applicable).

(3) For buses, ambulances, and other special duty vehicles which can not be procured under the standardized buying programs or consolidated purchase programs described in §§ 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;2 and 101&#x2013;26.501&#x2013;3, 240 to 270 days from date of award are usually required to effect delivery. However, special purpose vehicles with unique characteristics, such as certain types of firetrucks, may require longer delivery. In such instances, every effort will be made by GSA to facilitate deliveries and keep the requisitioning agencies informed of any unauthorized delay.

####### § 101-26.501-6 Forms used in connection with delivery of vehicles.

(a)This form is used by the contractor to indicate that preshipment inspection and servicing of each vehicle has been performed. The contractor is required to complete GSA Form 1398 (illustrated at § 101&#x2013;26.4902&#x2013;1398) and affix it, preferably, to the lock face or door frame of the right front door after the final inspection. The form should be left in place during the warranty period to permit prompt identification of vehicles requiring dealer repairs pursuant to the warranty.

(b)GSA is constantly striving to improve customer service and the quality of motor vehicles for which it contracts. To inform contractors of the deficiencies noted during the life of the vehicles, Standard Form 368 shall be prepared by the consignee and sent to GSA describing details of vehicle deficiency and action taken for correction. Procedures for documenting and reporting quality deficiencies are set forth in the GSA Publication “Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material or Billings.” Agencies are urged to report all deficiencies to GSA irrespective of satisfactory corrective action taken by the manufacturer's authorized dealer. If the dealer refuses to take corrective action on any vehicle within its warranty period, the report shall so state and include an explanation of circumstances. Standard Form 368 shall also be used to report all noncompliance with specifications or other requirements of the purchase order.

(c)This information is printed on the reverse of the consignee copy of the delivery order. Personnel responsible for receipt and operation of Government motor vehicles should be familiar with the instructions and information contained in the document entitled “Instructions to Consignee Receiving New Motor Vehicles Purchased by General Services Administration.”

####### § 101-26.501-7 Sale of vehicles.

GSA will not solicit trade-in bids when purchasing new motor vehicles for replacement purposes because experience has shown that suppliers (manufacturers) are unwilling to accept used vehicles in part payment for new ones. Accordingly, used vehicles that are being replaced will be disposed of by sale as set forth in Part 101&#x2013;46.

####### § 101-26.501-8 [Reserved]

####### § 101-26.501-9 Centralized motor vehicle leasing program.

GSA has a centralized leasing program to provide an additional source of motor vehicle support to all Federal agencies. This program relieves Federal agencies that use it from both the time constraints and administrative costs associated with independently entering into lease contracts. The centralized leasing program covers subcompact, compact, and midsize sedans, station wagons, and certain types of light trucks (pickups and vans). Participation in the centralized leasing program is mandatory on all executive agencies of the Federal Government (excluding the Department of Defense and the U.S. Postal Service) within the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC. However, agencies must obtain GSA authorization to lease in accordance with § 101&#x2013;39.205 prior to using these established mandatory use contracts. For further information on existing contracts, including vehicles covered, rates, and terms and conditions of the contract(s), contact General Services Administration (FCA), Washington, DC 20406.

Any changes in the scope of the project requested by the requisitioning agency prior to its completion may require a revision in the amount of the reimbursable charges and the time schedule for completion.

####### § 101-26.507 Security equipment.

Federal agencies and other activities authorized to purchase security equipment through GSA sources shall do so in accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.507. Under section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 481), the Administrator of GSA has determined that fixed-price contractors and lower tier subcontractors who are required to protect and maintain custody of security classified records and information may purchase security equipment from GSA sources. Delivery orders for security equipment submitted by such contractors and lower tier subcontractors shall contain a statement that the security equipment is needed for housing Government security classified information and that the purchase of such equipment is required to comply with the security provision of a Government contract. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the delivery order and those of the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern. Security equipment shall be used as prescribed by the cognizant security office.

####### § 101-26.507-1 Submission of requisitions.

Requisitions for security equipment covered by the latest edition of Federal specifications AA-F-357, AA-F-358, AA-F-363, AA-S-1518, and AA-D-600, and interim Federal specifications AA-F-00364 and AA-C-001697 shall be submitted in FEDSTRIP format to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located. GSA will consolidate requisitions for these items from all regions for procurement on a definite quantity basis.

####### § 101-26.507-2 Procurement time schedule.

Requisitions for security equipment will be consolidated by GSA on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year. The consolidated requisitions will be used in executing definite quantity contracts. To ensure inclusion in the invitation for bids, requisitions shall be submitted to GSA on or before January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1 as appropriate. Requisitions received after any of these dates normally will be carried over to the subsequent consolidation date. Approximately 180 calendar days following the consolidation dates should be allowed for initial delivery. Requisitions shall include a required delivery date which reflects anticipated receipt under the time schedule.

####### § 101-26.507-3 Purchase of security equipment from Federal Supply Schedules.

To ensure that a readily available source exists to meet the unforeseen demands for security equipment, Federal Supply Schedule contracts have been established to satisfy requirements that are not appropriate for consolidated procurement and do not exceed the maximum order limitations.

####### § 101-26.507-4 Quantities in excess of the maximum order limitation.

Quantities exceeding the maximum order limitation on Federal Supply Schedules will also be consolidated and procured by GSA pursuant to § 101&#x2013;26.507&#x2013;2. Where quantities are required to be delivered before the time frames established for the quarterly consolidated procurement, the requisition must indicate the earlier required delivery. As necessary, separate procurement action will be taken by GSA to satisfy the requirements.

####### § 101-26.508 Electronic data processing (EDP) tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band).

Procurement by Federal agencies of EDP tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band) shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.508.

Federal agencies located within the 48 contiguous United States, Washington, DC and Hawaii (applicable to EDP tape only for Hawaii) shall procure these tapes in accordance with the provisions of the current schedules and this § 101&#x2013;26.508&#x2013;1. Orders not exceeding the maximum order limitations of the Federal Supply Schedules and prepared directly by activities located outside the geographical areas referenced above shall, to the extent possible, be consolidated and submitted in FEDSTRIP format to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located.

####### § 101-26.508-2 Requisitioning data processing tape not available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts.

(a) Requisitions for types of EDP tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band) covered by Federal Supply Schedule contracts which exceed the maximum order limitations of the schedule shall be submitted to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located.

(b) Requisitions for all types of EDP tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band) not covered by Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to GSA for purchase action when the dollar value of the requisitions exceeds, or is estimated to exceed, $2,500 for EDP tape and $5,000 for instrumentation tape. However, regardless of the amount involved (including requisitions estimated to be less than the dollar limitations referenced above), purchase action shall not be taken by GSA or an agency unless a waiver of the requirement for using items of tape available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts has been furnished in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;2.

(c) When establishing required delivery dates in purchase requests submitted in accordance with this § 101&#x2013;26.508&#x2013;2, agencies should normally allow 105 days leadtime to permit orderly procurement by GSA. In addition to this 105 days leadtime, inspection and testing of the tape requires approximately 15 days.

(d) When an agency submitting a purchase request in accordance with this § 101&#x2013;26.508&#x2013;2 has a need for scheduled deliveries, minimum or maximum order quantities, or other special arrangements, GSA will develop specific provisions to accommodate the needs. The provisions will be based on information furnished by the agency concerned and will be included in solicitations for offers and resultant contracts.

####### § 101-26.508-3 Consolidation of requisitions.

To the maximum extent feasible, agencies shall develop procedures which will permit planned consolidated requisitioning of EDP tape and instrumentation tape (wide and intermediate band) on an agencywide basis. When agencywide consolidation is not feasible, consideration shall be given to the consolidation of individual requisitions for small quantities at any agency level. This will enable the Government to benefit from lower prices generally obtainable through large volume procurements.

####### § 101-26.509 Tabulating machine cards.

Procurement by Federal agencies of tabulating machine cards shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.509.

Federal agencies shall procure these cards in accordance with the provisions of the current schedule. Orders not exceeding the maximum order limitation of the Federal Supply Schedule and prepared directly by activities located outside the geographical delivery areas specified in the schedule shall be submitted in FEDSTRIP format to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located.

####### § 101-26.509-2 Requisitioning tabulating machine cards not available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts.

(a) Requisitions for tabulating machine cards covered by Federal Supply Schedule contracts which exceed the maximum order limitation of the schedule shall be forwarded in FEDSTRIP format to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located.

(b) Requisitions for tabulating machine cards not covered by Federal Supply Schedule contracts shall be submitted to GSA for purchase action if the dollar value of the cards exceeds or is estimated to exceed $2,500. However, regardless of the amount involved (including requisitions estimated to be $2,500 or less), purchase action shall not be taken by GSA or an agency unless a waiver of the requirement for the use of tabulating cards available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts has been furnished in accordance with § 101&#x2013;26.100&#x2013;2. Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service (F), General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20406. The requests shall fully describe the items required and state the reasons the tabulating machine cards covered by the Federal Supply Schedule contracts will not adequately serve the end-use purpose. GSA will notify the requesting agency in writing of the action taken on the waiver request. To reduce leadtime, requisitions may be submitted in FEDSTRIP format with the requests for waivers. A requisition for items for which a waiver has first been obtained shall be submitted with a copy of the waiver to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located. GSA will either arrange for procurement of the items or authorize the requesting activity to procure them.

(c) Purchase requests with established delivery dates should allow sufficient leadtime (see § 101&#x2013;26.102&#x2013;3) to permit orderly procurement by GSA, including acceptance testing and delivery to destination.

(d) In those instances where an agency anticipates a need for scheduled deliveries, minimum or maximum order quantities, or other special arrangements, GSA will develop specific provisions to accommodate the needs of the particular agency. These provisions will be based on information furnished by the agency concerned for inclusion in solicitations for offers and resultant contracts.

####### § 101-26.509-3 Consolidation of requisitions.

To the maximum extent feasible, agencies shall consolidate their requisitions for tabulating machine cards on an agencywide basis. If agencywide consolidation is not feasible, consideration shall be given to the consolidation of requisitions at any agency level when the Government will benefit from lower prices through large-volume procurement.

####### § 101-26.801 Applicability.

This subpart is applicable to all civilian executive agencies, including their contractors and subcontractors when authorized. DOD activities should follow the applicable DOD or military service/agency regulations in reporting discrepancies or deficiencies in shipments or material, or requesting adjustments in billings from or directed by GSA unless exempted therefrom, in which case the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;26.801 apply.

####### § 101-26.802 Exclusions.

The provisions of this regulation are not applicable to shipments and billings related to the stockpile of strategic and critical materials or excess or surplus property; or to billings for services, space, communications, and printing.

####### § 101-26.803 Discrepancies or deficiencies in shipments, material, or billings.

####### § 101-26.803-1 Reporting discrepancies or deficiencies.

Discrepancies or deficiencies in shipments or material occur in four broad categories: Quality deficiencies, shipping discrepancies, transportation discrepancies, and billing discrepancies. When discrepancies or deficiencies occur, activities shall document them with sufficient information to enable initiation and processing of claims against suppliers and carriers. Procedures for documenting discrepancies or deficiencies are set forth in the GSA publication, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings, issued by the Federal Supply Service, GSA. Copies of the publication may be obtained by submitting a completed GSA Form 457, FSS Publications Mailing List Application, (referencing mailing list code number ODDH&#x2013;0001) to the following address: General Services Administration, Centralized Mailing List Service (CMLS-C), 819 Taylor Street, P.O. Box 17077, Fort Worth, TX 76102&#x2013;0077.

####### § 101-26.803-2 Reporting quality deficiencies.

(a) Quality deficiencies are defined as defects or nonconforming conditions which limit or prohibit the item received from fulfilling its intended purpose. Quality deficiencies include deficiencies in design, specification, material, manufacturing, and workmanship. Timely reporting of all quality deficiencies is essential to maintain an acceptable quality level for common-use items. GSA relies on agency reporting of quality deficiencies in order to act to remove the defective items from the supply system as well as to document contractor performance files for use in future procurements.

(b) A product deficiency which may cause death, injury, or severe occupational illness, or directly restrict the mission capabilities of the using organization, is called a “category I” complaint. Quality complaints that do not meet the category I criteria are called “category II” complaints. Standard Form (SF) 368, Quality Deficiency Report, or a message in the format of the Standard Form 368, is used to report quality deficiencies.

(c) Standard Form 368 (including SF's 368 submitted in message formats) are required for all product quality deficiencies that involve material (1) shipped to the user from a GSA distribution center (including shipments made directly to the user from GSA distribution centers as well as “indirect” shipments (shipments with intermediate stops between the GSA distribution center and the ultimate user)), (2) shipped to the user from a DOD depot or another Government activity, as directed by GSA, (3) purchased by GSA for the user and inspected by GSA, or (4) ordered from a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract which specified source inspection by GSA.

(d) Category I complaints are to be reported to GSA by telephone or telegraphic message within 72 hours of discovery. Category II complaints are to be reported within 15 days after discovery.

(e) Standard Forms 368 (in triplicate) should be sent to the following address: GSA Discrepancy Reports Centers (6 FR-Q), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131&#x2013;3088. Communications routing indicator: RUEVFXE (unclassified), RULSSAA (classified), Com: (816) 926&#x2013;7447, FTS: 926&#x2013;7447, AUTOVON: 465&#x2013;7447.

(f) For defective items covered by a manufacturer's commercial warranty, activities should initially attempt to resolve all complaints on these items themselves (examples of items with a commercial warranty are vehicles, major appliances such as gas and electric ranges, washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators). If the contractor replaces or corrects the deficiency, an SF 368, in triplicate, should be sent to the Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address. The resolution of the case should be clearly stated in the text of the SF 368.

(g) If, however, the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace, either a defective item or an aspect of service under the warranty, an SF 368, along with copies of all pertinent correspondence, should be forwarded to the GSA office executing the contract (address will be contained in the pertinent contract/purchase order). An information copy of the SF 368 should also be submitted to the Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address.

(h) For items ordered from a GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract when the inspection is performed by an activity other than GSA or when the items are purchased by GSA for the user but not inspected by GSA, activities should initially attempt to resolve all complaints on these items directly with the contractor. If the contractor refuses to correct, or fails to replace a defective item, an SF 368, along with copies of all correspondence, should be forwarded to the GSA office executing the contract (address will be contained in the pertinent contract/purchase order). An information copy of the SF 368 should also be submitted to the Discrepancy Reports Center at the above address.

(i) Information submitted to the Discrepancy Reports Center regarding defective items will be maintained as a quality history file for use in future procurements.

(j) Additional information regarding reporting of quality deficiences may be obtained by referring to chapter 4 of the GSA publication cited in § 101&#x2013;26.803&#x2013;1.

####### § 101-26.803-3 Reporting of discrepancies in transportation, shipments, material, or billings.

(a) Transportation-type discrepancies shall be processed under the instructions in subpart 101&#x2013;40.7 when the discrepancies are the fault of the carrier and occur while the shipments are in the possession of:

(1) International ocean or air carriers, regardless of who pays the transportation charges, except when shipment is on a through Government bill of lading (TGBL), or is made through the Defense Transportation System (DTS). Discrepancies in shipments on a TGBL or which occur while in the DTS shall be reported as prescribed in the GSA publication referenced in § 101&#x2013;26.803&#x2013;1; or

(2) Carriers within the continental United States, when other than GSA or DOD pays the transportation charges.

(b) All other shipping, transportation, or billing discrepancies shall be reported on the forms, and within the time frames, dollar limitations, and according to the procedures prescribed in the GSA publication referenced in § 101&#x2013;26.803&#x2013;1.

####### § 101-26.803-4 Adjustments.

GSA and DOD will adjust billings resulting from over or under charges, or discrepancies or deficiencies in shipments, or material on a bill submitted under the provisions of this subpart 101&#x2013;26.8 and the GSA publication referenced in § 101&#x2013;26.803&#x2013;1.

##### PART 101-27 - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

###### Subpart 101-27.1 - Stock Replenishment

####### § 101-27.101 General.

Each agency shall establish and maintain such control of personal property inventories as will assure that the total cost involved will be kept to the minimum consistent with program needs. For purposes of stock replenishment, inventories may be considered to be composed of active inventory which is that portion carried to satisfy average expected demand, and safety stock which is that portion carried for protection against stock depletion occurring when demand exceeds average expected demand, or when leadtime is greater than anticipated.

(a) In establishing active inventory levels, consideration shall be given to the average demand of individual items, space availability, procurement costs, inventory carrying costs, purchase prices, quantity discounts, transportation costs, other pertinent costs, and statutory and budgetary limitations.

(b) In establishing safety stock levels, consideration shall be given to demand and leadtime fluctuations, essentiality of items, and the additional costs required to achieve additional availability.

####### § 101-27.102 Economic order quantity principle.

The economic order quantity (EOQ) principle is a means for achieving economical inventory management. Application of the EOQ principle reduces total variable costs of procurement and possession to a minimum.

####### § 101-27.102-1 Applicability.

All executive agencies, except the Department of Defense, within the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, shall replenish inventories of stock items having recurring demands, except items held at points of final use, in accordance with the economic order quantity (EOQ) principle.

####### § 101-27.102-2 Guidelines.

Guidelines for implementing the EOQ principle of stock replenishment are in the GSA Handbook, The Economic Order Quantity Principle and Applications, issued by the Federal Supply Service, GSA. The handbook is identified under national stock number 7610&#x2013;00&#x2013;543&#x2013;6765 in the GSA Supply Catalog, and copies may be obtained by agencies in the same manner as other items in that catalog. The public may purchase the handbook from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

####### § 101-27.102-3 Limitations on use.

(a) When there are no limiting factors which preclude its application, such as space or budgetary limitations, the basic EOQ techniques shall be used.

(b) When a space, personnel, or budgetary limitation precludes application of the basic EOQ technique, a modification of the technique may be made provided the modification produces:

(1) The fewest possible replenishments for a given level of inventory investment; or

(2) The lowest possible level of inventory investment for a given number of replenishments.

(c) When quantity purchase discounts or volume transportation rates will produce savings greater than the increased variable costs involved in procurement and possession, the economic purchase quantity (EPQ) principle shall be used as described in the GSA Handbook. The Economic Order Quantity Principle and Applications.

####### § 101-27.103 Acquisition of excess property.

Except for inventories eligible for return to GSA for credit pursuant to the provisions of § 101&#x2013;27.501 and for inventories for which an economic retention limit has been established in accordance with the provisions of subpart 101&#x2013;27.3 of this part, inventory levels may be adjusted upward when items of stock are to be acquired from excess sources. Such adjustments should be tempered by caution and arrived at after careful consideration. Generally, acquisitions of items for inventory from excess sources shall not exceed a 2-year supply except when:

(a) A greater quantity is needed to meet known requirements for an authorized planned program.

(b) The item is not available without special manufacture and a predictable requirement exists.

(c) Administrative determination has been made that in application of the EOQ principle of stock replenishment within an agency an inventory level in excess of 2 years is appropriate for low dollar-volume items.

(d) The items are being transferred into authorized stock funds for resale to other Government agencies.

###### Subpart 101-27.2 - Management of Shelf-Life Materials

####### § 101-27.201 Scope of subpart.

This subpart provides for the identification, designation of useful life, and establishment of controls for shelf-life items to minimize loss and insure maximum use prior to deterioration. A shelf-life item is any item possessing deteriorative or unstable characteristics to the degree that a storage period must be assigned to assure the issuance of material that will perform satisfactorily in service.

####### § 101-27.202 Applicability.

This subpart 101&#x2013;27.2 is applicable to all executive agencies except the Department of Defense. The principles and objectives prescribed in this subpart are in consonance with those adopted by the Department of Defense in the establishment of shelf-life procedures for use by military activities.

####### § 101-27.203 Program objectives.

In order to assure maximum use of shelf-life items, each executive agency shall:

(a) Identify shelf-life items, including any new items to be placed in inventory, which have a limited shelf-life period.

(b) Establish the shelf-life period of such items and procedures for controlling their procurement, storage, and issue.

(c) Inspect or test certain shelf-life items prior to deterioration to determine if the shelf-life period can be extended.

(d) Conduct inventory management analyses to determine if shelf-life stocks are expected to be utilized prior to the expiration of the original or any extended shelf-life period, and, if not, arrange for transfer of such stock in sufficient time to permit usage prior to deterioration.

(e) Make available for Government-wide distribution, through excess property channels, any stocks which cannot be utilized through normal supply channels.

####### § 101-27.204 Types of shelf-life items.

Shelf-life items are classified as nonextendable (Type I) and extendable (Type II). Type I items have a definite storage life after which the item or material is considered to be no longer usable for its primary function and should be discarded. Type II items are those for which successive reinspection dates can be established when the items have a continued usability as determined by examination based upon criteria that have been agreed upon. Examples of Type I items are drugs and medicines with certain characteristics. Examples of Type II items are paint and ink.

####### § 101-27.205 Shelf-life codes.

Shelf-life items shall be identified by use of a one-digit code to provide for uniform coding of shelf-life materials by all agencies.

(a) The code designators for shelf-life periods of up to 60 months are as follows:

(b) Code designator 0 is used to identify items not included in a shelf-life program.

(c) Code designator X shall be used to identify critical end-use items, military essential items, and medical items with a shelf life greater than 60 months. Agencies shall establish controls for such materials to prevent issuance of any unserviceable items.

(d) Agencies may also establish controls for materials with a shelf life greater than 60 months that are not identified in paragraph (c) of this section. Such controls should be established only when they are necessary for effective management of the items.

####### § 101-27.206 Procurement of shelf-life materials.

####### § 101-27.206-1 General considerations.

In determining requirements for shelf-life items, the following elements should be taken into consideration:

(a) Assigned storage time periods; and

(b) Appropriate contracting techniques for the particular item involved, including specification requirements, industry practices, and storage and delivery procedures.

####### § 101-27.206-2 Identification and shipping requirements.

Manufacturers shall, whenever practicable, be required to mark the unit or container with the month and year of manufacture or production and the batch number on all shelf-life items (60 months or less) procured from other than GSA sources. Whenever practical, the supplier shall be required to ship or deliver material within a given number of months from the date of manufacture or production. These “age on delivery” requirements should not be imposed in such a manner as to unduly restrict competition at any trade level. The following guidelines are suggested as appropriate for most shelf-life items:

####### § 101-27.206-3 Packaging.

To the extent feasible and economical, shelf-life material shall be packaged in such a way as to provide for minimum deterioration.

####### § 101-27.207 Control and inspection.

####### § 101-27.207-1 Agency controls.

Agencies shall establish the necessary controls to identify shelf-life items on their stock records (and in other appropriate elements of their supply system), and shall determine the appropriate shelf life for other than GSA managed items. Shelf-life items shall be stored in such a way as to ensure that the oldest stock on hand is issued first. Agencies shall issue the oldest stock of shelf-life items first except when it is not feasible as in shipments to overseas activities.

####### § 101-27.207-2 Inspection.

Type II items remaining in stock immediately before the end of the designated shelf-life period shall be inspected to determine whether the shelf life can be extended, except items having a line item inventory value of $300 or less, or if the cost of inspection or testing is significant in relation to the value of the item. If the material is found suitable for issue on the date of inspection, the shelf life should be extended for a period equal to 50 percent of the original shelf-life period and the next reinspection date established accordingly. Material should be reinspected before the end of each extended shelf-life period and the shelf life extended again up to 50 percent of the original shelf life as long as the material conforms to the established criteria. Material on which the shelf life has been extended shall not be shipped to overseas activities if the time remaining in the extended shelf-life period is relatively short.

####### § 101-27.207-3 Marking material to show extended shelf life.

When the shelf-life period of Type II material (except for critical end-use items as described below) is extended, only the exterior containers of bulk stocks need be annotated or labeled to indicate the date of inspection and date material is to be reinspected. Individual units of issue not classified as having a critical end-use application are not required to be annotated or labeled as long as controls are established to preclude issuance of unserviceable material to a user. (A critical end-use item is any item which is essential to the preservation of life in emergencies; e.g., parachutes, marine life preservers, and certain drug products, or any item which is essential to the performance of a major system; e.g., aircraft, the failure of which would cause damage to the system or endanger personnel.) At the time of shipment, the date of inspection and date for reinspection shall be affixed by label or marked by other means on each unit of issue of Type II items having a critical end-use application.

####### § 101-27.208 Inventory analyses.

(a) An inventory analysis shall be conducted periodically for each Type I item to determine whether the quantity on hand will be used within the established shelf-life period. If the analysis indicates there are quantities which will not be used within the shelf-life period, arrangements shall be made to ensure use of the item(s) within the holding agency or for redistribution to other agencies.

(b) An inventory analysis shall be conducted periodically for each Type II item with a shelf life of 60 months or less to determine whether issue of the quantity on hand is anticipated prior to the expiration of the designated shelf life. This analysis shall be made as follows:

(1) If the analysis indicates that the quantity on hand will not be issued within the shelf-life period and the cost of inspection or testing is not significant in relation to the line item value, the items shall be inspected to determine if the shelf-life period can be extended.

(2) If the analysis indicates that the quantity on hand will be issued within the shelf-life period, inspection is not required. However, such items shall be viewed again during the last month of the shelf-life period to determine whether quantities are sufficient to warrant inspection. The guidelines in § 101&#x2013;27.207&#x2013;2 shall be used to determine whether quantities are sufficient to warrant inspection and for extending the shelf-life period.

(3) If an agency does not have an inspection capability and the quantity and value of an indicated overage is sufficiently large to warrant special consideration, arrangements shall be made for qualified inspection or laboratory testing to determine whether the material is suitable for issue.

####### § 101-27.209 Utilization and distribution of shelf-life items.

Where it is determined that specified quantities of both Type I and Type II shelf-life items will not be used within the shelf-life period, such quantities shall be utilized or distributed in accordance with this section.

####### § 101-27.209-1 GSA stock items.

Shelf-life items that meet the criteria for return under the provisions of subpart 101&#x2013;27.5 of this part may be offered for return to GSA.

####### § 101-27.209-2 Items to be reported as excess.

Shelf-life items which do not meet the criteria in subpart 101&#x2013;27.5 of this part, which would, if returned to GSA, adversely affect the GSA nationwide stock position, or which are returned to GSA and are determined unsuitable for issue, will be reported as excess under the provisions of part 101&#x2013;43 of this chapter.

####### § 101-27.209-3 Disposition of unneeded property.

If no transfer is effected and no donation requested, the property shall be assigned for sale, abandonment, or destruction in accordance with part 101&#x2013;45 of this chapter.

###### Subpart 101-27.3 - Maximizing Use of Inventories

####### § 101-27.300 Scope.

This subpart prescribes policy and procedures to assure maximum use of inventories based upon recognized economic limitations.

####### § 101-27.301 [Reserved]

####### § 101-27.302 Applicability.

The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all civil executive agencies.

####### § 101-27.303 Reducing long supply.

Through effective interagency matching of material and requirements before the material becomes excess, unnecessary procurements and investment losses can be reduced. Timely action is required to reduce inventories to their normal stock levels by curtailing procurement and by utilizing and redistributing long supply. (The termmeans the increment of inventory of an item that exceeds the stock level criteria established for that item by the inventory manager, but excludes quantities to be declared excess.) In this connection, requirements for agency managed items should be obtained from long supply inventories offered by agencies rather than by procurement from commercial sources. Because supply requirements usually fluctuate over a period of time, a long supply quantity which is 10 percent or less of the total stock of the item is considered marginal and need not be reduced.

####### § 101-27.303-1 Cancellation or transfer.

When the long supply of an item, including quantities due in from procurement, is greater than 10 percent of the total stock of that item, the inventory manager, or other appropriate official, shall cancel or curtail any outstanding requisitions or procurements on which award has not been made for such items, and may also cancel contracts for such items (if penalty charges would not be incurred) or transfer the long supply, if economical, to other offices within the agency in accordance with agency utilization procedures. In such cases, acquisition of long supply items shall not be made from other sources such as requirements contracts.

####### § 101-27.303-2 Redistribution.

If the long supply of an item remains greater than 10 percent of the total stock of an item despite efforts to cancel or transfer the long supply as provided in § 101&#x2013;27.303&#x2013;1, the inventory manager shall offer the long supply to another agency or other agencies in accordance with this § 101&#x2013;27.303&#x2013;2. Before offering a long supply to any agency, the inventory manager shall determine whether the item to be offered is a centrally managed item or an agency managed item. A centrally managed item is an item of supply or equipment which forms part of an inventory of an agency performing a mission of storage and distribution to other Government activities; e.g., GSA and DSA. An agency managed item is a procured item that forms a part of a controlled inventory of an agency and its activities for issue internally for its own use. After determining whether the item to be offered is an agency or centrally managed item, the inventory manager shall:

(a) Offer centrally managed items to the agency managing the item for return and credit in accordance with the procedures established by that agency; and

(b) Offer agency managed items to other agencies which manage the same item. Reimbursement shall be arranged by the agencies effecting the inventory transfer. The responsibility of locating agencies or activities requiring these items shall rest with the agency holding the long supply. However, agencies may receive a list of Government activities using particular national stock numbers by writing to the General Services Administration (FFL), Washington, DC 20406.

####### § 101-27.304 Criteria for economic retention limits.

If a long supply continues to exceed 10 percent of the total stock of an item despite efforts to redistribute the long supply as provided in § 101&#x2013;27.303&#x2013;2, the inventory manager shall establish an economic retention limit for the item in accordance with the provisions of this § 101&#x2013;27.304. An economic retention limit is the maximum quantity of an item that can be held in stock without incurring greater costs for carrying the stock than the costs for disposal and resulting loss of investment. The economic retention limit shall be used to determine which portion of the inventory may be economically retained and which portion should be disposed of as excess.

####### § 101-27.304-1 Establishment of economic retention limit.

An economic retention limit must be established for inventories so that the Government will not incur any more than the minimum necessary costs to provide stock of an item at the time it is required. Generally, it would be more economical to dispose of stock in excess of the limit and procure stock again at a future time when the need is more proximate rather than incur the cumulative carrying costs.

(a) The agency managing a centrally managed or agency managed item shall establish an economic retention limit so that the total cumulative cost of carrying a stock of the item (including interest on the capital that is tied up in the accumulated carrying costs) will be no greater than the reacquisition cost of the stock (including the procurement or order cost). Consideration should be given to any significant net return that might be realized from present disposal of the stock. Where no information has been issued, the net return from disposal is assumed to be zero. Guidelines for setting stock retention limits are provided in the following table and explanatory remarks that follow:

(b) The economic retention limit at a user stocking activity can best be determined by the item manager (for centrally managed or agency managed items) on the basis of overall Government requirements and planned procurement. Since stocks in long supply at a user stocking activity are less likely to find utilization outlets, the retention limit at these activities should be relatively small. Generally the economic retention limit at a user stocking activity should be computed in the same manner as in paragraph (a) of this section and then reduced by 70 percent.

####### § 101-27.304-2 Factors affecting the economic retention limit.

(a) The economic retention limit may be increased where:

(1) The item is of special manufacture and relates to an end item of equipment which is expected to be in use beyond the economic retention time limit; or

(2) Costs incident to holding an additional quantity are insignificant and obsolescence and deterioration of an item are unlikely.

(b) The economic retention limit should be reduced under the following conditions:

(1) The related end item of equipment is being phased out or an interchangeable item is available; or

(2) The item has limited storage life, is likely to become obsolete, or the age and condition of the item does not justify the full retention limit.

####### § 101-27.305 Disposition of long supply.

Where efforts to reduce the inventory below the economic retention limit have been unsuccessful, appropriate disposition should be effected in accordance with subpart 101&#x2013;43.3 of this chapter. Any remaining inventory which is within the economic retention limit shall be retained. However, the item shall be reviewed at least annually and efforts made to reduce the long supply inventory in accordance with § 101&#x2013;27.303.

###### Subpart 101-27.4 - Elimination of Items From Inventory

####### § 101-27.400 Scope of subpart.

This subpart establishes policy and procedures designed to assure that items which can be obtained more economically from readily available sources, Government or commercial, are eliminated from inventory. For items which are not readily available from Government or commercial sources or are being held in inventory for a one time construction project, this subpart shall be applied to the extent feasible by the activity managing or controlling such inventories.

####### § 101-27.401 [Reserved]

####### § 101-27.402 Applicability.

The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all executive agencies in connection with inventory items maintained at stocking activities other than Government wholesale supply sources.

####### § 101-27.403 General.

By eliminating inactive items and slow-moving items which are readily available, when needed, from Government wholesale supply activities or from commercial sources, the costs to the Government in inventory investment and for maintaining the items in inventory can be eliminated. An “inactive item” is an item for which no current or future requirements are recognized by previous users and the item manager. A “slow-moving item” is an item for which there are current or future requirements, but the frequency and quantity of such requirements do not make it economical to stock them in lieu of obtaining requirements from other sources when needed. However, “standby or reserve items” are not to be eliminated from inventories. A “standby or reserve item” is an item for which a reserve stock is held so that the items will be available immediately to meet emergencies for which there is insufficient time to procure or requisition the items without endangering life or causing substantial financial loss to the Government.

####### § 101-27.404 Review of items.

Except for standby or reserve stocks, items in inventory shall be reviewed periodically (at least annually) to identify those which are inactive and slow-moving. This review may be conducted coincidently with the normal replenishment or long supply reviews. The estimate of current or future requirements for an item shall be based on its recent history of recurring requirements. Standby items shall also be reviewed at appropriate intervals to substantiate their qualification for inclusion in that category.

####### § 101-27.405 Criteria for elimination.

Inactive items, items which no longer qualify as standby, and slow-moving items which are readily available, when needed, from Government or commercial sources shall be eliminated from inventory. The determination of a slow-moving item shall be based on a comparison of the costs for continuing to maintain it in stock as opposed to the costs for ordering it from outside sources each time it is requested. This comparison shall also consider any difference in price and transportation costs for each alternative. In the absence of criteria for stockage of an item developed and used by an agency, the desired results will be obtained through application of the following table:

####### § 101-27.406 Disposition of stock.

Stocks of slow-moving items which are not otherwise determined to be eligible for continued stockage shall be eliminated through normal attrition and shall not be replenished. The successive actions indicated in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, shall be taken, as necessary, to remove stocks of inactive items from inventory.

(a) Transfer stock to other offices where needed within the agency.

(b) Transfer stock to other agencies as follows:

(1) Centrally managed items to the agency managing the item for credit; or

(2) Agency program items to agencies requiring them.

(c) Dispose of remaining stocks, as excess, after actions taken in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in accordance with subpart 101&#x2013;43.3.

###### Subpart 101-27.5 - Return of GSA Stock Items

####### § 101-27.500 Scope and applicability of subpart.

This subpart sets forth policy and procedures for the return to GSA for credit of items which are in long supply or for which no current or future requirements are anticipated. The provisions of this subpart 101&#x2013;27.5 are applicable to all executive agencies. Federal agencies other than executive agencies may participate in this program and are encouraged to do so.

####### § 101-27.501 Eligibility for return.

GSA stock items for which no current or future agency requirements are anticipated are eligible for return to GSA for credit. Despite eligibility for return to GSA, consideration should be given to the transportation costs involved as related to the value of the items, and, where excessive, such items shall not be reported to GSA.

####### § 101-27.502 Criteria for return.

Any GSA stock item to be returned to GSA by an agency which has no current or future requirements for that item shall meet the following conditions:

(a) The minimum dollar value per line item, based on the current GSA selling price, shall be:

(1) $130 for hand tools, FSG 51, and measuring tools, FSG 52; and

(2) $450 for items in all other Federal supply groups and classes except for tires and tubes, FSC 2610; tool kits, FSC 5180; laboratory supplies, FSCs 6630 and 6640; Standard forms, FSC 7540; paints, dopes, varnishes, and related products, FSC 8010; preservatives and sealing compounds, FSC 8030; adhesives, FSC 8040; boxes, cartons, and crates, FSC 8115; and subsistence items, FSG 89, which are not returnable and shall be considered excess, and shall be processed in accordance with part 101&#x2013;43 of this chapter.

(b) The minimum remaining shelf life of this material shall be 12 months at the time of receipt by GSA.

(c) The material shall not be a terminal or discontinued item.

(d) The material shall be in either condition code A or condition code E.

####### § 101-27.503 Allowable credit.

Allowable credit for activities returning material that is accepted by GSA will be reflected in billings by GSA and will be commensurate with the condition of the material received.

(a) Credit will be granted at the rate of 80 percent of the current GSA selling price after acceptance by GSA for new, used, repaired, or reconditioned material which is serviceable and issuable to all agencies without limitation or restriction (condition code A).

(b) Credit will be granted at the rate of 60 percent of the current GSA selling price for items which involve limited expenses or effort to restore to serviceable condition, and which is accomplished in the storage activity where the stock is located (e.g., a deficiency in packing or packaging which restricts the issue or requires repacking or repackaging (condition code E)).

(c) No credit will be given for material returned to GSA which does not meet the above criteria or which was returned to GSA without prior approval.

####### § 101-27.504 Notice to GSA.

When an activity elects to offer material to GSA for credit, the activity shall submit offers in accordance with chapter 4 of the FEDSTRIP Operating Guide or chapter 9 of MILSTRIP (DoD 4000.25&#x2013;1&#x2013;M).

####### § 101-27.505 Notice to activity.

GSA will provide notice to the offering activity of an acceptance/rejection decision for an offer and verification of material receipt for accepted offers.

(a) Within 20 workdays after receipt of an offer to return material, GSA will notify the offering activity of acceptance or rejection of the offer.

(1) For accepted offers, GSA will inform the offering activity of the GSA material return facility (storage activity) to which the material shall be shipped. Prior to shipment of the material authorized by GSA for return, activities shall verify the declared condition. (If the offering activity considers that the transportation costs of sending the material to the GSA material return facility are excessive in relation to the value of the material and withdraws the offers, the GSA region that was designated to receive the offered material shall be notified accordingly.)

(2) For rejected offers, GSA will so inform the activity offering the material and give the reason for nonacceptance.

(b) Upon receipt of material authorized for return by GSA, the offering activity will be provided verification of receipt and a report of any discrepancies. When the discrepant condition is attributable to carrier negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for any damages incurred. A notice of credit will be provided the offering activity through credit entries on the monthly billing statement from the supporting GSA finance center.

(c) When offers of material that have been authorized by GSA for return are withdrawn, offering activities shall report such cancellation to the GSA region that was designated to receive the offered material.

####### § 101-27.506 Determination of acceptability for credit.

Returned material will be examined by GSA upon receipt to determine acceptability for credit. Returned material which is unacceptable for credit will be deemed to have been declared excess by the returning activity, and will be disposed of by GSA as excess or surplus in the name of the activity, in accordance with part 101&#x2013;43 of this chapter. The returning activity will be officially notified of the disposal action taken by GSA.

####### § 101-27.507 Transportation and other costs.

Transportation costs for the movement of material to GSA and handling costs for preparation and shipment shall be paid by the activity shipping the material to GSA.

###### § 101-27.000 Scope of part.

This part provides policies, principles, and guidelines to be used in the management of Government-owned inventories of personal property.

##### PART 101-28 - STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION

###### Subpart 101-28.1 [Reserved]

###### Subpart 101-28.2 - Interagency Cross-Servicing in Storage Activities

####### § 101-28.200 Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes policies and procedures to be followed in the cross-servicing of storage and warehousing services between executive agencies of the Government. It implements the provisions of the cross-servicing agreement between the Department of Defense (DOD) and GSA and extends the provisions of the agreement to provide cross-servicing between the civilian agencies of the Government.

####### § 101-28.201 Applicability.

(a) The policies and procedures established by this subpart 101&#x2013;28.2 are primarily applicable to storage activities within the United States. Executive agencies shall make every effort to utilize available Government storage services of other executive agencies to avoid new construction of storage facilities, acquisition of temporary space, and unnecessary transportation of supplies, material, and equipment to distant storage points. Whenever feasible, the policies and procedures shall be used to cross-service storage and warehousing requirements in overseas storage activities. Available storage services of executive agencies shall be made available for cross-servicing the requirements of other Federal agencies when requested. Other Federal agencies are encouraged to participate in cross-servicing arrangements.

(b) The provisions of this subpart 101&#x2013;28.2 do not apply to ocean terminals, Government storage activities financed under industrial funds, activities concerned with the storage and handling of bulk fuels (petroleum products), and storage functions performed by GSA for the Federal Preparedness Agency.

####### § 101-28.202 GSA/DOD cross-servicing agreement.

An agreement between GSA and DOD has established procedures to be followed in the cross-servicing of storage and warehousing services between Government agencies. Copies of the agreement, containing a listing of minimum services to be provided, responsibilities of agencies operating storage facilities, responsibilities of requesting agencies, and agency contact points to determine storage availability, may be obtained from the General Services Administration (FFN), Washington, DC 20406.

####### § 101-28.202-1 Request for services.

Requests for storage and warehousing services shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the GSA/DOD cross-servicing agreement. Arrangements incident to the furnishing of services, specific limitations, terms, and conditions shall be agreed to directly by the activities concerned.

####### § 101-28.202-2 Cancellation of cross-servicing arrangements.

(a) Accepted requests may be canceled by the requesting agency prior to delivery of supplies, material, and equipment to the storage activity when logistical developments make cancellation necessary or cancellation is in the best interest of the Government. The agency which accepted the request shall be informed of the cancellation in writing as soon as possible.

(b) Cancellation of arrangements in facilities to be inactivated or disposed of by an operating agency may be made as provided for in the GSA/DOD agreement. Also, after supplies, material, and equipment have been received at a storage activity, cancellation may be made when unforeseen emergencies arise which justify such cancellation. Advice of these necessary cancellations shall be in writing to the agency owning the material sufficiently in advance to allow the owning agency the maximum amount of time to make other arrangements for their property.

(c) When a facility in which cross-servicing is being accomplished is to be transferred from an operating agency to another agency, the operating agency shall inform the agency owning the property at least 90 days before the transfer. The agency owning the property shall negotiate with the agency gaining the facility for continued cross-servicing of the property at the facility. The agency gaining the facility shall continue the cross-servicing arrangements unless they are contrary to the best interest of the Government.

####### § 101-28.202-3 Cross-servicing rates.

Normally, charges for services rendered will be based upon the standard rates established by the agency for internal use. However, special rates may be negotiated to cover actual or estimated costs for large, bulk lots of material when the applicable rates appear inequitable, subject to the approval of the appropriate program official for the civilian agency, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (I and L) when DOD is involved.

####### § 101-28.202-4 Reimbursement for services.

Reimbursement for services rendered shall be made promptly after receipt of billing. The frequency for billing and reimbursement shall be established by the activity providing warehousing and storage services; however, billing and reimbursement shall be made not less frequently than quarterly nor more frequently than monthly.

####### § 101-28.203 Definitions.

As used in this subpart 101&#x2013;28.2, the following term shall apply.

####### § 101-28.203-1 Government storage activity.

A Government activity or facility utilized for the receipt, storage, and issue of supplies, materials, and equipment, including storage of reserve or excess stocks or intransit storage. The activity may be either Government owned or leased, and it may be either Government operated or contract operated.

####### §§ 101-28.203-2-101-28.203-3 [Reserved]

####### § 101-28.203-4 Contact point.

The point within the headquarters of a military service or civilian agency to which requests should be forwarded. Coordination necessary with various organizational elements within a military service or civilian agency shall be accomplished by the contact point.

###### Subpart 101-28.3 - Customer Supply Centers

####### § 101-28.300 Scope of subpart.

This subpart provides policy for the GSA customer supply center program, including policy on item stockage, services provided, and Federal agency participation.

####### § 101-28.301 Applicability.

This subpart is applicable to all activities that are eligible to use customer supply centers. Eligible activities include executive agencies, elements of the legislative and judicial branches of the Government, and cost reimbursable contractors. Customer supply centers are for the use of activities located within the market area of a customer supply center as determined by GSA.

####### § 101-28.302 Mission of customer supply centers.

Customer supply centers are retail supply distribution outlets established by GSA to provide efficient, economical support of frequently needed common-use expendable items for the accomplishment of customer agency missions.

####### § 101-28.303 Benefits provided by customer supply centers.

The customer supply centers (CSCs) provide the following:

(a) Overall savings to the Federal Government through volume purchases.

(b) Quick and easy catalog item selection and simplified order placement by telephone, mail, electronic mail, or customer walk-in for urgent agency requirements.

(c) Next business day shipment to the customer for most orders.

(d) Same day pick up of emergency walk-in and telephone orders.

(e) Immediate stock availability information for all telephone and walk-in orders.

(f) Extensive inventory designed to meet the needs of customer agencies within the geographic area served by each CSC.

(g) A detailed catalog which lists the items stocked and procedures for use of the CSC.

(h) Automated biweekly billings (consistent with DOD MILSBILLS).

(i) Other services as approved by the GSA Regional Administrator.

####### § 101-28.304 Item selection and stockage criteria.

####### § 101-28.304-1 Types of items.

Items stocked in customer supply centers are based on customer agency requirements for common use expendable items. In addition to administrative type items commonly used in Government offices, janitorial supplies, handtools, and other industrial-type items are stocked when required to meet the mission-related needs of the activities supported by the CSC.

####### § 101-28.304-2 Determining items to be stocked.

(a) Each CSC will stock administrative items normally required by Federal agencies for day-to-day operations. In addition to those items, each CSC will stock additional items as determined by the requirements of the activities within the geographic area it serves.

(b) Regional FSS offices will canvass customer agencies periodically to identify items for which there is an official need within their support area.

(c) Customer agencies may request that specific items be stocked by their support CSC. The requests must be submitted in writing to the appropriate-FSS Bureau Director and must be signed by a customer agency official at a level of responsibility (division director or higher) acceptable to the GSA Regional Administrator. All requests must indicate the expected monthly usage of the item requested. Each request will be evaluated and the submitting activity notified of the results of the evaluation.

####### § 101-28.305 Prices of customer supply center items.

The selling price of a CSC item is an average price which is calculated automatically by the CSC computer at the time the item is ordered. Items stocked in CSCs that are obtained from GSA wholesale supply distribution facilities are input into the computer at the price in effect at the time of shipment from the facilities (this price is normally the price shown in the GSA Supply Catalog). Items stocked in CSCs that are not available from GSA wholesale supply distribution facilities but which are obtained from other Government supply sources or commercial sources are input into the computer at the invoice cost. Due to cost averaging, item prices listed in the CSC catalog may differ somewhat from the sale price for a particular transaction.

####### § 101-28.306 Customer supply center (CSC) accounts and related controls.

####### § 101-28.306-1 Establishment of a CSC account by a customer activity.

(a) Eligible agencies should contact the GSA Regional Federal Supply Service Bureau to obtain full information on the use of the CSC for their locale. FSS Bureau personnel will provide assistance to agencies in the establishment of the CSC account, brief personnel on the use of the CSC to meet local, retail supply requirements, and provide copies of the CSC catalog.

(b) An appropriate level management official (division director of higher) authorized to obligate agency funds must sign the GSA Form 3525, Application for Customer Supply Services, requesting establishment of the CSC account for the activity.

####### § 101-28.306-2 Use of customer supply centers.

(a) Orders are received by the CSC via phone, mail, electronic mail, or in person on a walk-in basis for urgent agency requirements. All use of the CSC is based upon the customer access code assigned at the time of establishment of the activity account. The customer access code determines the ship-to point for orders placed with the CSC. The ship-to point cannot be changed, one established, except by the submission of a written request signed by an appropriate agency official.

(b) All orders placed with the CSC, except emergency pickup orders, described in § 101&#x2013;28.306&#x2013;1(c), will be shipped to the activity placing the order via mail or small parcel carrier not later than the end of the next business day.

(c) Walk-in orders for urgent requirements are accepted and filled immediately provided the individual placing the order has proper identification. Telephone orders placed in the morning may be picked up in the afternoon of the same day provided that the individual picking up the order possesses proper identification and the order ticket number provided by the CSC personnel at the time the order is placed.

####### § 101-28.306-3 Limitations on use.

(a) Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the use of the CSC account by the agency or other authorized activities is limited to the purchase of items for official Government use. The controls shall include written instructions that contain a statement prohibiting the use of the CSC account in acquiring items for other than Government use. When an agency makes a purchase of more than $500 per line item from a GSA customer supply center which is other than a similar lowest priced item available from a multiple-award schedule, GSA will assume that a justification has been prepared and made a part of the buying agency's purchase file. Availability of products, regardless of the total amount of the line item price, does not relieve an agency of the responsibility to select the lowest priced item commensurate with needs of the agency.

(b) Office supplies needed by Members of Congress and the Delegate of the District of Columbia for use in their offices in the House or Senate Office Buildings should be obtained from the Senate and Houses Representatives supply rooms, as appropriate. Members of Congress, except for the Delegate of the District of Columbia, should limit their use of the CSCs to those located outside of the District of Columbia. The Delegate of the District of Columbia may obtain office supplies for the use of his or her district offices from the CSC serving the District of Columbia.

####### § 101-28.306-4 Expiration or cancellation.

(a) CSC accounts established for Federal agencies or members of the Federal judiciary are valid for an indefinite period of time unless canceled by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a GSA Regional Administrator.

(b) CSC accounts established for authorized contractors or Members of Congress will contain an expiration date reflecting the termination date of the contract or term of office. New accounts will be established for reinstated contractors or reelected Members of Congress upon submission of a new application.

(c) Any CSC customer may request cancellation of his/her account when no longer required or whenever there is cause to believe that the customer access code has been compromised. Agencies shall keep GSA advised of any changes in organization or accounting structures that might have an impact on their CSC accounts.

(d) The Commissioner FSS, GSA, may periodically direct a nationwide purge of all CSC accounts to cancel those that are duplicates, not needed, or for which the customer access code has been compromised. Selective account cancellations may be directed by the GSA Regional Administrator in coordination with FSS Central Office. Under the procedures of a nationwide purge, CSC accounts become invalid as of a specific date established by the Commissioner, FSS, GSA, or by a Regional Administrator, and new CSC accounts are established upon receipt of new applications.

####### § 101-28.306-5 Safeguards.

Agencies shall establish internal controls to ensure that the customer access codes assigned for their accounts are properly protected. It is by use of these access codes that orders are accepted by the CSC and these codes determine the ship-to points for all orders filled by the CSC with the exception of orders picked up at the CSC by the customer. GSA will not change the ship-to location associated with the customer access code except upon receipt of a written request to do so, signed by a duly authorized official of the customer activity.

####### § 101-28.306-6 Sensitive items.

Many items stocked by the CSCs may be considered sensitive based upon standard criteria factors such as propensity for personal use, the potential for embarrassment of GSA and customer agencies, the level of customer complaints, and control as an accountable item of personal property. Each customer activity shall take all appropriate measures necessary to ensure that all items are properly controlled within its activity and are purchased solely for official Government use.

####### § 101-28.306-7 Responsibility for operation.

The GSA Regional Administrator is responsible for the operation of any CSCs located within his or her region.

###### § 101-28.000 Scope of part.

This part prescribes policy and procedures for the economical and efficient management of warehousing and related activities by executive agencies.

##### PART 101-29 - FEDERAL PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS

###### Subpart 101-29.1 - General

####### § 101-29.101 Federal product descriptions.

Federal and interim Federal specifications, their associated Federal qualified products lists (QPL's), Federal and interim Federal standards and Commercial item descriptions (CID's) are referred to collectively as Federal product descriptions. They are developed by GSA or other Federal agencies under the Assigned Agency Plan described in the “Federal Standardization Handbook” issued by the Assistant Administrator for Federal Supply and Services (FSS). Product descriptions are coordinated with other Federal agencies having technical, statutory, or regulatory interest in the commodity or other subject matter covered.

###### Subpart 101-30.4 - Use of the Federal Catalog System

####### § 101-30.400 Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures governing the dissemination of Federal catalog data, the conversion to and use of the Federal catalog system by Federal agencies, and the requesting of supply support from Government supply managers.

####### § 101-30.401 Data available from the Federal Catalog System.

Federal Catalog System data are available in publications of general interest to Government supply activities and in the form of automated output tailored to meet individual agency needs.

####### § 101-30.401-1 Publications providing Federal catalog data.

(a) Federal Catalog System publications contain selected data from the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) files chosen, assembled, and formatted to meet recognized needs for information in support of assigned missions, functions, and related responsibilities. Most publications are produced in microfiche form; however, some are produced in hard copy form. The following publications are available:

(1)A microfiche publication which contains a master list of national stock numbers (NSN's) cross-referenced to and from manufacturers' part numbers, specifications, or reference drawings. This publication is used to cross-relate reference numbers and stock numbers or to ascertain the manufacturer of an item when the reference number or the NSN is known.

(2)A microfiche publication arranged by Federal supply class and containing descriptions of items in the DLSC file. The principal uses of the IL are to obtain or verify an NSN when only the characteristics of the item are known or descriptive data when the NSN is known, and to determine interchangeable or substitutable items.

(3)A microfiche publication which is a consolidated listing of NSN's and related supply management data of each integrated manager and military service. These data include Government source of supply, unit of issue, unit price, etc.

(4)A microfiche publication containing complete identification data in tabular format for all descriptive-type item identifications. The data are arranged in NSN sequence within Federal supply class. An FILDR is known in hard copy form as a DD&#x2013;146 card which is furnished as an output to authorized receivers of Federal catalog data who cannot use other available output media.

(5)This publication (available in hard copy only) includes NSN's for which DLA is the single source of supply for civil agencies. These NSN's may not necessarily have a DOD user recorded. The publication contains descriptive and management data for items not usually listed in the GSA catalog but which might be required by civil agencies.

(b) Agencies may obtain without charge copies of the DLA Federal Supply Catalog for Civil Agencies, described in paragraph (a)(6)of this section by contacting the Defense Logistics Services Center, DLSC-TP, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49016. To obtain copies of the publications described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section, agencies may submit a request in writing to the same address shown above, except that the applicable mail distribution code is DLSC-AP. Information concerning the charges for the latter publications is available from DLSC-AP.

####### § 101-30.401-2 Automated catalog data output.

As a result of participation in the Federal catalog system, activities may receive data directly from DLSC tailored to their individual needs in support of their own supply management data system. The two basic categories of file maintenance are:

(a)Subscribers to this category of file maintenance are provided replacement files (magnetic tape) semiannually containing selected technical and supply management data for those items on which they are a registered user. The subscriber will also receive a monthly maintenance update and cumulative monthly basic records from DLSC which may be used to maintain the semiannual basic file. Recipients of this form of file maintenance have latitude in selecting those items which meet the needs of their supply system from the categories of data available from the Federal Catalog System.

(b)This form of the file maintenance provides activities with data on a daily basis as transactions affect items upon which they are a registered user. It is used primarily by those activities which consider it essential to maintain file compatibility with the DLSC file at all times.

####### § 101-30.402 Conversion.

Following completion of cataloging action, GSA will establish a time period in which conversion to the Federal Catalog System shall be accomplished by all civil agencies. The terminal dates for conversion will be established after consultation with the civil agencies concerned.

####### § 101-30.403 Utilization.

On and after the established date for completion of conversion, all interagency and intra-agency transactions involving item identifications, commodity classification, or stock numbers shall be in the terms of the Federal Catalog System.

####### § 101-30.403-1 Reports of excess and surplus personal property.

For items of personal property which have been identified in the Federal Catalog System, national stock numbers and Federal item identifications, with such additional descriptive detail as is required, shall be utilized in reports and listings of excess and surplus personal property. The assignment of national stock numbers and Federal item identifications shall not be required for items of excess or surplus personal property which have not been identified in the Federal Catalog System.

####### § 101-30.403-2 Management codes.

For internal use within an agency, alphabetic codes excluding letters “I” and “O” may be prefixed or suffixed to the national stock number as CM7520&#x2013;00&#x2013;123&#x2013;4567 or 7520&#x2013;00&#x2013;123&#x2013;4567CM, as required for supply management operations. Numeric codes shall not be affixed immediately adjacent to or as a part of the national stock number, nor shall codes be intermingled in the national stock number.

####### § 101-30.404 Supply support.

Civilian agencies requiring supply support on an item of supply shall request this action by preparing Standard Form 1303, Request for Federal Cataloging/Supply Support Action (illustrated at § 101&#x2013;30.4901&#x2013;1303), and submitting the form to the General Services Administration (FRIS), Washington, DC 20406. All supply support request for nonperishable subsistence items in Federal Supply Group 89, subsistence (except condiment packets in FSC classes 8940 and 8950), shall be submitted to the Veterans Administration, Catalog Division (901S), Veterans Administration Supply Depot, P.O. Box 27, Hines IL 60141. Guidance on the preparation of supply support requests is in the GSA Handbook, Federal Catalog System-Logistics Data (FPMR 101&#x2013;30.3), issued by the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service.

####### § 101-30.404-1 Consolidation of supply support requests.

Requests for supply support should be consolidated in one focal point within each agency or activity. On the basis of the total consolidated agency or activity requirement; i.e., annual demand, GSA can determine the most economical and efficient method of supply support.

###### Subpart 101-30.5 - Maintenance of the Federal Catalog System

####### § 101-30.701-1 Item reduction study.

means the study of a group of generally similar items which are subject to evaluation by physical and performance characteristics. This evaluation process identifies items determined to be unnecessarily similar or uneconomical for Government use and which will be considered for removal from Government supply systems. For items so identified, a replacement item shall be proposed. The result of item reduction studies will indicate items which are authorized for procurement or not authorized for procurement.

####### § 101-30.701-2 Item standardization code.

means a code assigned an item in the supply system which identifies the item as authorized for procurement or not authorized for procurement.

####### § 101-30.701-3 Preparing activity.

means a Government agency responsible for the preparation of item reduction studies, or an activity authorized by the listed agencies to conduct an item reduction study. The DOD Standardization Directory SD&#x2013;1 provides such a listing.

####### § 101-30.701-4 Standardization relationship.

means the relationship between the replaced item and the replacement item. The replaced item will contain an item standardization code designating the item as not authorized for procurement and therefore must have a replacement item. The relationship of the two items is displayed within the item reduction study by item standardization codes and, upon approval of the study, in the Federal catalog system data base at the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC).

####### § 101-30.702 Determining item reduction potential.

Item reduction studies are required where there are large numbers of generally similar items which are subject to grouping and examination by item name, item name modifiers, or other characteristics such as sizes, grades, lengths, and materials. Before conducting a full scale item reduction study, the assignee activity shall determine whether sufficient item reduction potential appears to exist. Item reduction studies shall be undertaken only when the expected benefits outweigh the costs of performing the study.

####### § 101-30.703 Program objectives.

The objective of the item reduction program is to reduce the varieties and sizes of similar items in the Government supply system by:

(a) Implementing a coordinated item reduction process among supply managers of using activities;

(b) Standardizing items of supply used by the Government;

(c) Ensuring that all participants in item reduction studies give priority to controlling and completing item reduction studies;

(d) Promptly recording decisions in the Federal catalog system data base; and

(e) Phasing out of the Government supply system those items identified in item reduction studies as not authorized for procurement to reduce cataloging, supply management, and warehousing costs; then following through to eliminate the items from agency catalog systems.

####### § 101-30.704 Agency responsibilities.

####### § 101-30.704-1 General Services Administration.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will develop or authorize other Government agencies to develop item reduction studies on items within the Federal supply classification (FSC) classes for which GSA is the integrated material manager.

(b) GSA, as the civil agency coordinating activity for item reduction studies originated by both GSA and DOD, will:

(1) Distribute proposed item reduction studies, as appropriate, to all civil agencies recorded as users of the item in the DLSC data base. This distribution will be made by coordination letters in which a time frame for a response will be specified. GSA will interpret each nonresponse to a proposed study to mean that the activity concurs with the study. Extensions, when requested by an agency, normally will be granted by GSA.

(2) Respond to questions concerning proposed item reduction studies.

(3) Prepare a consolidated civil agency position paper (including comments and nonconcurrences) relative to each study upon receipt of user responses.

(4) Incorporate civil agency positions into proposed item reduction studies prepared by GSA or forward a consolidated civil agency position paper to appropriate preparing activities.

(5) Resolve controversies arising from proposed item reduction study recommendations.

(6) Review approved item reduction studies to ensure that concurrences and nonconcurrences from all civil agencies are accurately reflected.

(7) Register into the Federal catalog system, data base approved item reduction decisions concerning items within the FSC classes which are managed by GSA.

(8) Implement decisions documented in approved item reduction studies within the GSA supply system.

(9) Distribute approved item reduction studies to all recorded civil agency users. All civil agencies (except direct submitters of catalog data to DLSC) will also be forwarded covering letters which will request specific information relative to implementing the studies; i.e., inventory levels of items coded ISC 3. Activities not responding within the time frame specified (60 calendar days) will receive a followup notice before being automatically withdrawn as users of all items coded as not authorized for procurement.

####### § 101-30.704-2 Other agencies.

Civil agencies participating in the Federal Catalog System shall:

(a) Conduct a review of the items included in the proposed study by the preparing activity with respect to the ISC to determine the impact the assigned code may have on the agency's supply system.

(b) Prepare and submit written comments on the proposed study to GSA within the time frame specified in the GSA coordination letter, concur with the study, or nonconcur on specific proposed standardization relationships. If comments cannot be prepared and submitted within the time frame specified, an extension shall be requested from GSA.

(c) Review the approved item reduction study and notify GSA in writing if the activity is to be retained or deleted as a user of any item coded as “not authorized for procurement.” This notification will allow the preparer of the study to complete coordination of the study and update the DLSC Total Item Record (TIR).

(d) Implement within the agency those item reduction decisions resulting from the study.

(e) Request, as appropriate, the retention of a nonstandard item in their supply system by forwarding a letter to General Services Administration (FRIS), Washington, DC 20406. The request shall include but not be limited to the following information:

(1) The specific end-use of end-item application;

(2) A technical explanation comparing the physical and functional characteristics of the nonstandard item with each authorized-for-procurement item;

(3) The duration of the requirement for the item or how long the end-item will be retained in the agency's supply system; and

(4) Economic considerations from a technical standpoint. GSA will evaluate the request and inform the agency of its acceptance or rejection.

####### § 101-30.705 GSA assistance.

Activities requiring assistance in fulfilling their responsibilities under the program shall contact the General Services Administration (FRI), Washington, DC 20406.

Federal employees on TDY requiring short-term use of vehicles in the destination area shall obtain service directly from the appropriate sources listed in the Federal Travel Directory (available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402).

####### § 101-39.204 Obtaining motor vehicles for indefinite assignment.

Motor vehicles and related services of the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) are provided to requesting agencies under the following procedures. When competing requests are received, priority will be given to a fully participating agency over an other than fully participating agency.

(a) Federal agencies or parts thereof that meet the following conditions are considered fully participating:

(1) All agency-owned motor vehicles have been consolidated into the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center, and no agency-owned vehicles, with the exception of approved exemptions, are operated in the defined mandatory use service area of the supporting GSA fleet management center;

(2) No vehicles were available to consolidate, but total reliance is placed on the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center or the GSA IFMS as a whole to meet all motor vehicle requirements, and no agency-owned vehicles are operated in the defined mandatory use service area of the supporting GSA fleet management center;

(3) The agency would otherwise qualify under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section but has been authorized by GSA to purchase or commercially lease motor vehicles because the GSA IFMS was unable to supply its requirements.

(b) Fully participating agencies may request indefinite assignment of vehicles, regardless of number, from the supporting IFMS fleet management center. Assignment may be made at that level, subject to availability. If the required vehicles are not available, a written request shall be sent to the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, Washington, DC, 20406. To be considered, the request shall include the following:

(1) Certification that concurrence has been obtained from the designated agency fleet manager or other designated headquarters-level official and that other means of transportation are not feasible or cost-effective;

(2) The number and types of vehicles required, of which passenger vehicles are limited to compact or smaller unless the agency head or designee has certified that larger vehicles are essential to the agency's mission;

(3) Location where the vehicles are needed;

(4) Date required, including earliest and latest acceptable dates;

(5) Anticipated length of assignment;

(6) Projected utilization, normally in terms of miles per month or year;

(7) Certification of funding;

(8) Billing address and billed office address code (BOAC);

(9) Agency contact, including name, address, and telephone number;

(10) Office, program, or activity requiring the vehicles;

(11) A statement that the agency does or does not request authority to commercially lease, and the anticipated duration of the lease, should GSA be unable to provide the vehicles.

(c) Federal agencies that meet the following conditions are considered other than fully participating:

(1) Vehicles have been acquired from other sources for reasons other than the inability of the GSA IFMS to supply the required vehicles, except those designated as exempt vehicles as determined by the GSA IFMS;

(2) Cost reimbursable contractors authorized to utilize GSA IFMS motor vehicles when they represent participating agencies;

(3) Other authorized users of the GSA IFMS.

(d) Other than fully participating agencies must contact the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center to ascertain vehicle availability, regardless of the number required. If the vehicles are available, assignment shall be made. When the supporting GSA IFMS fleet management center determines that the requested vehicles are not available, the requesting activity shall make a record of contact to document compliance with the mandatory first source of supply requirement. No further authorizations from GSA are required for the agency to execute a commercial lease from sources established by the GSA Automotive Commodity Center or the agency, provided that such agency has Congressional authority to lease motor vehicles and:

(1) All applicable procurement regulations (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) and internal agency acquisition regulations are observed;

(2) The requirements of part 101&#x2013;38 of this chapter regarding fuel economy, Government identification and marking, etc., are adhered to;

(3) The agency fleet manager or designee retains responsibility for fleet oversight and reporting requirements under Public Law 99&#x2013;272; and

(4) Other than fully participating agencies that choose not to commercially lease may utilize the procedures for full participants in paragraph (b) of this section, on the understanding that fully participating agencies will receive priority consideration.

####### § 101-39.205 [Reserved]

####### § 101-39.206 Seasonal or unusual requirements.

Agencies or activities having seasonal, peak, or unusual requirements for vehicles or related services shall inform the GSA IFMS fleet management center as far in advance as possible. Normally, notice shall be given not less than 3 months in advance of the need. Requests for vehicles for other than indefinite assignment will usually be filled for agencies participating fully with the GSA IFMS, provided resources permit. Other than fully participating agencies will normally not be accommodated for seasonal, peak, or unusual vehicle requirements.

####### § 101-39.207 Reimbursement for services.

(a) GSA Regional Administrators will issue, as appropriate, regional bulletins announcing the GSA vehicle rental rates applicable to their respective regions.

(b) The using agency will be billed for GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) services provided for under this part at rates fixed by GSA. Such rates are designed to recover all GSA IFMS fixed and variable costs. Rates will be reviewed and revised periodically to determine that reimbursement is sufficient to recover applicable costs. Failure by using agencies to reimburse GSA for vehicle services will be cause for GSA to terminate motor vehicle assignments.

(c) IFMS services provided to authorized Government contractors and subcontractors will be billed to the responsible agency unless such agency requests that the contractor be billed directly. In case of nonpayment by a contractor, GSA will bill the responsible agency which authorized the contractor's use of GSA IFMS services.

(d) Using agencies will be billed for accidents and incidents as described in § 101&#x2013;39.406. Agencies may also be charged administrative fees when vehicles are not properly maintained, repaired, or when the vehicle is subject to abuse or neglect.

(e) Agencies may be charged for recovery of expenses for repairs or services to GSA IFMS vehicles which are not authorized by the GSA IFMS either through preventive maintenance notices, approval from a GSA Maintenance Control Center, or approval from a GSA fleet management center, per instructions in the operator's guide issued with each vehicle. Excess costs relating to the failure to utilize self-service gasoline pumps or the unnecessary use of premium grade gasoline may also be recovered from using agencies (see § 101&#x2013;38.401&#x2013;2 of this chapter).

####### § 101-39.208 Vehicles removed from defined areas.

(a) Normally, vehicles shall not be permanently operated outside the geographical area served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center. However, when agency programs necessitate vehicle relocation for a period exceeding 90 calendar days, the agency shall notify the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center of the following:

(1) The location at which the vehicles are currently in use;

(2) The date the vehicles were moved to the present location; and

(3) The expected date the vehicles will be returned to the original location.

(b) When vehicles will be permanently relocated outside the area served by the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center, the affected GSA IFMS fleet manager will ascertain if the using agency is fully participating at the new location (see § 101&#x2013;39.204). If this criterion is met, the vehicle will normally be transferred to the GSA IFMS fleet management center nearest the new location. If the agency is other than a full participant, the transfer will be treated as a request for additional vehicles at the new location.

###### Subpart 101-39.3 - Use and Care of GSA Interagency Fleet Management System Vehicles

####### § 101-39.300 General.

(a) The objective of the General Services Administration (GSA) Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) is to provide efficient and economical motor vehicle and related services to participating agencies.

(d) The use of tobacco products is prohibited in GSA IFMS motor vehicles. The agency to which the vehicle is assigned is responsible for ensuring that its employees do not use tobacco products while occupying IFMS vehicles. If a user agency violates this prohibition, the agency will be charged for the cost of cleaning the affected vehicle(s) beyond normal detailing procedures to remove tobacco odor or residue or repairing damage caused as a result of tobacco use. The decision to perform such additional cleaning or repair will be made by the GSA fleet manager based upon the condition of the vehicle when assigned, the degree of tobacco residue and damage, and the cost effectiveness of such additional cleaning.

(e) Reasonable diligence in the care of GSA IFMS vehicles shall be exercised by using agencies and operators at all times. Officials or employees failing to take proper care of motor vehicles issued to them may be refused further authorization to use GSA IFMS vehicles after reasonable notice has been provided by GSA to the head of the local activity concerned.

####### § 101-39.301 Utilization guidelines.

An agency must be able to justify a full-time vehicle assignment. The following guidelines may be employed by an agency requesting GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) services. Other utilization factors, such as days used, agency mission, and the relative costs of alternatives to a full-time vehicle assignment, may be considered as justification where miles traveled guidelines are not met.

(a)The utilization guidelines for passenger-carrying vehicles are a minimum of 3,000 miles per quarter or 12,000 miles per year.

(b)The utilization guidelines for light trucks and general purpose vehicles are as follows:

(1)Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and under&#x2014;10,000 miles per year.

(2)GVWR to 24,000 lbs. GVWR&#x2014;7,500 miles per year.

(c)The utilization guidelines for heavy trucks and truck tractors are as follows:

(1)GVWR&#x2014;7,500 miles per year.

However, the head of the local office of the agency or his/her designee shall cooperate with GSA IFMS fleet management center personnel in studying the use of this equipment and take necessary action to ensure that it is reasonably utilized or returned to the issuing GSA IFMS fleet management center.

####### § 101-39.302 Rotation.

GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicles on high mileage assignments may be rotated with those on low mileage assignments to assure more uniform overall fleet utilization. In cases where the continued use of a vehicle is essential but its miles traveled are not consistent with utilization guidelines, the using agency may be required to justify, in writing, retention of the vehicle. Each GSA IFMS fleet manager will decide on a case-by-case basis which vehicles, if any, will be rotated based upon vehicle type, vehicle location, location and availability of replacement vehicles, and the mission of the using agency.

####### § 101-39.303 Maintenance.

In order to ensure uninterrupted operation of GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicles, safety and preventive maintenance inspections will be performed at regularly scheduled intervals as directed by GSA. Users of GSA IFMS vehicles shall comply with the safety and preventive maintenance notices and instructions issued for the vehicle.

####### § 101-39.304 Modification or installation of accessory equipment.

The modification of a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle or the permanent installation of accessory equipment on these vehicles may be accomplished only when approved by GSA. For the purpose of this regulation, permanent installation means the actual bolting, fitting, or securing of an item to the vehicle. Such modification or installation of accessory equipment must be considered by the agency as essential for the accomplishment of the agency's mission. The request for such modification or installation shall be forwarded to the appropriate GSA IFMS regional fleet manager for consideration. Accessory equipment or other after-market items which project an inappropriate appearance, such as radar detectors, will not be used on GSA IFMS vehicles. Decorative items (i.e., bumper stickers and decals) will not be used on IFMS vehicles unless authorized by the Director, Fleet Management Division, GSA.

####### § 101-39.305 Storage.

(a) Every accident involving a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle shall be investigated and a report furnished to the manager of the GSA IFMS fleet management center which issued the vehicle.

(b) The agency employing the vehicle operator shall investigate the accident within 48 hours after the actual time of occurrence. Also, GSA may investigate any accident involving an IFMS vehicle when deemed necessary. Should such investigation develop additional information, the additional data or facts will be furnished to the using agency for its information.

(c) Two copies of the complete report of the investigation, including (when available) photographs, measurements, doctor's certificate of bodily injuries, police investigation reports, operator's statement, agency's investigation reports, witnesses' statements, the Motor Vehicle Accident Report (SF 91), and any other pertinent data shall be furnished to the manager of the GSA IFMS fleet management center issuing the vehicle.

####### § 101-39.404 Claims in favor of the Government.

Whenever there is any indication that a party other than the operator of the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle is at fault and that party can be reasonably identified, the agency responsible for investigating the accident shall submit all original documents and data pertaining to the accident and its investigation to the servicing GSA IFMS fleet management center. The GSA IFMS regional fleet manager, or his/her representative, will initiate the necessary action to effect recovery of the Government's claim.

####### § 101-39.405 Claims against the Government.

(a) Whenever a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle is involved in an accident resulting in damage to the property of, or injury to, a third party, and the third party asserts a claim against the Government based on the alleged negligence of the vehicle operator (acting within the scope of his or her duties), it shall be the responsibility of the agency employing the person who was operating the GSA IFMS vehicle at the time of the accident to make every effort to settle the claim administratively to the extent that the agency is empowered to do so under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2672. It shall be the further responsibility of the agency, in the event that administrative settlement cannot be effected, to prepare completely, from an administrative standpoint, the Government's defense of the claim. The agency shall thereafter transmit the complete case through appropriate channels to the Department of Justice.

(b) Except for the exclusions listed in § 101&#x2013;39.406, the agency employing the vehicle operator shall be financially responsible for damage to a GSA IFMS vehicle.

(c) If a law suit is filed against the agency using a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle, the agency shall furnish the appropriate GSA Regional Counsel with a copy of all papers served in the action. When requested, GSA's Regional Counsel will cooperate with and assist the using agency and the Department of Justice in defense of any action against the United States, the using agency, or the operator of the vehicle, arising out of the use of a GSA IFMS vehicle.

####### § 101-39.406 Responsibility for damages.

(a) GSA will charge the using agency all costs resulting from damage, including vandalism, theft, and parking lot damage, to a GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) vehicle which occurs during the period that the vehicle is assigned or issued to that agency, to an employee of that agency, or to the agency's authorized contractor; however, the using agency will not be held responsible for damages to the vehicle if it is determined by GSA, after a review on a case by case basis of the documentation required by § 101&#x2013;39.401, that damage to the vehicle occurred:

(1) As a result of the negligent or willful act of a party other than the agency (or the employee of that agency) to which the vehicle was assigned or issued and the identity of the party can be reasonably determined;

(2) As a result of mechanical failure of the vehicle, and the using agency (or its employee) is not otherwise negligent. Proof of mechanical failure must be submitted; or

(3) As a result of normal wear and tear such as is expected in the operation of a similar vehicle.

(b) Agencies using GSA IFMS services will be billed for the total cost of all damages resulting from neglect or abuse of assigned or issued GSA IFMS vehicles.

(c) If an agency is held responsible for damages, GSA will charge to that agency all costs for removing and repairing the GSA IFMS vehicle. If the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair, GSA will charge all costs to that agency, including fair market value of the vehicle less any salvage value. Upon request, GSA will furnish an accident report, where applicable, regarding the incident to the agency. Each agency shall be responsible for disciplining its employees who are guilty of damaging GSA IFMS vehicles through misconduct or improper operation, including inattention.

(d) If an agency has information or facts that indicate that it was not responsible for an accident, the agency may furnish the data to GSA requesting that costs charged to and collected from it be credited to the agency. GSA will make the final determination of agency responsibility based upon Government findings, police accident reports, and any available witness statements.

(e) When contractors or subcontractors of using agencies are in accidents involving GSA IFMS vehicles, the agency employing the contractor will usually be billed directly for all costs associated with the accident. It will be the responsibility of the using agency to collect accident costs from the contractor should the contractor be at fault.

####### § 101-39.407 Accident records.

If GSA's records of vehicle accidents indicate that a particular activity has had an unusually high accident frequency rate or a high accident cost per mile, GSA will so advise the using activity. Corrective action will be requested and GSA will cooperate in any reasonable manner possible to bring about improved performance.

##### PART 102-3 - FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT

###### Subpart A - What Policies Apply to Advisory Committees Established Within the Executive Branch?

####### § 102-3.5 What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

This subpart provides the policy framework that must be used by agency heads in applying the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C., App., to advisory committees they establish and operate. In addition to listing key definitions underlying the interpretation of the Act, this subpart establishes the scope and applicability of the Act, and outlines specific exclusions from its coverage.

####### § 102-3.10 What is the purpose of the Federal Advisory Committee Act?

FACA governs the establishment, operation, and termination of advisory committees within the executive branch of the Federal Government. The Act defines what constitutes a Federal advisory committee and provides general procedures for the executive branch to follow for the operation of these advisory committees. In addition, the Act is designed to assure that the Congress and the public are kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, and cost of advisory committees.

####### § 102-3.15 Who are the intended users of this part?

(a) The primary users of this Federal Advisory Committee Management part are:

(1) Executive branch officials and others outside Government currently involved with an established advisory committee;

(2) Executive branch officials who seek to establish or utilize an advisory committee;

(3) Executive branch officials and others outside Government who have decided to pursue, or who are already engaged in, a form of public involvement or consultation and want to avoid inadvertently violating the Act; and

(4) Field personnel of Federal agencies who are increasingly involved with the public as part of their efforts to increase collaboration and improve customer service.

(b) Other types of end-users of this part include individuals and organizations outside of the executive branch who seek to understand and interpret the Act, or are seeking additional guidance.

####### § 102-3.20 How does this part meet the needs of its audience?

This Federal Advisory Committee Management part meets the general and specific needs of its audience by addressing the following issues and related topics:

(a)This part provides guidance on the threshold issue of what constitutes an advisory committee and clarifies the limits of coverage by the Act for the benefit of the intended users of this part.

(b)This part defines the policies, establishes minimum requirements, and provides guidance to Federal officers and agencies for the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees subject to the Act. This includes reporting requirements that keep Congress and the public informed of the number, purpose, membership, activities, benefits, and costs of these advisory committees. These requirements form the basis for implementing the Act at both the agency and Governmentwide levels.

(c)This part provides summary-level key points and principles at the end of each subpart that provide more clarification on the role of Federal advisory committees in the larger context of public involvement in Federal decisions and activities. This includes a discussion of the applicability of the Act to different decisionmaking scenarios.

####### § 102-3.25 What definitions apply to this part?

The following definitions apply to this Federal Advisory Committee Management part:

means the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C., App.

means the Administrator of General Services.

subject to the Act, except as specifically exempted by the Act or by other statutes, or as not covered by this part, means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, which is established by statute, or established or utilized by the President or by an agency official, for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or on issues or policies within the scope of an agency official's responsibilities.

has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 551(1).

means the individual designated by the agency head to implement the provisions of section 8(b) of the Act and any delegated responsibilities of the agency head under the Act.

means the organization established pursuant to section 7(a) of the Act, which is responsible for all matters relating to advisory committees, and carries out the responsibilities of the Administrator under the Act and Executive Order 12024 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 158).

means any gathering of advisory committee members (whether in person or through electronic means) held with the approval of an agency for the purpose of deliberating on the substantive matters upon which the advisory committee provides advice or recommendations.

means an individual who serves by appointment or invitation on an advisory committee or subcommittee.

means any Federal employee, private individual, or other party (whether under contract or not) who is not a committee member, and who serves in a support capacity to an advisory committee or subcommittee.

means an individual designated by the agency head, for each advisory committee for which the agency head is responsible, to implement the provisions of sections 10(e) and (f) of the Act and any advisory committee procedures of the agency under the control and supervision of the CMO.

means any advisory committee that is established under the authority of an agency head or authorized by statute. An advisory committee referenced in general (non-specific) authorizing language or Congressional committee report language is discretionary, and its establishment or termination is within the legal discretion of an agency head.

means any Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the Congress in law, or by President or the President's delegate, to an agency for administrative and other support.

means any advisory committee either required by statute or by Presidential directive. Arequired by statute generally is identified specifically in a statute by name, purpose, or functions, and its establishment or termination is beyond the legal discretion of an agency head.

means any advisory committee authorized by the Congress or directed by the President to advise the President.

means a group, generally not subject to the Act, that reports to an advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer or agency, whether or not its members are drawn in whole or in part from the parent advisory committee.

for the purposes of the Act, does not have its ordinary meaning. A committee that is not established by the Federal Government iswithin the meaning of the Act when the President or a Federal office or agency exercises actual management or control over its operation.

####### § 102-3.30 What policies govern the use of advisory committees?

The policies to be followed by Federal departments and agencies in establishing and operating advisory committees consistent with the Act are as follows:

(a)A discretionary advisory committee may be established only when it is essential to the conduct of agency business and when the information to be obtained is not already available through another advisory committee or source within the Federal Government. Reasons for deciding that an advisory committee is needed may include whether:

(1) Advisory committee deliberations will result in the creation or elimination of (or change in) regulations, policies, or guidelines affecting agency business;

(2) The advisory committee will make recommendations resulting in significant improvements in service or reductions in cost; or

(3) The advisory committee's recommendations will provide an important additional perspective or viewpoint affecting agency operations.

(b)An advisory committee must be terminated when:

(1) The stated objectives of the committee have been accomplished;

(2) The subject matter or work of the committee has become obsolete by the passing of time or the assumption of the committee's functions by another entity;

(3) The agency determines that the cost of operation is excessive in relation to the benefits accruing to the Federal Government;

(4) In the case of a discretionary advisory committee, upon the expiration of a period not to exceed two years, unless renewed;

(5) In the case of a non-discretionary advisory committee required by Presidential directive, upon the expiration of a period not to exceed two years, unless renewed by authority of the President; or

(6) In the case of a non-discretionary advisory committee required by statute, upon the expiration of the time explicitly specified in the statute, or implied by operation of the statute.

(c)An advisory committee must be fairly balanced in its membership in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed.

(d)Advisory committee meetings must be open to the public except where a closed or partially-closed meeting has been determined proper and consistent with the exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), as the basis for closure.

(e)The function of advisory committees is advisory only, unless specifically provided by statute or Presidential directive.

####### § 102-3.35 What policies govern the use of subcommittees?

(a) In general, the requirements of the Act and the policies of this Federal Advisory Committee Management part do not apply to subcommittees of advisory committees that report to a parent advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer or agency. However, this section does not preclude an agency from applying any provision of the Act and this part to any subcommittee of an advisory committee in any particular instance.

(b) The creation and operation of subcommittees must be approved by the agency establishing the parent advisory committee.

####### § 102-3.40 What types of committees or groups are not covered by the Act and this part?

The following are examples of committees or groups that are not covered by the Act or this Federal Advisory Committee Management part:

(a)Any committee created by NAS or NAPA in accordance with section 15 of the Act, except as otherwise covered by subpart E of this part;

(b)Any advisory committee established or utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Reserve System;

(c)Any committee specifically exempted from the Act by law;

(d)Any committee or group created by non-Federal entities (such as a contractor or private organization), provided that these committees or groups are not actually managed or controlled by the executive branch;

(e)Any group that meets with a Federal official(s), including a public meeting, where advice is sought from the attendees on an individual basis and not from the group as a whole;

(f)Any group that meets with a Federal official(s) for the purpose of exchanging facts or information;

(g)Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government and elected officers of State, local and tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf), acting in their official capacities. However, the purpose of such a committee must be solely to exchange views, information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs established pursuant to statute, that explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or administration (see guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on section 204(b) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), OMB Memorandum M&#x2013;95&#x2013;20, dated September 21, 1995, available from the Committee Management Secretariat (MC), General Services Administration, 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405&#x2013;0002);

(h)Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government;

(i)Any local civic group whose primary function is that of rendering a public service with respect to a Federal program;

(j)Any State or local committee, council, board, commission, or similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or local officials or agencies; and

(k)Any committee established to perform primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those specifically authorized by statute or Presidential directive, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. A committee designated operational may be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature. It is the responsibility of the administering agency to determine whether a committee is primarily operational. If so, it does not fall under the requirements of the Act and this part.

###### Subpart B - How Are Advisory Committees Established, Renewed, Reestablished, and Terminated?

####### § 102-3.45 What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

Requirements for establishing and terminating advisory committees vary depending on the establishing entity and the source of authority for the advisory committee. This subpart covers the procedures associated with the establishment, renewal, reestablishment, and termination of advisory committees. These procedures include consulting with the Secretariat, preparing and filing an advisory committee charter, publishing notice in theand amending an advisory committee charter.

####### § 102-3.50 What are the authorities for establishing advisory committees?

FACA identifies four sources of authority for establishing an advisory committee:

(a)By law where the Congress establishes an advisory committee, or specifically directs the President or an agency to establish it ();

(b)By Executive order of the President or other Presidential directive ();

(c)By law where the Congress authorizes, but does not direct the President or an agency to establish it (); or

(d)By an agency under general authority in title 5 of the United States Code or under other general agency-authorizing statutes ().

####### § 102-3.55 What rules apply to the duration of an advisory committee?

(a) An advisory committee automatically terminates two years after its date of establishment unless:

(1) The statutory authority used to establish the advisory committee provides a different duration;

(2) The President or agency head determines that the advisory committee has fulfilled the purpose for which it was established and terminates the advisory committee earlier;

(3) The President or agency head determines that the advisory committee is no longer carrying out the purpose for which it was established and terminates the advisory committee earlier; or

(4) The President or agency head renews the committee not later than two years after its date of establishment in accordance with § 102&#x2013;3.60. If an advisory committee needed by the President or an agency terminates because it was not renewed in a timely manner, or if the advisory committee has been terminated under the provisions of § 102&#x2013;3.30(b), it can be reestablished in accordance with § 102&#x2013;3.60.

(b) When an advisory committee terminates, the agency shall notify the Secretariat of the effective date of the termination.

####### § 102-3.60 What procedures are required to establish, renew, or reestablish a discretionary advisory committee?

(a)Before establishing, renewing, or reestablishing a discretionary advisory committee and filing the charter as addressed later in § 102&#x2013;3.70, the agency head must consult with the Secretariat. As part of this consultation, agency heads are encouraged to engage in constructive dialogue with the Secretariat. With a full understanding of the background and purpose behind the proposed advisory committee, the Secretariat may share its knowledge and experience with the agency on how best to make use of the proposed advisory committee, suggest alternate methods of attaining its purpose that the agency may wish to consider, or inform the agency of a pre-existing advisory committee performing similar functions.

(b)Consultations covering the establishment, renewal, and reestablishment of advisory committees must, as a minimum, contain the following information:

(1)An explanation stating why the advisory committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and in the public interest;

(2)An explanation stating why the advisory committee's functions cannot be performed by the agency, another existing committee, or other means such as a public hearing; and

(3)A description of the agency's plan to attain fairly balanced membership. The plan will ensure that, in the selection of members for the advisory committee, the agency will consider a cross-section of those directly affected, interested, and qualified, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the advisory committee. Advisory committees requiring technical expertise should include persons with demonstrated professional or personal qualifications and experience relevant to the functions and tasks to be performed.

####### § 102-3.65 What are the public notification requirements for discretionary advisory committees?

A notice to the public in theis required when a discretionary advisory committee is established, renewed, or reestablished.

(a)Upon receiving notice from the Secretariat that its review is complete in accordance with § 102&#x2013;3.60(a), the agency must publish a notice in theannouncing that the advisory committee is being established, renewed, or reestablished. For the establishment of a new advisory committee, the notice also must describe the nature and purpose of the advisory committee and affirm that the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest.

(b)Notices of establishment and reestablishment of advisory committees must appear at least 15 calendar days before the charter is filed, except that the Secretariat may approve less than 15 calendar days when requested by the agency for good cause. This requirement for advance notice does not apply to advisory committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with the filing of the charter.

####### § 102-3.70 What are the charter filing requirements?

No advisory committee may meet or take any action until a charter has been filed by the Committee Management Officer (CMO) designated in accordance with section 8(b) of the Act, or by another agency official designated by the agency head.

(a)To establish, renew, or reestablish a discretionary advisory committee, a charter must be filed with:

(1) The agency head;

(2) The standing committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction of the agency, the date of filing with which constitutes the official date of establishment for the advisory committee;

(3) The Library of Congress, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, Government Documents Section, Federal Advisory Committee Desk, 101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540&#x2013;4172; and

(4) The Secretariat, indicating the date the charter was filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(b)Charter filing requirements for non-discretionary advisory committees are the same as those in paragraph (a) of this section, except the date of establishment for a Presidential advisory committee is the date the charter is filed with the Secretariat.

(c)Subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or agency must comply with this subpart and include in a charter the information required by § 102&#x2013;3.75.

####### § 102-3.75 What information must be included in the charter of an advisory committee?

(a)An advisory committee charter is intended to provide a description of an advisory committee's mission, goals, and objectives. It also provides a basis for evaluating an advisory committee's progress and effectiveness. The charter must contain the following information:

(1) The advisory committee's official designation;

(2) The objectives and the scope of the advisory committee's activity;

(3) The period of time necessary to carry out the advisory committee's purpose(s);

(4) The agency or Federal officer to whom the advisory committee reports;

(5) The agency responsible for providing the necessary support to the advisory committee;

(6) A description of the duties for which the advisory committee is responsible and specification of the authority for any non-advisory functions;

(7) The estimated annual costs to operate the advisory committee in dollars and person years;

(8) The estimated number and frequency of the advisory committee's meetings;

(9) The planned termination date, if less than two years from the date of establishment of the advisory committee;

(10) The name of the President's delegate, agency, or organization responsible for fulfilling the reporting requirements of section 6(b) of the Act, if appropriate; and

(11) The date the charter is filed in accordance with § 102&#x2013;3.70.

(b) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (11) of this section apply to all subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or agency.

####### § 102-3.80 How are minor charter amendments accomplished?

(a)The agency head is responsible for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amendments may be either minor or major. The procedures for making changes and filing amended charters will depend upon the authority basis for the advisory committee. Amending any existing advisory committee charter does not constitute renewal of the advisory committee under § 102&#x2013;3.60.

(b)To make a minor amendment to an advisory committee charter, such as changing the name of the advisory committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, the following procedures must be followed:

(1)The agency head must ensure that any minor technical changes made to current charters are consistent with the relevant authority. When the Congress by law, or the President by Executive order, changes the authorizing language that has been the basis for establishing an advisory committee, the agency head or the chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must amend those sections of the current charter affected by the new statute or Executive order, and file the amended charter as specified in § 102&#x2013;3.70.

(2)The charter of a discretionary advisory committee may be amended when an agency head determines that technical provisions of a filed charter are inaccurate, or specific provisions have changed or become obsolete with the passing of time, and that these amendments will not alter the advisory committee's objectives and scope substantially. The agency must amend the charter language as necessary and file the amended charter as specified in § 102&#x2013;3.70.

####### § 102-3.85 How are major charter amendments accomplished?

Procedures for making major amendments to advisory committee charters, such as substantial changes in objectives and scope, duties, and estimated costs, are the same as in § 102&#x2013;3.80, except that for discretionary advisory committees an agency must:

(a) Consult with the Secretariat on the amended language, and explain the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary; and

(b) File the amended charter as specified in § 102&#x2013;3.70.

###### Subpart C - How Are Advisory Committees Managed?

####### § 102-3.90 What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

This subpart outlines specific responsibilities and functions to be carried out by the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency head, the Committee Management Officer (CMO), and the Designated Federal Officer (DFO) under the Act.

####### § 102-3.95 What principles apply to the management of advisory committees?

Agencies are encouraged to apply the following principles to the management of their advisory committees:

(a)Before establishing an advisory committee, agencies should identify requirements and assure that adequate resources are available to support anticipated activities. Considerations related to support include office space, necessary supplies and equipment, Federal staff support, and access to key decisionmakers.

(b)Advisory committee members and staff should be fully aware of the advisory committee's mission, limitations, if any, on its duties, and the agency's goals and objectives. In general, the more specific an advisory committee's tasks and the more focused its activities are, the higher the likelihood will be that the advisory committee will fulfill its mission.

(c)Advisory committee members and their agency sponsors should work together to assure that a plan and necessary procedures covering implementation are in place to support an advisory committee's mission. In particular, agencies should be clear regarding what functions an advisory committee can perform legally and those that it cannot perform.

(d)In addition to achieving the minimum standards of public access established by the Act and this part, agencies should seek to be as inclusive as possible. For example, agencies may wish to explore the use of the Internet to post advisory committee information and seek broader input from the public.

(e)Agencies continually should seek feedback from advisory committee members and the public regarding the effectiveness of the advisory committee's activities. At regular intervals, agencies should communicate to the members how their advice has affected agency programs and decisionmaking.

####### § 102-3.100 What are the responsibilities and functions of GSA?

(a) Under section 7 of the Act, the General Services Administration (GSA) prepares regulations on Federal advisory committees to be prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, issues other administrative guidelines and management controls for advisory committees, and assists other agencies in implementing and interpreting the Act. Responsibility for these activities has been delegated by the Administrator to the GSA Committee Management Secretariat.

(b) The Secretariat carries out its responsibilities by:

(1) Conducting an annual comprehensive review of Governmentwide advisory committee accomplishments, costs, benefits, and other indicators to measure performance;

(2) Developing and distributing Governmentwide training regarding the Act and related statutes and principles;

(3) Supporting the Interagency Committee on Federal Advisory Committee Management in its efforts to improve compliance with the Act;

(4) Designing and maintaining a Governmentwide shared Internet-based system to facilitate collection and use of information required by the Act;

(5) Identifying performance measures that may be used to evaluate advisory committee accomplishments; and

(6) Providing recommendations for transmittal by the Administrator to the Congress and the President regarding proposals to improve accomplishment of the objectives of the Act.

####### § 102-3.105 What are the responsibilities of an agency head?

The head of each agency that establishes or utilizes one or more advisory committees must:

(a) Comply with the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee Management part;

(b) Issue administrative guidelines and management controls that apply to all of the agency's advisory committees subject to the Act;

(c) Designate a Committee Management Officer (CMO);

(d) Provide a written determination stating the reasons for closing any advisory committee meeting to the public, in whole or in part, in accordance with the exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), as the basis for closure;

(e) Review, at least annually, the need to continue each existing advisory committee, consistent with the public interest and the purpose or functions of each advisory committee;

(f) Determine that rates of compensation for members (if they are paid for their services) and staff of, and experts and consultants to advisory committees are justified and that levels of agency support are adequate;

(g) Develop procedures to assure that the advice or recommendations of advisory committees will not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest, but will instead be the result of the advisory committee's independent judgment;

(h) Assure that the interests and affiliations of advisory committee members are reviewed for conformance with applicable conflict of interest statutes, regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) including any supplemental agency requirements, and other Federal ethics rules;

(i) Designate a Designated Federal Officer (DFO) for each advisory committee and its subcommittees; and

(j) Provide the opportunity for reasonable participation by the public in advisory committee activities, subject to § 102&#x2013;3.140 and the agency's guidelines.

####### § 102-3.110 What are the responsibilities of a chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee?

The chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must:

(a) Comply with the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee Management part;

(b) Consult with the Secretariat concerning the designation of a Committee Management Officer (CMO) and Designated Federal Officer (DFO); and

(c) Consult with the Secretariat in advance regarding any proposal to close any meeting in whole or in part.

####### § 102-3.115 What are the responsibilities and functions of an agency Committee Management Officer (CMO)?

In addition to implementing the provisions of section 8(b) of the Act, the CMO will carry out all responsibilities delegated by the agency head. The CMO also should ensure that sections 10(b), 12(a), and 13 of the Act are implemented by the agency to provide for appropriate recordkeeping. Records to be kept by the CMO include, but are not limited to:

(a)A set of filed charters for each advisory committee and membership lists for each advisory committee and subcommittee;

(b) Approve the agenda, except that this requirement does not apply to a Presidential advisory committee;

(c) Attend the meetings;

(d) Adjourn any meeting when he or she determines it to be in the public interest; and

(e) Chair the meeting when so directed by the agency head.

####### § 102-3.125 How should agencies consider the roles of advisory committee members and staff?

FACA does not assign any specific responsibilities to members of advisory committees and staff, although both perform critical roles in achieving the goals and objectives assigned to advisory committees. Agency heads, Committee Management Officers (CMOs), and Designated Federal Officers (DFOs) should consider the distinctions between these roles and how they relate to each other in the development of agency guidelines implementing the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee Management part. In general, these guidelines should reflect:

(a)Clear operating procedures should provide for the conduct of advisory committee meetings and other activities, and specify the relationship among the advisory committee members, the DFO, and advisory committee or agency staff;

(b)In addition to compliance with the Act, advisory committee members and staff may be required to adhere to additional agency operating policies; and

(c)Other agency-specific statutes and regulations may affect the agency's advisory committees directly or indirectly. Agencies should ensure that advisory committee members and staff understand these requirements.

####### § 102-3.130 What policies apply to the appointment, and compensation or reimbursement of advisory committee members, staff, and experts and consultants?

In developing guidelines to implement the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee Management part at the agency level, agency heads must address the following issues concerning advisory committee member and staff appointments, and considerations with respect to uniform fair rates of compensation for comparable services, or expense reimbursement of members, staff, and experts and consultants:

(a)Unless otherwise provided by statute, Presidential directive, or other establishment authority, advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting authority.

(b)Each agency head must establish uniform compensation guidelines for members and staff of, and experts and consultants to an advisory committee.

(c)Nothing in this subpart requires an agency head to provide compensation to any member of an advisory committee, unless otherwise required by a specific statute.

(d)When an agency has authority to set pay administratively for advisory committee members, it may establish appropriate rates of pay (including any applicable locality pay authorized by the President's Pay Agent under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)), not to exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5315, unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by another statute. However, the agency head personally must authorize a rate of basic pay in excess of the maximum rate of basic pay established for the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, or alternative similar agency compensation system. This maximum rate includes any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304. The agency may pay advisory committee members on either an hourly or a daily rate basis. The agency may not provide additional compensation in any form, such as bonuses or premium pay.

(e)When an agency has authority to set pay administratively for advisory committee staff, it may establish appropriate rates of pay (including any applicable locality pay authorized by the President's Pay Agent under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)), not to exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5315, unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by another statute. However, the agency head personally must authorize a rate of basic pay in excess of the maximum rate of basic pay established for the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, or alternative similar agency compensation system. This maximum rate includes any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304. The agency must pay advisory committee staff on an hourly rate basis. The agency may provide additional compensation, such as bonuses or premium pay, so long as aggregate compensation paid in a calendar year does not exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule, with appropriate proration for a partial calendar year.

(f)In establishing rates of pay for advisory committee members and staff, the agency must comply with any applicable statutes, Executive orders, regulations, or administrative guidelines. In determining an appropriate rate of basic pay for advisory committee members and staff, an agency must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned, and the qualifications required for the work involved. The agency also should take into account the rates of pay applicable to Federal employees who have duties that are similar in terms of difficulty and responsibility. An agency may establish rates of pay for advisory committee staff based on the pay these persons would receive if they were covered by the General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51 and Chapter 53, subchapter III, or by an alternative similar agency compensation system.

(g)Whether or not an agency has other authority to appoint and compensate advisory committee members or staff, it also may employ experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 to perform work for an advisory committee. Compensation of experts and consultants may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay established for the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332 (that is, the GS&#x2013;15, step 10 rate, excluding locality pay or any other supplement), unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by another statute. The appointment and compensation of experts and consultants by an agency must be in conformance with applicable regulations issued by the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (See 5 CFR part 304.).

(h)Any advisory committee member or staff person who is a Federal employee when assigned duties to an advisory committee remains covered during the assignment by the compensation system that currently applies to that employee, unless that person's current Federal appointment is terminated. Any staff person who is a Federal employee must serve with the knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer (DFO) for the advisory committee to which that person is assigned duties, and the approval of the employee's direct supervisor.

(i)An individual who is appointed as an advisory committee member or staff person immediately following termination of another Federal appointment with a full-time work schedule may receive compensation at the rate applicable to the former appointment, if otherwise allowed by applicable law (without regard to the limitations on pay established in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section). Any advisory committee staff person who is not a current Federal employee serving under an assignment must be appointed in accordance with applicable agency procedures, and in consultation with the DFO and the members of the advisory committee involved.

(j)In the absence of any special limitations applicable to a specific agency, nothing in this subpart prevents an agency from accepting the gratuitous services of an advisory committee member or staff person who is not a Federal employee, or expert or consultant, who agrees in advance and in writing to serve without compensation.

(k)Advisory committee members and staff, while engaged in the performance of their duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be allowed reimbursement for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703, for persons employed intermittently in the Government service.

(l)While performing advisory committee duties, an advisory committee member with disabilities may be provided services by a personal assistant for employees with disabilities, if the member qualifies as an individual with disabilities as provided in section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791, and does not otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102 by reason of being a Federal employee.

####### § 102-3.155 How are advisory committee meetings closed to the public?

To close all or part of an advisory committee meeting, the Designated Federal Officer (DFO) must:

(a)Submit a request to the agency head, or in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the Secretariat, citing the specific exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), that justify the closure. The request must provide the agency head or the Secretariat sufficient time (generally, 30 calendar days) to review the matter in order to make a determination before publication of the meeting notice required by § 102&#x2013;3.150.

(b)The General Counsel of the agency or, in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the General Counsel of GSA should review all requests to close meetings.

(c)If the agency head, or in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the Secretariat, finds that the request is consistent with the provisions in the Government in the Sunshine Act and FACA, the appropriate agency official must issue a determination that all or part of the meeting be closed.

(d)The agency head or the chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must make a copy of the determination available to the public upon request.

Section 10(b) of the Act provides for the contemporaneous availability of advisory committee records that, when taken in conjunction with the ability to attend committee meetings, provide a meaningful opportunity to comprehend fully the work undertaken by the advisory committee. Although advisory committee records may be withheld under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended, if there is athat the records sought fall within the exemptions contained in section 552(b) of FOIA, agencies may not require members of the public or other interested parties to file requests for non-exempt advisory committee records under the request and review process established by section 552(a)(3) of FOIA.

Chapter 22.

###### Subpart E - How Does This Subpart Apply to Advice or Recommendations Provided to Agencies by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration?

####### § 102-3.180 What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

This subpart provides guidance to agencies on compliance with section 15 of the Act. Section 15 establishes requirements that apply only in connection with a funding or other written agreement involving an agency's use of advice or recommendations provided to the agency by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), if such advice or recommendations were developed by use of a committee created by either academy. For purposes of this subpart, NAS also includes the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council. Except with respect to NAS committees that were the subject of judicial actions filed before December 17, 1997, no part of the Act other than section 15 applies to any committee created by NAS or NAPA.

####### § 102-3.185 What does this subpart require agencies to do?

(a)An agency may not use any advice or recommendation provided to an agency by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) under an agreement between the agency and an academy, if such advice or recommendation was developed by use of a committee created by either academy, unless:

(1) The committee was not subject to any actual management or control by an agency or officer of the Federal Government; and

(2) In the case of NAS, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of section 15(b) of the Act; or

(3) In the case of NAPA, the academy certifies that it has complied substantially with the requirements of sections 15(b) (1), (2), and (5) of the Act.

(b)Agencies must not manage or control the specific procedures adopted by each academy to comply with the requirements of section 15 of the Act that are applicable to that academy. In addition, however, any committee created and used by an academy in the development of any advice or recommendation to be provided by the academy to an agency must be subject to both actual management and control by that academy and not by the agency.

(c)Agencies may enter into contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with NAS or NAPA that are consistent with the requirements of this subpart to obtain advice or recommendations from such academy. These funding agreements require, and agencies may rely upon, a written certification by an authorized representative of the academy provided to the agency upon delivery to the agency of each report containing advice or recommendations required under the agreement that:

(1) The academy has adopted policies and procedures that comply with the applicable requirements of section 15 of the Act; and

(2) To the best of the authorized representative's knowledge and belief, these policies and procedures substantially have been complied with in performing the work required under the agreement.

###### § 102-35.20 What definitions apply to GSA's personal property regulations?

The following are definitions of, or cross-references to, some key terms that apply to GSA's personal property regulations in the FMR (CFR parts 102&#x2013;36 through 102&#x2013;42). Other personal property terms are defined in the sections or parts to which they primarily apply.

includes nonexpendable personal property whose expected useful life is two years or longer and whose acquisition value, as determined by the agency, warrants tracking in the agency's property records, including capitalized and sensitive personal property.

means the ability to account for personal property by providing a complete audit trail for property transactions from receipt to final disposition.

means the original purchase price of an item.

includes property that is entered on the agency's general ledger records as a major investment or asset. An agency must determine its capitalization thresholds as discussed in Financial Accounting Standard Advisory Board (FASAB) Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 6 Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment, Chapter 1, paragraph 13.

means the ongoing function of maintaining physical oversight and surveillance of personal property throughout its complete life cycle using various property management tools and techniques taking into account the environment in which the property is located and its vulnerability to theft, waste, fraud, or abuse.

(see § 102&#x2013;36.40 of this subchapter B).

(see § 102&#x2013;39.20 of this subchapter B).

(see § 102&#x2013;36.40 of this subchapter B).

(see § 102&#x2013;36.40 of this subchapter B).

(see § 102&#x2013;41.20 of this subchapter B).

includes a formal listing of all accountable property items assigned to an agency, along with a formal process to verify the condition, location, and quantity of such items. This term may also be used as a verb to indicate the actions leading to the development of a listing. In this sense, an inventory must be conducted using an actual physical count, electronic means, and/or statistical methods.

means an official, designated in accordance with § 102&#x2013;36.45(b) of this subchapter B, who is responsible for ensuring effective acquisition, use, and disposal of excess property within your agency.

(see § 102&#x2013;36.40 of this subchapter B).

means the system of acquiring, maintaining, using and disposing of the personal property of an organization or entity.

means personal property that has been confiscated by a Federal agency, and whose care and handling will be the responsibility of that agency until final ownership is determined by the judicial process.

includes all items, regardless of value, that require special control and accountability due to unusual rates of loss, theft or misuse, or due to national security or export control considerations. Such property includes weapons, ammunition, explosives, information technology equipment with memory capability, cameras, and communications equipment. These classifications do not preclude agencies from specifying additional personal property classifications to effectively manage their programs.

(see § 102&#x2013;37.25 of this subchapter B).

means the identification, reporting, and transfer of excess personal property among Federal agencies.

###### § 102-35.25 What management reports must we provide?

(d) Government-owned personal property may only be used as authorized by your agency. Title to Government-owned personal property cannot be transferred to a non-Federal entity unless through official procedures specifically authorized by law.

##### PART 102-36 - DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PERSONAL PROPERTY

###### Subpart A - General Provisions

####### § 102-36.5 What is the governing authority for this part?

Section 121(c) of title 40, United States Code, authorizes the Administrator of General Services to prescribe regulations as he deems necessary to carry out his functions under subtitle I of title 40. Section 521 of title 40 authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to prescribe policies to promote the maximum use of excess Government personal property by executive agencies.

####### § 102-36.10 What does this part cover?

This part covers the acquisition, transfer, and disposal, by executive agencies, of excess personal property located in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

####### § 102-36.15 Who must comply with the provisions of this part?

All executive agencies must comply with the provisions of this part. The legislative and judicial branches are encouraged to report and transfer excess personal property and fill their personal property requirements from excess in accordance with these provisions.

####### § 102-36.20 To whom do “we”, “you”, and their variants refer?

Use of pronouns “we”, “you”, and their variants throughout this part refer to the agency.

####### § 102-36.25 How do we request a deviation from these requirements and who can approve it?

See §§ 102&#x2013;2.60 through 102&#x2013;2.110 of this chapter to request a deviation from the requirements of this part.

####### § 102-36.30 When is personal property excess?

Personal property is excess when it is no longer needed by the activities within your agency to carry out the functions of official programs, as determined by the agency head or designee.

####### § 102-36.35 What is the typical process for disposing of excess personal property?

(a) You must ensure personal property not needed by your activity is offered for use elsewhere within your agency. If the property is no longer needed by any activity within your agency, your agency declares the property excess and reports it to GSA for possible transfer to eligible recipients, including federal agencies for direct use or for use by their contractors, project grantees, or cooperative agreement recipients. All executive agencies must, to the maximum extent practicable, fill requirements for personal property by using existing agency property or by obtaining excess property from other federal agencies in lieu of new procurements.

(b) If GSA determines that there are no federal requirements for your excess personal property, it becomes surplus property and is available for donation to state and local public agencies and other eligible non-federal activities. Title 40 of the United States Code requires that surplus personal property be distributed to eligible recipients by an agency established by each State for this purpose, the State Agency for Surplus Property.

(c) Surplus personal property not selected for donation is offered for sale to the public by competitive offerings such as sealed bid sales, spot bid sales, or auctions. You may conduct or contract for the sale of your surplus personal property, or have GSA or another executive agency conduct the sale on behalf of your agency in accordance with part 102&#x2013;38 of this chapter. You must inform GSA at the time the property is reported as excess if you do not want GSA to conduct the sale for you.

(d) If a written determination is made that the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, you may dispose of the property by abandonment or destruction, or donate it to public bodies.

###### Subpart B - Acquiring Excess Personal Property For Our Agency

###### Subpart C - Acquiring Excess Personal Property for Non-Federal Recipients

####### § 102-36.150 For which non-federal activities may we acquire excess personal property?

Under the Property Act you may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by your non-appropriated fund activities, contractors, cooperatives, and project grantees. You may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by other eligible recipients only when you have specific statutory authority to do so.

####### § 102-36.155 What are our responsibilities when acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-federal recipient?

When acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-federal recipient, your authorized agency official must:

(a) Ensure the use of excess personal property by the non-federal recipient is authorized and complies with applicable federal regulations and agency guidelines.

(b) Determine that the use of excess personal property will reduce the costs to the government and/or that it is in the government's best interest to furnish excess personal property.

(c) Review and approve transfer documents for excess personal property as the sponsoring Federal agency.

(d) Ensure the non-federal recipient is aware of his obligations under the FMR and your agency regulations regarding the management of excess personal property.

(e) Ensure the non-federal recipient does not stockpile the property but places the property into use within a reasonable period of time, and has a system to prevent nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal or destruction of excess personal property furnished.

(f) Establish provisions and procedures for property accountability and disposition in situations when the government retains title.

(g) Report annually to GSA excess personal property furnished to non-federal recipients during the year (see § 102&#x2013;36.295).

####### § 102-36.160 What additional information must we provide on the SF 122 when acquiring excess personal property for non-federal recipients?

Annotate on the SF 122, the name of the non-federal recipient and the contract, grant or agreement number, when applicable, and the scheduled completion/expiration date of the contract, grant or agreement. If the remaining time prior to the expiration date is less than 60 calendar days, you must certify that the contract, grant or agreement will be extended or renewed or provide other written justification for the transfer.

###### Subpart D - Disposition of Excess Personal Property

####### § 102-36.210 Why must we report excess personal property to GSA?

You must report excess personal property to promote reuse by the government to enable federal agencies to benefit from the continued use of property already paid for with taxpayers' money, thus minimizing new procurement costs. Reporting excess personal property to GSA helps assure that the information on available excess personal property is accessible and disseminated to the widest range of reuse customers.

###### Subpart E - Personal Property Whose Disposal Requires Special Handling

####### § 102-36.335 Are there certain types of excess personal property that must be disposed of differently from normal disposal procedures?

Yes, you must comply with the additional provisions in this subpart when disposing of the types of personal property listed in this subpart.

###### Subpart F - Miscellaneous Disposition

####### § 102-36.475 What is the authority for transfers under “Computers for Learning”?

(a) The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), authorizes federal agencies to transfer excess education-related federal equipment to educational institutions or nonprofit organizations for educational and research activities. Executive Order 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180) requires, to the extent permitted by law and where appropriate, the transfer of computer equipment for use by schools or nonprofit organizations.

(b) Each federal agency is required to identify a point of contact within the agency to assist eligible recipients, and to publicize the availability of such property to eligible communities. Excess education-related equipment may be transferred directly under established agency procedures, or reported to GSA as excess for subsequent transfer to potential eligible recipients as appropriate. You must include transfers under this authority in the annual Non-federal Recipients Report (See § 102&#x2013;36.295) to GSA.

(c) The “Computers for Learning” website has been developed to streamline the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to schools and nonprofit educational organizations. For additional information about this program access the “Computers for Learning” website,

####### § 102-37.595 When transferring donated surplus vehicles, what is the responsibility of the donee?

The donee is responsible for processing the SF 97 in accordance with state licensing and titling authorities. The donee signs the SF 97 as “transferee” upon receipt of the surplus motor vehicle. The donee is responsible for notifying the SASP if a SF 97 is not provided by the Government.

####### § 102-37.600 When does title to a surplus donated vehicle change hands?

Yes, State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) must follow the regulations in this part when conducting sales on behalf of the General Services Administration of Government personal property in their custody.

###### Subpart H - Implementation of the Federal Asset Sales Program

####### § 102-38.360 What must an executive agency do to implement the eFAS program?

(a) An executive agency must review the effectiveness of all sales solutions, and compare them to the effectiveness (e.g., cost, level of service, and value added services) of the eFAS SCs. Agencies should give full consideration to sales solutions utilizing private sector entities, including small businesses, that are more effective than the solutions provided by any eFAS-approved SC. If the agency decides that there are more effective sales solutions than those solutions offered by the eFAS SCs, the agency must request a waiver from the milestones using the procedures and forms provided by the eFAS Planning Office. Waivers will be approved by the eFAS Planning Office upon presentation of a business case showing that complying with an eFAS milestone is either impracticable or inefficient. Waiver approval will be coordinated with GSA's Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management. Contact the eFAS Planning Office atto obtain these procedures and forms.

(b) An approved waiver for meeting one of the eFAS milestones does not automatically waive all milestone requirements. For example, if an agency receives a waiver to the migration milestone, the agency must still (1) post asset information on the eFAS Web site and (2) provide post-sales data to the eFAS Planning Office in accordance with the content and format requirements developed by the eFAS ESC, unless waivers to these milestones are also requested and approved. Waivers to the eFAS milestones will not be permanent. Upon expiration of the waiver to the migration milestone, an agency must either migrate to an approved SC, or serve as a fully functioning SC, as soon as practicable. See the definition of a “Sales Center” at § 102&#x2013;38.35 for an overview of how agency sales solutions become SCs.

(c) An agency which receives a waiver from the eFAS milestones must comply with subparts A through G of this part as if it were an SC.

(d) An executive agency must comply with all eFAS milestones approved by OMB including those regarding the completion of an agency-wide sales migration plan, the reporting of pre- and post-sales data, and the migration to approved SCs unless a waiver has been submitted by the agency and approved by the eFAS Planning Office. The eFAS milestones are available for viewing at

####### § 102-38.365 Is a holding agency required to report property in “scrap” condition to its selected SC?

No. Property which has no value except for its basic material content (scrap material) may be disposed of by the holding agency by sale or as otherwise provided in § 102&#x2013;38.70. However, the holding agency should consult the SC(s) selected by the holding agency as to the feasibility of selling the scrap material. Agencies selling scrap property under authority of this subpart are still required to report sales metrics in accordance with eFAS ESC-approved format and content.

####### § 102-38.370 What does a holding agency do with property which cannot be sold by its SC?

All reasonable efforts must be afforded the SC to sell the property. If the property remains unsold after the time frame agreed to between the SC and the holding agency, the holding agency may dispose of the property by sale or as otherwise provided in § 102&#x2013;38.70. The lack of public interest in buying the property is evidence that the sales proceeds would be minimal. Agencies selling property under authority of this subpart are still required to report sales metrics in accordance with eFAS ESC-approved format and content.

##### PART 102-39 - REPLACEMENT OF PERSONAL PROPERTY PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE/SALE AUTHORITY

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 102-39.5 What is the exchange/sale authority?

The exchange/sale authority is a statutory provision, (40 U.S.C. 503), which states in part: “In acquiring personal property, an executive agency may exchange or sell similar items and may apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the property acquired.”

####### § 102-39.10 What does this part cover?

This part covers the exchange/sale authority, and applies to all personal property owned by executive agencies worldwide. For the exchange/sale of aircraft parts and hazardous materials, you must meet the requirements in this part and in parts 101&#x2013;33 and 101&#x2013;42 of this title.

####### § 102-39.15 How are the terms “I” and “you” used in this part?

Use of pronouns “I” and “you” throughout this part refer to executive agencies.

####### § 102-39.20 What definitions apply to this part?

The following definitions apply to this part:

means to procure or otherwise obtain personal property, including by lease (sometimes known as rent).

means arms, ammunition, and implements of war listed in the U.S. munitions list (22 CFR part 121).

means any personal property under the control of any Federal agency that is no longer required for that agency's needs or responsibilities, as determined by the agency head or designee.

means to replace personal property by trade or trade-in with the supplier of the replacement property.

means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus personal property and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in whole or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property.

means any executive department or independent establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including any wholly owned Government corporation.

means any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under his/her direction).

means property having added value for display purposes because its historical significance is greater than its fair market value for continued use. Items that are commonly available and remain in use for their intended purpose, such as military aircraft still in use by active or reserve units, are not historic items.

means the process of acquiring personal property to be used in place of personal property that is still needed but:

(1) No longer adequately performs the tasks for which it is used; or

(2) Does not meet the agency's need as well as the personal property to be acquired.

means the modification of a personal property item undertaken to extend the life of the item beyond that which was previously planned. SLEPs extend capital asset life by retrofit, major modification, remanufacturing, betterment, or enhancement.

means the acquired item(s) and replaced item(s):

(1) Are identical; or

(2) Fall within a single Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group of property (includes any and all forms of property within a single FSC Group); or

(3) Are parts or containers for similar end items; or

(4) Are designed or constructed for the same purpose (includes any and all forms of property regardless of the FSC Group to which they are assigned).

means excess personal property not required for the needs of any Federal agency, as determined by GSA under part 102&#x2013;37 of this chapter.

####### § 102-39.25 Which exchange/sale provisions are subject to deviation?

All of the provisions in this part are subject to deviation (upon presentation of adequate justification) except those mandated by statute. See the link on “Exchange/Sale” atfor additional information on requesting deviations from this part.

####### § 102-39.30 How do I request a deviation from this part?

See part 102&#x2013;2 of this chapter (41 CFR part 102&#x2013;2) to request a deviation from the requirements of this part.

###### Subpart B - Exchange/Sale Considerations

####### § 102-39.35 When should I consider using the exchange/sale authority?

You should consider using the exchange/sale authority when replacing personal property.

####### § 102-39.40 Why should I consider using the exchange/sale authority?

You should consider using the exchange/sale authority to reduce the cost of replacement personal property. When you have personal property that is wearing out or obsolete and must be replaced, you should consider either exchanging or selling that property and using the exchange allowance or sales proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement personal property. Conversely, if you choose not to replace the property using the exchange/sale authority, you may declare it as excess and dispose of it through the normal disposal process as addressed in part 102&#x2013;36 of this chapter. Keep in mind, however, that any net proceeds from the eventual sale of that property as surplus generally must be forwarded to the miscellaneous receipts account at the United States Treasury and thus would not be available to you. You may use the exchange/sale authority in the acquisition of personal property even if the acquisition is under a services contract, as long as the property acquired under the services contract is similar to the property exchanged or sold (e.g., for a SLEP, exchange allowances or sales proceeds would be available for replacement of similar items, but not for services).

####### § 102-39.45 When should I not use the exchange/sale authority?

You should not use the exchange/sale authority if the exchange allowance or estimated sales proceeds for the property will be unreasonably low. You must either abandon or destroy such property, or declare the property excess, in accordance with part 102&#x2013;36 of this chapter. Further, you must not use the exchange/sale authority if the transaction(s) would violate any other applicable statute or regulation.

####### § 102-39.50 How do I determine whether to do an exchange or a sale?

You must determine whether an exchange or sale will provide the greater return for the Government. When estimating the return under each method, consider all related administrative and overhead costs.

####### § 102-39.55 When should I offer property I am exchanging or selling under the exchange/sale authority to other Federal agencies or State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASP)?

If you have property to replace which is eligible for exchange/sale, you should first, to the maximum extent practicable, solicit:

(a) Federal agencies known to use or distribute such property. If a Federal agency is interested in acquiring and paying for the property, you should arrange for a reimbursable transfer. Reimbursable transfers may also be conducted with the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Architect of the Capitol and any activities under the Architect's direction, the District of Columbia, and mixed-ownership Government corporations. When conducting a reimbursable transfer, you must:

(1) Do so under terms mutually agreeable to you and the recipient.

(2) Not require reimbursement of an amount greater than the estimated fair market value of the transferred property.

(3) Apply the transfer proceeds in whole or part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property; and

(b) State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) known to have an interest in acquiring such property. If a SASP is interested in acquiring the property, you should consider selling it to the SASP by negotiated sale at fixed price under the conditions specified at § 102&#x2013;38.125 of this title. The sales proceeds must be applied in whole or part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property.

####### § 102-39.60 What restrictions and prohibitions apply to the exchange/sale of personal property?

Unless a deviation is requested of and approved by GSA as addressed in part 102&#x2013;2 of this chapter and the provisions of §§ 102&#x2013;39.25 and 102&#x2013;39.30, you must not use the exchange/sale authority for:

(a) The following FSC groups of personal property:

10 Weapons.

11 Nuclear ordnance.

42 Firefighting, rescue, and safety equipment.

44 Nuclear reactors (FSC Class 4470 only).

51 Hand tools.

54 Prefabricated structure and scaffolding (FSC Class 5410 Prefabricated and Portable Buildings, FSC Class 5411 Rigid Wall Shelters, and FSC Class 5419 Collective Modular Support System only).

68 Chemicals and chemical products, except medicinal chemicals.

84 Clothing, individual equipment, and insignia.

(b) Materials in the National Defense Stockpile (50 U.S.C. 98&#x2013;98h) or the Defense Production Act inventory (50 U.S.C. App. 2093).

(c) Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials unless you meet the requirements of § 101&#x2013;42.1102&#x2013;4 of this title.

(d) Controlled substances, unless you meet the requirements of § 101&#x2013;42.1102&#x2013;3 of this title.

(e) Property with a condition code of scrap, as defined at FMR 102&#x2013;36.40, except:

(1) Property that had utility and value at the point in time when a determination was made to use the exchange/sale authority;

(2) Property that was otherwise eligible for exchange/sale, but was coded as scrap due to damage (e.g., accident or natural disaster); or

(3) Scrap gold for fine gold.

(f) Property that was originally acquired as excess or forfeited property or from another source other than new procurement, unless such property has been in official use by the acquiring agency for at least 1 year. You may exchange or sell forfeited property in official use for less than 1 year if the head of your agency determines that a continuing valid requirement exists, but the specific item in use no longer meets that requirement, and that exchange or sale meets all other requirements of this part.

(g) Property that is dangerous to public health or safety without first rendering such property innocuous or providing for adequate safeguards as part of the exchange/sale.

(h) Combat material without demilitarizing it or obtaining a demilitarization waiver or other necessary clearances from the Department of Defense Demilitarization Office.

(i) Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP) and Critical Safety Items (CSI) unless you meet the provisions of § 102&#x2013;33.370 of this title.

(j) Acquisition of unauthorized replacement property.

(k) Acquisition of replacement property that violates any:

(1) Restriction on procurement of a commodity or commodities;

(2) Replacement policy or standard prescribed by the President, the Congress, or the Administrator of General Services; or

(3) Contractual obligation.

(l) Vessels subject to 40 U.S.C. 548.

(m) Aircraft and aircraft parts, unless there is full compliance with all exchange/sale provisions in part 102&#x2013;33 of this chapter (41 CFR part 102&#x2013;33).

####### § 102-39.65 What conditions apply to the exchange/sale of personal property?

You may use the exchange/sale authority only if you meet all of the following conditions:

(a) The property exchanged or sold is similar to the property acquired;

(b) The property exchanged or sold is not excess or surplus and you have a continuing need for similar property;

(c) The property exchanged or sold was not acquired for the principal purpose of exchange or sale;

(d) When replacing personal property, the exchange allowance or sales proceeds from the disposition of that property may only be used to offset the cost of the replacement property, not services; and

(e) Except for transactions involving books and periodicals in your libraries, you document the basic facts associated with each exchange/sale transaction. At a minimum, the documentation must include:

(1) The FSC Group of the items exchanged or sold, and the items acquired;

(2) The number of items exchanged or sold, and the number of items acquired;

(3) The acquisition cost and exchange allowance or net sales proceeds of the items exchanged or sold, and the acquisition cost of the items acquired;

(4) The date of the transaction(s);

(5) The parties involved; and

(6) A statement that the transactions comply with the requirements of this part 102&#x2013;39.

###### Subpart C - Exchange/Sale Methods and Reports

####### § 102-39.70 What are the exchange methods?

Exchange of property may be accomplished by either of the following methods:

(a) The supplier (e.g., a Government agency, commercial or private organization, or an individual) delivers the replacement property to one of your organizational units and removes the property being replaced from that same organizational unit.

(b) The supplier delivers the replacement property to one of your organizational units and removes the property being replaced from a different organizational unit.

####### § 102-39.75 What are the sales methods?

(a) You must use the methods, terms, and conditions of sale, and the forms prescribed in part 102&#x2013;38 of this title, in the sale of property being replaced, except for the provisions of §§ 102&#x2013;38.100 through 102&#x2013;38.115 of this title regarding negotiated sales. Section 3709, Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), specifies the following conditions under which property being replaced can be sold by negotiation, subject to obtaining such competition as is feasible:

(1) The reasonable value involved in the contract does not exceed $500; or

(2) Otherwise authorized by law.

(b) You may sell property being replaced by negotiation at fixed prices in accordance with the provisions of § 102&#x2013;38.120 and 102&#x2013;38.125 of this title.

####### § 102-39.80 What are the accounting requirements for exchange allowances or proceeds of sale?

Except as otherwise authorized by law, all exchange allowances or proceeds of sale under this part will be available during the fiscal year in which the property was exchanged or sold and for one fiscal year thereafter for the purchase of replacement property. Any proceeds of sale not applied to replacement purchases during this time must be deposited in the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

####### § 102-39.85 What information am I required to report?

(a) You must submit, within 90 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, a summary report in a format of your choice on the exchange/sale transactions made under this part during the fiscal year (except for transactions involving books and periodicals in your libraries).

##### PART 102-40 - UTILIZATION AND DISPOSITION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WITH SPECIAL HANDLING REQUIREMENTS

###### Subpart A - General Provisions

####### § 102-40.5 What does this part cover?

This part provides guidance regarding the utilization, transfer, donation, sale, and other disposal of Government personal property with special handling requirements (hazardous materials, dangerous property, etc.) located in the United States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. For guidance regarding the disposal of personal property located outside of these areas, see §§ 102&#x2013;36.380 through 102&#x2013;36.400 of this subchapter; however, the disposal of personal property located outside of these areas should conform to the provisions in this part, whenever feasible, in the interest of promoting safety, security, and environmental stewardship.

####### § 102-40.10 What is the governing authority for this part?

40 U.S.C. 121(c) authorizes the Administrator of General Services to prescribe regulations necessary to perform functions under this part.

####### § 102-40.15 Who must comply with the provisions in this part?

All executive agencies must comply with the provisions of this part unless authorized by specific, separate statutory authority to do otherwise. Also, pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 549(b)(1), state agencies for surplus property (SASPs) must comply with the provisions of this part related to the donation of surplus property with special handling requirements. Legislative and judicial agencies are encouraged to follow these provisions.

####### § 102-40.20 To whom do “we,” “you,” and their variants refer?

The pronouns “we,” “you,” and their variants throughout this part refer to the executive agency, or other entity using these regulations, unless otherwise indicated.

####### § 102-40.25 How do we request a deviation from these requirements and who can approve it?

See §§ 102&#x2013;2.60 through 102&#x2013;2.110 of this chapter to request a deviation from the requirements of this part.

###### Subpart B - Responsibilities

####### § 102-40.35 What types of personal property require special handling?

Personal property requiring special handling includes property containing hazardous materials or property which exhibits dangerous characteristics such that improper use, storage, transportation or disposal may lead to potential safety, health, environmental, economic, or national security risks. In many situations, the use, storage, transportation or disposal of these items is governed by Federal, state, and local laws. Personal property requiring special handling may also include animals and plants which may perish if not handled appropriately, as well as perishable products that may lose their utility if not handled appropriately.

####### § 102-40.40 What are our responsibilities concerning personal property requiring special handling?

You are responsible for&#x2014;

(a) Identifying and accounting for property with special handling requirements;

(b) Complying with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the handling, storage, labeling, use, and final disposition of such property;

(c) Ensuring adequate storage and safeguarding of such property,secured or limited access storage areas, warning signs, and protective clothing and equipment; and

(d) Transporting materials requiring special handling in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT), EPA, state and local regulations.

####### § 102-40.45 What must we do when we have identified personal property with special handling requirements?

You must properly mark, tag, or label personal property with special handling requirements in accordance with applicable Federal law, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements (29 CFR 1910.1200), regarding the actual or potential hazard associated with the property, and ensure that such information is maintained and perpetuated in the official agency property records. Labeling requirements for substances that are excluded from the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200 are found in the references listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) and (6).

####### § 102-40.50 What must we do when we no longer need personal property with special handling requirements?

Except for the items listed in § 102&#x2013;40.55, you must report excess personal property with special handling requirements that you no longer need to GSA for Federal and donation screening (see § 102&#x2013;36.215 of this subchapter for how to report excess personal property to GSA). The report to GSA must clearly identify property requiring special handling, and all related hazards, precautions, and handling requirements related to this property. You must dispose of property not required to be reported to GSA in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and your agency procedures. See § 102&#x2013;40.125 for policy regarding disposal of property requiring special handling by abandonment or destruction. Disposal must be accomplished so as to preserve as much as possible, any civilian utility or commercial value of the property.

####### § 102-40.55 Do we report all excess personal property with special handling requirements to GSA?

No. Because of their characteristics, certain items are not subject to the usual disposal procedures. You are not required to report to GSA excess personal property with special handling requirements in any of the following categories listed below.

(a)You must dispose of extremely hazardous personal property not reported to GSA in accordance with applicable demilitarization requirements, EPA regulations, state and local laws or regulations, and other Federal laws, regulations or guidelines. However, if time and circumstances permit, this material may be reported to GSA to optimize use of this already-acquired material. When an item that is determined to be extremely hazardous property becomes excess, the holding agency should notify the appropriate GSA regional personal property office, which will determine if the property should be reported using Report of Excess Personal Property, Standard Form (SF) 120 or another method. At a minimum, you must identify the item, and describe the actual or potential hazard(s) associated with the handling, storage, or use of the item(s). This GSA regional office will determine the utilization, donation, sales or other disposal requirements, and provide appropriate guidance to the holding agency.

(b)You must dispose of hazardous wastes not reported to GSA in accordance with applicable demilitarization requirements, EPA regulations, state and local laws or regulations, and other Federal laws, regulations or guidelines.

(f) Friable asbestos materials that contain more than one percent asbestos by weight and can, by hand pressure, be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder, thus allowing for potential release of asbestos fibers into the air. Property containing friable asbestos normally is not to be transferred, donated or sold. Notwithstanding these provisions, holding agencies, on a case-by-case basis, may request approval from GSA Central Office, with consultation from the EPA, to transfer, donate or sell such property if in the judgment of the holding agency, special circumstances warrant such action.

(g) Excess personal property known to contain friable asbestos shall neither be reported to GSA nor transferred among Federal agencies excepted as noted in paragraph (f) of this section.

(h) Surplus property containing friable asbestos is to be neither donated nor sold. Such property is disposed of under paragraph (i) of this section.

(i) Excess and surplus property containing friable asbestos is to be disposed of by burial in a site that meets the EPA requirements of 40 CFR 61.156.

The following certification, or an equivalent certification, must be used and retained by the Federal agency or SASP to document the destruction of drugs, biologicals, and reagents:

(c) When donating drugs, biologicals, or reagents other than controlled substances, the SASP shall obtain a certification from the donee indicating that the items donated will be safeguarded, dispensed, and administered under competent supervision and in accordance with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents requested for donation by state agencies will not be transported by the state agency or stored in its warehouse prior to distribution to donees. Arrangements will be made by the state agency for the donee to make direct pickup at the holding agency after approval by GSA and after notification by the holding agency that the property is ready for pickup. Additionally, Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property, SF 123 from a state agency requesting surplus drugs, biologicals, and reagents for donation will not be processed or approved by GSA until it has been determined by the GSA donation representative that the specific donee is legally licensed to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property. A copy of the donee's license, registration, or other legal authorization to administer, dispense, store, or distribute such property should be attached and made a part of the SF 123. The administration or use of drugs, biologicals, and reagents must be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301,).

(a) You must submit reports and transfer documents on excess firearms to GSA (8QSC), Denver, CO 80225&#x2013;0506. GSA will approve transfers of firearms only to those Federal agencies authorized to acquire firearms for official use, and may require additional written justification from the requesting agency.

(b) GSA may donate only surplus hand guns, rifles, shotguns, and individual light automatic weapons previously used by the Federal Government, with less than .50 caliber in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) 1005, and rifle and shoulder fired grenade launchers in FSC 1010, with a disposal condition code of 4 or better (see condition codes in § 102&#x2013;36.240 of this subchapter). Only eligible law enforcement entities whose primary function is the enforcement of applicable Federal, state, and/or local laws, and whose compensated law enforcement officers have powers to apprehend and arrest, may obtain these donated firearms for law enforcement purposes.

(c)(1) For purposes of donation under paragraph (b) of this section, each Transfer Order Surplus Personal Property SF 123 must be accompanied by a conditional transfer document, signed by both the intended donee agency and the SASP, which includes the special terms, conditions, restrictions, and other forms or information required for the transfer of the donated firearms. Restrictions on donated firearms are perpetual and may not be amended by the SASP without prior written approval from GSA. Donated firearms must be released or shipped directly from the Federal donor agency to the designated donee.

(2) If the firearms to be donated are subject to the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53, (machineguns, silencers, short-barrel rifles, short-barrel shotguns, firearms over .50 caliber or with a bore diameter of more thaninch, and destructive devices) the SF 123 must be accompanied by an ATF Form 10, Application for Registration of Firearms Acquired by Certain Governmental Entities, completed by the donee agency as specified in 27 CFR 479.104. Upon approval of the donation by the SASP, the Form 10 shall be forwarded in accordance with the form's instructions. The Chief, National Firearms Act Branch, shall notify the donee agency of ATF registration of the donated firearms by returning the approved Form 10 to the donee agency. The donee agency shall provide a copy of the approved Form 10 to the SASP who shall retain a copy of the approved Form 10 and attach it to the SF 123. Firearms shall not be released for shipment until the ATF Form 10 has been approved by the ATF and a copy provided to the SASP. The registration of any firearms on ATF Form 10 is for official use only and subsequent transfers will be approved only to other Governmental entities for official use and in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If you have questions concerning whether particular firearms are subject to the National Firearms Act, contact the Firearms Technology Industry Services Branch, ATF, at (304) 616&#x2013;4300 or

(d) When authorized by circumstances described in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), or (i) of this section, the destruction of firearms must be performed by an entity authorized by your agency head or designee. The destruction must be witnessed by two additional agency employees authorized by the agency head or designee.

(e)(1) When the approved donee agency no longer needs the donated firearms, the donee agency must notify the SASP. The SASP may, with GSA approval and in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, reassign firearms to another donee agency within the state or to a donee agency in another state through the appropriate SASP. In such a case, transfer of the firearms must be between eligible donee agencies only. No SASP is eligible to take custody of the firearms. If the firearms are not sought for reassignment, the donee agency and a representative from the SASP, or designee, must witness destruction of the firearms and complete and sign a certificate of destruction, which will be maintained by the SASP. If firearms subject to the National Firearms Act are destroyed, the SASP shall notify the Chief, National Firearms Act Branch, ATF, so the destruction can be noted in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.

####### § 102-75.945 What is GSA's policy concerning the physical care, handling, protection, and maintenance of excess and surplus real property and related personal property?

GSA's policy is to&#x2014;

(a) Manage excess and surplus real property, including related personal property, by providing only those minimum services necessary to preserve the Government's interest and realizable value of the property considered;

(b) Place excess and surplus real property in productive use through interim utilization, provided, that such temporary use and occupancy do not interfere with, delay, or impede its transfer to a Federal agency or disposal; and

(a) Abandon or destroy Government-owned improvements and related personal property located on privately-owned land;

(b) Destroy Government-owned improvements and related personal property located on Government-owned land (abandonment of such property is not authorized); or

(c) Donate to public bodies any Government-owned real property (land and/or improvements and related personal property), or interests therein.

###### Subpart F - Delegations

###### Subpart G - Conditional Gifts of Real Property to Further the Defense Effort

####### § 102-75.1140 What is the policy governing the acceptance or rejection of a conditional gift of real property for a particular defense purpose?

Any Federal agency receiving an offer of a conditional gift of real property for a particular defense purpose within the purview of Chapter 582&#x2013;Public Law 537 (July 27, 1954) must notify the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office and must submit to GSA a recommendation indicating whether the Government should accept or reject the gift. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as applicable to the acceptance of gifts under the provisions of other laws. Following receipt of such notification and recommendation, GSA must&#x2014;

(a) Consult with the interested agencies before it may accept or reject such conditional gifts of real property on behalf of the United States or before it transfers such conditional gifts of real property to an agency; and

(b) Advise the donor and the agencies concerned of the action taken with respect to acceptance or rejection of the conditional gift and of its final disposition.

####### § 102-75.1145 What action must the Federal agency receiving an offer of a conditional gift take?

Prior to notifying the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office, the receiving Federal agency must acknowledge receipt of the offer in writing and advise the donor that the offer will be referred to the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office. The receiving agency must not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf of the United States at this time. The receiving agency must provide a copy of the acknowledgment with the notification and recommendation to the GSA regional property disposal office.

####### § 102-75.1150 What happens to the gift if GSA determines it to be acceptable?

When GSA determines that the gift is acceptable and can be accepted and used in the form in which it was offered, GSA must designate an agency and transfer the gift without reimbursement to this agency to use as the donor intended.

####### § 102-75.1155 May an acceptable gift of property be converted to money?

GSA can determine whether or not a gift of property can and should be converted to money. After conversion, GSA must deposit the funds with the Treasury Department for transfer to an appropriate account that will best effectuate the intent of the donor, in accordance with Treasury Department procedures.

###### Subpart H - Use of Federal Real Property to Assist the Homeless

###### Subpart I - Screening of Federal Real Property

####### § 102-75.1220 How do landholding agencies find out if excess Federal real property is available?

If agencies report excess real and related personal property to GSA, GSA conducts a “Federal screening” for the property. Federal screening consists of developing a “Notice of Availability” and circulating the “Notice” among all Federal landholding agencies for a maximum of 30 days.

####### § 102-75.1225 What details are provided in the “Notice of Availability”?

The “Notice of Availability” describes the physical characteristics of the property; it also provides information on location, hazards or restrictions, contact information, and a date by which an interested Federal agency must respond in writing to indicate a definite or potential need for the property.

####### § 102-75.1230 How long does an agency have to indicate its interest in the property?

Generally, agencies have 30 days to express written interest in the property. However, sometimes GSA has cause to conduct an expedited screening of the real property and the time allotted for responding is less than 30 days. The Notice of Availability always contains a “respond by” date.

####### § 102-75.1235 Where should an agency send its written response to the “Notice of Availability”?

Look for the contact information provided in the Notice of Availability. Most likely, an agency will be directed to contact one of GSA's regional offices.

####### § 102-75.1240 Who, from the interested landholding agency, should submit the written response to GSA's “Notice of Availability”?

An authorized official of the landholding agency must sign the written response to the Notice of Availability. An “authorized official” is one who is responsible for acquisition and/or disposal decisions (e.g., head of the agency or official designee).

####### § 102-75.1245 What happens after the landholding agency properly responds to a “Notice of Availability”?

The landholding agency has 60 days (from the expiration date of the “Notice of Availability”) to submit a formal transfer request for the property. Absent a formal request for transfer within the prescribed 60 days, GSA may, at its discretion, pursue other disposal options.

####### § 102-75.1250 What if the agency is not quite sure it wants the property and needs more time to decide?

If the written response to the “Notice of Availability” indicates a potential need, then the agency has an additional 30 days (from the expiration date of the “Notice of Availability”) to determine whether or not its has a definite requirement for the property, and then 60 days to submit a transfer request.

####### § 102-75.1255 What happens when more than one agency has a valid interest in the property?

GSA will attempt to facilitate an equitable solution between the agencies involved. However, the Administrator has final decision making authority in determining which requirement aligns with the Federal Government's best interests.

####### § 102-75.1260 Does GSA conduct Federal screening on every property reported as excess real property?

No. GSA may waive the Federal screening for excess real property when it determines that doing so is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

Below is a sample list of some of the factors GSA may consider when making the decision to waive Federal screening. This list is a representative sample and is not all-inclusive:

(a) There is a known Federal need;

(b) The property is located within the boundaries of tribal lands;

(c) The property has known disposal limitations precluding further Federal use (e.g., title and/or utilization restrictions; reported excess specifically for participation in the Relocation Program; reported excess for transfer to the current operating contractor who will continue production according to the terms of the disposal documents; directed for disposal by law or special legislation);

(d) The property will be transferred to a “potentially responsible party” (PRP) that stored, released, or disposed of hazardous substances at the Government-owned facility;

(e) The property is an easement;

(f) The excess property is actually a leasehold interest where there are Government-owned improvements with substantial value and cannot be easily removed;

(g) Government-owned improvements on Government-owned land, where the land is neither excess nor expected to become excess; or

(h) Screening for public benefit uses, except for the McKinney-Vento homeless screening, for specific property disposal considerations (see § 102&#x2013;75.351).

####### § 102-75.1265 Are extensions granted to the Federal screening and response timeframes?

Generally, no. GSA believes the timeframes are sufficient for agencies to make a decision and respond. Requests for extensions must be strongly justified and approved by the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator. For example, agencies may request an extension of time to submit their formal transfer request if they are not promptly provided GSA's estimate of FMV after submission of the initial expression of interest. Agencies requesting extensions must also submit an agreement accepting responsibility for providing and funding protection and maintenance for the requested property during the period of the extension until the property is transferred to the requesting agency or the requesting agency notifies GSA that it is no longer interested in the property. This assumption of protection and maintenance responsibility also applies to extensions associated with a requesting agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement (see § 102&#x2013;75.205).

####### § 102-75.1270 How does an agency request a transfer of Federal real property?

Agencies must use GSA Form 1334, Request for Transfer of Excess Real and Related Personal Property.

####### § 102-75.1275 Does a requesting agency have to pay for excess real property?

Yes. GSA is required by law to obtain full fair market value (as determined by the Administrator) for all real property (see § 102&#x2013;75.190), except when a transfer without reimbursement has been authorized (see § 102&#x2013;75.205). GSA, upon receipt of a valid expression of interest, will promptly provide each interested landholding agency with an estimate of fair market value for the property. GSA may transfer property without reimbursement, if directed to do so by law or special legislation and for the following purposes:

(a) Migratory Bird Management under Pub. L. 80&#x2013;537, as amended by Pub. L. 92&#x2013;432.

(b) Wildlife Conservation under Pub. L. 80&#x2013;537.

(c) Federal Correctional facilities.

(d) Joint Surveillance System.

####### § 102-75.1280 What happens if the property has already been declared surplus and an agency discovers a need for it?

GSA can redesignate surplus property as excess property, if the agency requests the property for use in direct support of its mission and GSA is satisfied that this transfer would be in the best interests of the Federal Government.

####### § 102-75.1285 How does GSA transfer excess real property to the requesting agency?

GSA transfers the property via letter assigning “custody and accountability” for the property to the requesting agency. Title to the property is held in the name of the United States; however, the requesting agency becomes the landholding agency and is responsible for providing and funding protection and maintenance for the property.

####### § 102-75.1290 What happens if the landholding agency requesting the property does not promptly accept custody and accountability?

(a) The requesting agency must assume protection and maintenance responsibilities for the property within 30 days of the date of the letter assigning custody and accountability for the property.

(b) After notifying the requesting agency, GSA may, at its discretion, pursue other disposal options.

(a) GSA adopts appendices C and D to 36 CFR part 1191 (ABA Chapters 1 and 2, and Chapters 3 through 10) as the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS). Facilities subject to the Architectural Barriers Act (other than facilities described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) must comply with ABAAS as set forth below:

(1) For construction or alteration of facilities subject to the Architectural Barriers Act (other than Federal lease-construction and other lease actions described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3), respectively, of this section), compliance with ABAAS is required if the construction or alteration commenced after May 8, 2006. If the construction or alteration of such a facility commenced on or before May 8, 2006, compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) is required.

(2) For Federal lease-construction actions subject to the Architectural Barriers Act, where the Government expressly requires new construction to meet its needs, compliance with ABAAS is required for all such leases awarded on or after June 30, 2006.

####### § 102-76.70 When are the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

For facilities subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a), the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations when they exceed 20 percent of the costs of the alterations to the primary function area. If a series of small alterations are made to areas containing a primary function and the costs of any of the alterations considered individually would not result in providing an accessible path of travel to the altered areas, the total costs of the alterations made within the three year period after the initial alteration must be considered when determining whether the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered areas are disproportionate. Facilities for which new leases are entered into must comply with F202.6 of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard without regard to whether the costs of alterations to comply with F202.6 are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations.

####### § 102-76.75 What costs are included in the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

For facilities subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a), the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function include the costs associated with&#x2014;

(a) Providing an accessible route to connect the altered area and site arrival points, including but not limited to interior and exterior ramps, elevators and lifts, and curb ramps;

(b) Making entrances serving the altered area accessible, including but not limited to widening doorways and installing accessible hardware;

(c) Making restrooms serving the altered area accessible, including, but not limited to, enlarging toilet stalls, installing grab bars and accessible faucet controls, and insulating pipes under lavatories;

(d) Making public telephones serving the altered area accessible, including, but not limited to, placing telephones at an accessible height, and installing amplification devices and TTYs;

(e) Making drinking fountains serving the altered area accessible; and

(f) Making parking spaces serving the altered area accessible.

####### § 102-76.80 What is required if the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations for facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

For facilities subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a), if the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations, the path of travel must be made accessible to the extent possible without exceeding 20 percent of the costs of the alterations to the primary function area. Priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the following order:

(a) An accessible route and an accessible entrance;

(b) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;

(c) Accessible telephones;

(d) Accessible drinking fountains; and

(e) Accessible parking spaces.

####### § 102-76.85 What is a primary function area for purposes of providing an accessible route in leased facilities subject to the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

For purposes of providing an accessible route in leased facilities subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a), a primary function area is an area that contains a major activity for which the leased facility is intended. Primary function areas include areas where services are provided to customers or the public, and offices and other work areas in which the activities of the Federal agency using the leased facility are carried out.

####### § 102-76.90 Who has the authority to waive or modify the standards in § 102-76.65(a)?

The Administrator of General Services has the authority to waive or modify the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a) on a case-by-case basis if the agency head or GSA department head submits a request for waiver or modification and the Administrator determines that the waiver or modification is clearly necessary.

####### § 102-76.95 What recordkeeping responsibilities do Federal agencies have?

(a) The head of each Federal agency must ensure that documentation is maintained on each contract, grant or loan for the design, construction or alteration of a facility and on each lease for a facility subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a) containing one of the following statements:

(1) The standards have been or will be incorporated in the design, the construction or the alteration.

(2) The grant or loan has been or will be made subject to a requirement that the standards will be incorporated in the design, the construction or the alteration.

(3) The leased facility meets the standards, or has been or will be altered to meet the standards.

(4) The standards have been waived or modified by the Administrator of General Services, and a copy of the waiver or modification is included with the statement.

(b) If a determination is made that a facility is not subject to the standards in § 102&#x2013;76.65(a) because the Architectural Barriers Act does not apply to the facility, the head of the Federal agency must ensure that documentation is maintained to justify the determination.

####### § 102-77.25 With whom should Federal agencies collaborate when commissioning visual art for Federal buildings?

To the maximum extent practicable, Federal agencies should seek the support and involvement of local citizens in commissioning a work of visual art. Federal agencies should collaborate with the chosen artist to commission works of visual art that reflect the cultural, intellectual, and historic interests and values of the community in which the art is to be located. In addition, Federal agencies should work collaboratively with the architect of the building and art professionals in commissioning visual art for Federal buildings. Federal agencies should commission a work of visual art that is diverse in style and media and no official style or media are mandated.

####### § 102-77.30 Do Federal agencies have responsibilities to provide national, regional, and local visibility for Art in Architecture?

Yes. Federal agencies should provide Art in Architecture that receives appropriate national, regional, and local visibility to encourage participation by a large, diverse, and equitable group of artists representing a wide variety of types of visual art.

##### PART 102-78 - HISTORIC PRESERVATION

###### Subpart A - General Provisions

####### § 102-78.5 What is the scope of this part?

##### PART 102-81 - PHYSICAL SECURITY

###### Subpart A - General Provisions

####### § 102-81.5 What does this part cover?

This part covers physical security in and at nonmilitary federally owned and leased facilities and grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services.means all or any part of any federally owned or leased building, physical structure or associated support infrastructure (parking facilities and utilities) that is under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA.mean all or any part of any area outside a Federal facility that is under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA.

####### § 102-81.10 What basic physical security policy governs Federal agencies?

The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) is responsible for developing and evaluating physical security standards for nonmilitary Federal facilities. In accordance with E.O. 12977, the ISC sets policies and recommendations that govern physical security at Federal facilities and on Federal grounds occupied by Federal employees for nonmilitary activities. This includes the ISC Risk Management Process Standard (the RMP Standard) that Federal agencies use in the protection of the real property they occupy, including the protection of persons on the property. The goal of the RMP Standard is a level of protection commensurate with the level of risk. ISC policies do not supersede other laws, regulations, and Executive orders that are intended to protect unique assets.

####### § 102-81.15 What are the governing authorities for this part?

The governing authorities are as follows:

(a) 40 U.S.C. 121(c) and 581.

####### § 102-81.20 Who must comply with this part?

Each agency occupying a Federal facility or Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA, including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services, for nonmilitary activities must comply with this part, except where the Director of National Intelligence determines that compliance would jeopardize intelligence sources and methods or the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance would conflict with the authorities of the Secretary of Energy over Restricted Data and Special Nuclear Material under, among others, sections 141, 145, 146, 147, and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Department of Energy Organization Act, or any other statute. In situations where a Federal facility is occupied by multiple Federal agencies for both military and nonmilitary activities, and each such occupancy is substantial, those occupants will coordinate on the physical security of the facility.

###### Subpart B - Physical Security

####### § 102-81.25 Who is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and upgrading physical security standards in each Federal facility and on Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA?

Each agency occupying a Federal facility or Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA, including those facilities and grounds that have been delegated by the Administrator of General Services, for nonmilitary activities is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and upgrading the physical security standards, except where the Director of National Intelligence determines that compliance would jeopardize intelligence sources and methods or the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance would conflict with the authorities of the Secretary of Energy over Restricted Data and Special Nuclear Material under, among others, sections 141, 145, 146, 147, and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Department of Energy Organization Act, or any other statute. An occupant agency, if it is the only Federal occupant agency in the building, or the Facility Security Committee (FSC), as applicable, uses the facility security assessment reports they receive from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x2014;Federal Protective Service to inform deliberations regarding recommended countermeasures and other security-related actions. GSA will facilitate the implementation of the countermeasures or other actions after occupant agency or FSC approval, as applicable, and commitment of each occupant agency to pay itsshare of the cost.

####### § 102-81.30 Are there any special considerations for existing Federal facilities and Federal grounds under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA?

No, the RMP Standard applies to existing nonmilitary Federal facilities as part of the periodic risk assessment process. The security organization responsible for the Federal facility or Federal grounds will conduct a periodic risk assessment and recommend countermeasures and design features to be implemented at the Federal facility or on the Federal grounds. The FSC will determine whether the recommended countermeasures will be implemented or if risk will be accepted. The design and implementation of approved countermeasures at existing facilities must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders. For approved countermeasures that cannot be implemented immediately, a plan to phase in countermeasures and achieve compliance must be instituted and documented in accordance with the RMP Standard. In some cases, the implementation of countermeasures must be delayed until renovations or modernization programs occur.

####### § 102-81.31 Are there any special considerations for leased facilities or new construction?

Yes. GSA will coordinate with the occupant agency and the security organization responsible for the Federal facility or Federal grounds when determining the applicable physical security clauses to use in the procurement package.

(19) Executive Order 13006 of May 21, 1996 (61 FR 26071).

####### § 102-85.10 What is the scope of this part?

(a) This part describes GSA policy and principles for the assignment and occupancy of space under its control and the rights and obligations of GSA and the customer agencies that request or occupy such space pursuant to GSA Occupancy Agreements (OA).

(b) Space managed by agencies under delegation of authority from GSA is subject to the provisions of this part.

(c) This part is not applicable to:

(1) Licenses, permits or leases with non-Federal entities under the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act (40 U.S.C. 490(a)(16&#x2013;19)); or

(2) The disposal of surplus lease space under section 210(h)(2) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(h)(2)).

####### § 102-85.15 What are the basic policies for charging Rent for space and services?

(a) GSA will charge for space and services furnished by GSA (unless otherwise exempted by the Administrator of General Services) a Rent charge which will approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. Rent for all assignments for GSA-controlled space will be priced according to the principles of the pricing policy in this part. These principles are reflected in the following elements of GSA Rent charges:

(1) “Shell” Rent based on approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services for Federally owned space (accomplished using appraisal procedures);

(2) Rent based on actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee;

(3) Amortization of any tenant improvement allowance used;

(4) Any applicable real estate taxes, operating costs, parking, security and joint use fees; and

(5) For certain projects involving new construction or major renovation of Federally-owned buildings, a return on investment pricing approach if an appraisal-determined rental value does not provide a minimum return (OMB discount rate for calculating the present value of yearly costs plus 2%) on the cost of the prospective capital investment. Each specific use of Return on Investment (ROI) pricing must be approved by OMB and duly recorded in an Occupancy Agreement (OA) with the customer agency. Once the ROI methodology is employed to establish Rent for a capital investment, the ROI method must be retained for the duration of the OA term.

(b) Special services not included in the standard levels of service may be provided by GSA on a reimbursable basis. GSA may also furnish alterations on a reimbursable basis in buildings where GSA is responsible for alterations only.

(c) The financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a customer agency occupies, each block of GSA-controlled space, shall be documented in a written OA.

####### § 102-85.20 What does an Occupancy Agreement (OA) do?

An OA defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency and:

(a) Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights, and obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment;

(b) Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and customer agencies;

(c) Stabilizes Rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired by customers; and

(d) Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer agency needs.

####### § 102-85.25 What is the basic principle governing OAs?

The basic principle governing OAs is to adopt the private sector practice of capturing in a written document the business terms to which GSA and a customer agency agree concerning individual space assignments.

####### § 102-85.30 Are there special rules for certain Federal customers?

Yes, in lieu of OAs, GSA is able to enter into agreements with customer agencies that reflect the parties particular needs. For example, the space and services provided to the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are governed by existing memoranda of agreement (MOA). When there are conflicts between the provisions of this part and MOAs, the MOAs prevail.

####### § 102-85.35 What definitions apply to this part?

The following definitions apply to this part:

ormeans a commitment from an agency to occupy specified GSA-controlled space.

means:

(1) Space that is owned, leased, or otherwise controlled or operated by Federal agencies under any authority other than the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; and

(2) it also includes agency-acquired space for which acquisition authority has been delegated or otherwise granted to the agency by GSA. It does not include space covered by an OA.

oris defined in the definition for space assignment.

means the complete enveloping structure, the base-building systems, and the finished common areas (building common and floor common) of a building that bound the tenant areas.

means any department, agency, or independent establishment in the Federal Government, including any wholly-owned corporation; any executive agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol, and any activities under his direction).

is a customer move that results from an extraordinary event such as a fire, natural disaster, or immediate threat to the health and safety of occupants that renders a current space assignment unusable and requires that it be vacated, permanently or temporarily.

means the fund into which Rent charges and other revenues are deposited, and collections cited in section 210(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (U.S.C. 490(j)), and from which monies are available for expenditures for real property management and related activities in such amounts as are specified in annual appropriations acts without regard to fiscal year limitations.

means workspace for which the United States Government has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, requisition, or condemnation. Such workspace excludes space owned or leased by private sector entities performing work on Government contracts.

means space, the title to which is vested in the United States Government or which will vest automatically according to an existing agreement.

means the involuntary physical relocation, from one space assignment to another, of a customer agency housed in GSA-controlled space initiated by another customer agency or by GSA, before the expiration of a lease or an OA term. (See also the definition of GSA-initiated move.)

means all types of space other than “warehouse,” “parking,” or “unique” space, as defined elsewhere in this part. Examples of general use space are:

(1) Office and office-related space such as file areas, libraries, meeting rooms, computer rooms, mail rooms, training and conference, automated data processing operations, courtrooms, and judicial chambers; and

(2) Storage space that contains different quality and finishes from general use space, but that is within a building where predominantly general use space is located.

means Federally controlled space under the custody or control of GSA. It includes space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance, or protection authority to the customer agency.

means GSA-controlled space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance or protection authority to the customer agency.

means any relocation action in GSA-controlled space that:

(1) Is involuntary to the customer agency and required to be effective prior to the expiration of an effective OA, or in the case of leased space, prior to the expiration of the lease; or

(2) Is an emergency relocation initiated by GSA.

See definition of “tenant improvement.”

means the specific placement of workstations, furniture and equipment within new space assignments.

means a summary or itemized list of the real property, and associated descriptive information, that is under the control of a Federal agency.

means common space within a Federally controlled facility, not specifically assigned to any one agency, and available for use by multiple agencies, such as cafeterias, auditoriums, conference rooms, credit unions, visitor parking spaces, snack bars, certain wellness/physical fitness facilities, and child care centers.

means space for which the United States Government has a right of use and occupancy by virtue of having acquired a leasehold interest.

means space that, due to its layout, design, location, or other characteristics, is unlikely to be needed by another GSA customer agency. Typical conditions that might cause space to be defined as non-cancelable are:

(1) Special space construction features;

(2) Lack of any realistic Federal need for the space other than by the requesting agency; and

(3) Remote location or unusual term (short or long) desired by the agency.

means a written agreement descriptive of the financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a customer agency occupies, the GSA-controlled space identified therein.

ormeans surface land, structures, or areas within structures designed and designated for the purpose of parking vehicles.

means the peak number of persons to be housed during a single shift, regardless of how many workstations are provided for them. In addition to permanent employees of the agency, personnel includes temporaries, part-time, seasonal, and contractual employees, budgeted vacancies, and employees of other agencies and organizations who are housed in a space assignment.

mean long term or “master” leases, usually negotiated to house several agencies whose individual term requirements differ from the terms of the underlying GSA lease with the lessor, and from each other. These may also be leases housing single agencies, but which entail for GSA responsibilities (burdens and benefits) which mimic an ownership position, or equity rights, even though no equity interest or ownership liability exists. An example of the latter would be long term renewal options on a lease which, in order to enjoy, involve substantial capital outlays by GSA to improve the building infrastructure. In both these cases, GSA is assuming risks or capital expenditures outside of the conventions of single transactions or occupancies. Accordingly, for a portfolio lease, it is not appropriate merely to pass through to the customer agency(ies) the rental rate of the underlying GSA lease. Portfolio leases are treated for pricing purposes as owned space, with Rent set by appraisal.

means the use to which the greatest portion of a location is put. Predominant use is determined by the Public Buildings Service (PBS), GSA, and will typically result in the designation of a location as one of four types of space&#x2014;General Use, Warehouse, Unique, or Parking&#x2014;even though some smaller portions of the space may be used for one or more of the other types of uses.

means the amounts charged by GSA for space and related services to the customer agencies with tenancy in GSA-controlled space. The word “Rent” is capitalized to differentiate it from the contract “rent” that GSA pays lessors.

means the amount of space as defined in “Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)/American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z65.1&#x2013;1996.” The BOMA/ANSI standard also defines “gross,” “office area,” “floor common,” and “building common” areas. Any references to these terms in this part refer to the BOMA/ANSI standard definitions. This standard has been adopted in accordance with GSA's interest in conforming its practices to nationally recognized industry standards to the extent possible.

ormeans a written or electronically submitted document or an oral request, within which an agency's space needs are summarized. A request for space is requisite for development of an OA. Thus, it must be submitted to GSA by a duly authorized official of the customer agency, and it must be accompanied by documentation of the customer agency's ability to fund payment of required Rent charges.

is one possible methodology used to establish a Rent rate for certain owned space. Typically, ROI pricing is a Rent rate that ensures GSA a reasonable return on its cost to acquire and improve the asset. ROI pricing may be used where no other comparable commercial space is available or no other appraisal method would be appropriate. It may also be used in cases in which an appraisal-based rental rate will not meet GSA's minimum return requirements for the planned level of investment.

mean Rent charges for building services provided by GSA's Federal Protective Service. Security fees are comprised of basic and building specific charges.

(a) A basic security fee is assessed in all PBS-controlled properties where the Federal Protective Service (FPS) provides security services. The rate is set annually on a per-square-foot basis. The charge includes the following services:

(1) General law enforcement on PBS-controlled property;

(2) Physical security assessments;

(3) Crime prevention and awareness training;

(4) Advice and assistance to building security committees;

(5) Intelligence sharing program;

(6) Criminal investigation;

(7) Assistance and coordination in Occupancy Emergency Plan development;

(8) Coordination of mobilization and response to terrorist threat or civil disturbance;

(9) Program administration for security guard contracts; and

(10) Megacenter operations for monitoring building perimeter alarms and dispatching appropriate law enforcement response.

(b) The building specific security charge is comprised of two elements: Operating expenses and amortized capital costs. Building specific charges, whether operating expenses or capital costs, are distributed overall federal users by building or facility in direct proportion to each customer agency's percentage of federal occupancy. As with joint use charges, the distribution of building-specific charges among customer agencies is not re-adjusted for vacancy.

means a defined area within a building and/or parcel of land. (Personal property and furniture are not included.)

means a standard agreed upon by GSA and a customer agency, written in terms that permit nationwide or regional application, that is used as a basis for establishing that agency's space requirements. An SAS may describe special GSA and customer agency funding responsibilities, although such responsibilities will be covered in OAs for space assignments. An SAS may also be developed between GSA and customer agencies on a regional level to standardize or simplify transactions, provided that the terms of a regional SAS are consistent with the terms of that agency's national SAS and the terms of this part.

ormeans a transaction between GSA and a customer agency that results in a customer agency's right to occupy certain GSA-controlled space, usually in return for customer agency payment(s) to GSA for use of the space. Space assignment rights, obligations, and responsibilities not covered in this part, or in the customer guides, are formalized in an OA.

means the process of using recognized professional techniques of planning, layout and interior design to determine the best internal location and the most efficient configuration for satisfying agency space needs.

means a summary statement of an agency's space needs. These requirements will generally include information about location, square footage, construction requirements, and duration of the agency's space need. They may be identified in any format mutually agreeable to GSA and the agency.

means space which has unusual architectural/construction features, requires the installation of special equipment, or requires disproportionately high or low costs to construct, maintain and/or operate as compared to office or storage space. Special space generally refers to space which has construction features, finishes, services, utilities, or other additional costs beyond those specified in the customer general allowance (e.g., courtrooms, laboratories).

See § 102&#x2013;85.165 for the definition of standard level of service.

means electronic processing of information, either voice or data or both, over a wide variety of media, (e.g., copper wire, microwave, fiber optics, radio frequencies), between individuals or offices within a building (e.g., local area networks), between buildings, and between cities.

means a finished component of an interior block of space. Tenant improvements represent additions to or alterations of the building shell that adapt the workspace to the specific uses of the customer. If made at initial occupancy, the TIs are known as initial space alterations or ISAs.

means the dollar amount, including design, labor, materials, contractor costs (if contractors are used), management, and inspection, that GSA will spend to construct, alter, and finish space for customer occupancy (excluding personal property and furniture, which are customer agency responsibilities) at initial occupancy. The dollar amounts for the allowances are different for each agency and bureau to accommodate agencies' different mission needs. The dollar amounts also may vary by locations reflecting different costs in different markets. The PBS bill will only reflect the actual amount the customers spend, not the allowance. The amount of the TI allowance is determined by GSA. Agencies can request that GSA revise the TI allowance amount by project or categorically for an entire bureau. The cost of replacement of tenant improvements is borne by the customer agency.

means space for which there is no commercial market comparable (e.g., border stations).

ormeans space contained in a structure primarily intended for the housing of files, records, equipment, or other personal property, and is not primarily intended for housing personnel and office operations. Warehouse space generally is designed and constructed to lower specifications than office buildings, with features such as exposed ceilings, unfinished perimeter and few dividing partitions. Warehouse space also is usually heated to a lesser degree but not air-conditioned, and is cleaned to lesser standards than office space.

means Federally controlled space in buildings and structures (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary) that provides an acceptable environment for the performance of agency mission requirements by employees or by other persons occupying it.

####### § 102-85.40 What are the major components of the pricing policy?

The major components of the pricing policy are:

(a) An OA between a customer agency and GSA;

(b) Tenant improvement allowance; and

(c) The establishment of Rent the agency pays to GSA based on the OA for:

(1) Leased space, a pass-through to the customer agency of the underlying GSA lease contract costs, and a PBS fee; or

(2) GSA-owned space, Rent determined by appraisal.

###### Subpart B - Occupancy Agreement

####### § 102-85.45 When is an Occupancy Agreement required?

An Occupancy Agreement (OA) is required for each customer agency's space assignment. The OA must be agreed to by GSA and the customer agency prior to GSA's commitment of funds for occupancy and formal assignment of space.

####### § 102-85.50 When does availability of funding have to be certified?

The customer agency must sign an OA prior to GSA's making any major contractual commitments associated with the space request. Typically, this should occur at the earliest possible opportunity-i.e., when funds become available. However, in no event shall certification occur later than just prior to the award of the contract to a design architect in the case of Federal construction or renovation in Federally owned space or prior to the award of a lease. This serves as a customer agency's funding commitment unless certification is provided on another document.

####### § 102-85.55 What are the terms and conditions included in an OA?

The terms and conditions are modeled after commercial practice. They are intended to reflect a full mutual understanding of the financial terms and agreement of the parties. The OA describes the actual space and services to be provided and all associated actual costs to the customer during the term of occupancy. The OA does not include any general provisions or terms contained in this part. OAs typically describe the following, depending on whether the space is leased or Federally owned:

(a) Assigned square footage;

(b) Shell Rent and term of occupancy;

(c) Amortized amount of customer allowance used;

(d) Operating costs and escalations;

(e) One time charges; e.g., lump sum payments by the customer;

(f) Real estate tax and escalations;

(g) Parking and escalations;

(h) Additional/reduced services;

(i) Security services and associated Rent;

(j) Joint use space and associated Rent;

(k) PBS fee;

(l) Customer rights and provisions for occupancy after OA expiration;

(m) Cancellation provisions if different from this part or the customer service guides;

(n) Any special circumstances associated with the occupancy, such as environmental responsibilities, unusual use restrictions, or agreements with local authorities;

(o) Emergency relocations;

(p) Clauses specific to the agreement;

(q) Other Rent, e.g., charges for antenna sites, land;

(r) Agency standard clauses; and

(s) General clauses defining the obligations of both parties.

####### § 102-85.60 Who can execute an OA?

Authorized GSA and customer agency officials who can commit or obligate the funds of their respective agencies can execute an OA. Higher level signatories may be appropriate from both agencies for space assignments in owned or leased space, that are unusual in size, location, duration, public interest, or other factors. Each agency decides its appropriate signatory level.

####### § 102-85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?

An OA obligates the executing customer agency to fund the current-year Rent obligation owed GSA, as well as to reimburse GSA for any otherobligations that GSA may have incurred on behalf of the customer agency. Although the OA is an interagency agreement, memorializing the understanding of GSA and its customer agency, the OA may not be construed as obligating future year customer agency funds until they are legally available. A multi-year OA commitment assumes the customer agency will seek the necessary funding through budget and appropriations processes.

####### § 102-85.70 Are the standard OA terms appropriate for non-cancelable space?

Yes, most of the standard terms apply; however, the right to cancel upon a 4-month (120 day) notice is not available. See § 102&#x2013;85.35 for the definition of non-cancelable space.

####### § 102-85.75 When can space assignments be terminated?

(a) Customer agencies can terminate any space assignments, except those designated as non-cancelable, with the following stipulations:

(1) The agency must give GSA written notice at least four months prior to termination.

(2) The agency is responsible for reimbursing GSA for the unpaid balance of the cost of tenant improvements, generally prior to GSA releasing the agency from the space assignment. In the event the customer agency received a rent concession (e.g., free rent) at the inception of the assignment as part of the consideration for the entire lease term, then the amount of the concession applicable to the remaining term must be repaid to GSA.

(3) If the space to be vacated is ready for occupancy by another customer and marketable, GSA accepts the termination of assignment.

(4) If the agency has vacated all of the space and removed all personal property and equipment from the space by the cancellation date in the written notice, the agency will be released effective that date from further Rent payments.

(5) An agency may terminate a GSA space assignment with less than a four-month advance written notice to GSA, if:

(i) Either GSA or the terminating agency has identified another agency customer for the assigned space and that substitute agency wants and is able to fully assume the Rent payments due from the terminating agency; and

(ii) The terminating agency continues to pay Rent until the new agency starts paying Rent.

(b) GSA can terminate space assignments according to GSA regulations for emergency or forced moves.

(c) OAs terminate automatically at expiration.

####### § 102-85.80 Who is financially responsible for expenses resulting from tenant non-performance?

The customer agencies are financially responsible for expenses incurred by the Government as a result of any failure on their part to fulfill a commitment outlined in an OA or other written agreements in advance of, or in addition to, the OA. Customer agencies are also financially responsible for revised design costs and any additional costs resulting from changes to space requirements or space layouts made by the agency after a lease, alteration, design, or construction contract has been awarded by GSA.

####### § 102-85.85 What if a customer agency participates in a consolidation?

If an agency agrees to participate in a consolidation upon expiration of an OA, the relocation expenses will be addressed in the new OA negotiated by GSA and the customer agency. The customer agency generally pays such costs.

###### Subpart C - Tenant Improvement Allowance

####### § 102-85.90 What is a tenant improvement allowance?

A tenant improvement (TI) allowance enables the customer agency to design, configure and build out space to support its program operations. It is based on local market construction costs and the specific bureau's historical use of space. (See also the definition at § 102&#x2013;85.35.)

####### § 102-85.95 Who pays for the TI allowance?

The customer agency pays for the amount of the tenant improvement allowance actually used.

####### § 102-85.100 How does a customer agency pay for tenant improvements?

To pay for the installation of tenant improvements, the customer agency may spend an amount not to exceed the tenant allowance. The amount spent by the customer agency for TIs is amortized over a period of time specified in the OA, not to exceed the useful life of the improvements. This amortization payment is in addition to the shell rent and services.

####### § 102-85.105 How does an agency pay for customer alterations that exceed the TI allowance?

Amounts exceeding the TI allowance are paid in a one-time lump sum and are not amortized over the term of the occupancy. The agency certifies lump sum funds are available prior to GSA proceeding with the work.

####### § 102-85.110 Can the allowance amount be changed?

The GSA schedule of allowances for new assignments is adjusted annually for design and construction cost changes. As the need arises, GSA may adjust an agency or bureau's TI allowance. GSA may also adjust a TI allowance for a specific project, if conditions warrant. This decision is solely GSA's. In addition, the customer agency may waive any part or all of its customization allowance in the case of a new space assignment. In the case of backfill space (also known as relet space), the customer agency can also waive any part or all of the tenant general allowance, if the customer agency will use the existing tenant improvements, with or without modifications.

###### Subpart D - Rent Charges

####### § 102-85.115 How is the Rent determined?

Unless an exemption is granted under the authority of the Administrator of General Services, the Rent charged approximates commercial charges for comparable space and space-related services as follows:

(a) Generally, Rent for Federally owned space provided by GSA is based on market appraisals of fully serviced rental values for the predominant use to which space in a building is put; e.g., general use, warehouse use, and parking use. In cases where market appraisals are not practical; e.g., in cases involving unique space or when market comparables are not available, GSA may establish Rent on the basis of alternate commercial practices. See the discussion of alternate valuation methods in § 102&#x2013;85.125. Amortization of tenant improvements, parking fees, and security charges are calculated separately and added to the appraised shell Rent to establish the Rent charge. Customer agencies also pay for a pro rata share of joint use space.

(b) Generally, Rent for space leased by GSA is based on the actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee, and security charges and parking (if not in the lease).

(1) The Rent is based on the terms and conditions of the OA, starting with the shell Rent.

(2) In addition to the shell Rent, the Rent includes amortization of TI allowances used, real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services, parking, GSA fee for its services, and charges for security, joint-use, and other applicable rental charges (e.g., antenna site, land, wareyard).

####### § 102-85.120 What is shell Rent?

Shell Rent is that portion of GSA Rent charged for the building envelope and land. (See § 102&#x2013;85.35 for the definition of building shell.)

####### § 102-85.125 What alternate methods may be used to establish Rent in Federally-owned space?

Alternate methods of establishing Rent are based on private sector models. They include, but are not limited to:

(a) Return on investment (ROI) approach or a similar cost recovery method used when market comparables are not available and/or GSA must “build to suit” to fulfill customer agency requirements; e.g., border stations; and

(b) Rent schedules for the right to use rooftops and other floor areas not suitable for workspace; e.g., antenna sites and signage.

####### § 102-85.130 How are exemptions from Rent granted?

Exemptions from Rent are rare. However, the Administrator of General Services may exempt any GSA customer from Rent after a determination that application of Rent would not be feasible or practical. Customer agency requests for exemptions must be addressed to the Administrator of General Services and submitted in accordance with GSA Order PBS 4210.1, “Rent Exemption Procedures,” dated December 20, 1991, or in accordance with any superseding GSA order. A copy of the order may be obtained from the Office of Portfolio Management, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

####### § 102-85.135 What if space and services are provided by other executive agencies?

Any executive agency other than GSA providing space and services is authorized to charge the occupant for the space and services at rates approved by the Administrator of General Services and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. If space and services are of the type provided by the Administrator of General Services, the executive agency providing the space and services must credit the monies derived from any fees or charges to the appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the space or services, as prescribed by Subsection 210(k) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(k)).

####### § 102-85.140 How are changes in Rent reflected in OAs?

(a) If Rent changes in ways that are identified in the OA, then no change to the OA is required. Typically, OAs state that certain components of Rent are subject to annual escalation; e.g., operating expenses, real estate taxes, parking charges, the basic security charge, and building-specific security operating and amortized capital expenses which do not entail a change in service level. Also, in Federally-owned space, OAs state that the shell rent is re-marked to market every five years. In leased space, the OA will identify any programmed changes in the lease contract rent (such as pre-set increases or steps in the contract rent rate) that will translate into a change in the customer agency's Rent. Changes in Rent specified in OAs will serve as notice to agencies of future Rent changes for budgeting purposes. For a discussion of budgeting for Rent, see § 102&#x2013;85.160.

(b) Changes to Rent other than those identified in paragraph (a) of this section typically require an amended OA. There are many events that might occasion a change in Rent, and an amended OA, such as:

(1) An agency expands or contracts at an existing location;

(2) PBS agrees to fund additional tenant improvements that are then amortized over the remaining OA term, or over an extended OA term;

(3) Upon physical re-measurement, the true square footage of the space assignment is found to be different from the square footage of record;

(4) The amount of joint use space in the building changes;

(5) The level of building-specific security services changes; or

(6) PBS undertakes new capital expenditures for new or enhanced security countermeasures.

####### § 102-85.145 When are customer agencies responsible for Rent charges?

(a) When a customer agency occupies cancelable space, it is responsible for Rent charges until:

(1) The date of release specified in the OA, or until the date space is actually vacated, whichever occurs later; or

(2) Four months after having provided GSA written notice of release; or

(3) The date space is actually vacated, whenever occupancy extends beyond the date agreed upon under either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(b) When a customer agency releases non-cancelable space, it is responsible for all attributable Rent and other space charges until the OA expires. This responsibility is mitigated to the extent that GSA is able to assign the space to another user or dispose of it. (See § 102&#x2013;85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?)

(c) When a customer agency commits to occupy space in an OA or other binding document, but never occupies that space, that agency is responsible for:

(1) Non-cancelable space: Rent payments due for the space until the OA expires, unless GSA can mitigate; or

(2) All other space: Either GSA's space charges for 4 months plus the cost of tenant improvements or GSA's actual costs, whichever is less.

####### § 102-85.150 How will Rent charges be reflected on the customer agency's Rent bill?

Rent charges are billed monthly, in arrears, based on an annual rate which is divided by 12. Billing commences the first month in which the agency occupies the space for more than half of the month, and ends in the last month the agency occupies the space.

####### § 102-85.155 What does a customer agency do if it does not agree with a Rent bill?

(a) If a customer agency does not agree with the way GSA has determined its Rent obligation (e.g., the agency does not agree with GSA's space classification, appraised Rent, or the allocation of space), the agency may appeal its Rent bill to GSA.

(b) GSA will not increase or otherwise change Rent for any assignment, except as agreed in an OA, in the case of errors, or when the OA is amended. However, customer agencies may at any time request a regional review of the measurement, classification, service levels provided, or charges assessed that pertain to the space assignment without resorting to formal procedures. Such requests do not constitute appeals and should be directed to the appropriate GSA Regional Administrator.

(c) If a customer agency still wants to pursue a formal appeal of Rent charges, they may do so, but with the following limitations:

(1) Terms, including rates, to which the parties agree in an OA are not appealable;

(2) In leased space, the contract rent passed through from the underlying lease cannot be appealed;

(3) In GSA-owned space, when the fully-serviced shell Rent is established through appraisal, the appraised rate must exceed comparable commercial square foot rates by 20 percent. When shell Rent in owned space is established on the basis of ROI at the inception of an OA, and the customer agency executes the OA, then the ROI rate cannot later be appealed. Other components of Rent that are established on the basis of actual cost&#x2014;eg., amortization of TIs and building specific security charges&#x2014;also cannot be appealed.

(4) Additionally, the customer agency is required to compare its assigned space with other space in the surrounding community that:

(i) Is available in similar size block of space in a comparable location;

(ii) Is comparable in quality to the space provided by GSA;

(iii) Provides similar service levels as part of the charges;

(iv) Contains similar contractual terms, conditions, and escalations clauses; and

(v) Represents a lease transaction completed at a similar point in time.

(5) Data from at least three comparable locations will be necessary to demonstrate a market trend sufficient to warrant revising an appraised Rent charge.

(d) A customer agency filing an appeal for a particular location or building must develop documentation supporting the appeal and file the appeal with the appropriate Regional Administrator. The GSA regional office will verify all pertinent information and documentation supporting the appeal. The GSA Regional Administrator will accept or deny the appeal and will notify the appealing agency of his or her ruling.

(e) A further appeal may be filed by the customer agency's headquarters level officials with the Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, if equitable resolution has not been obtained from the initial appeal. A head of a customer agency may further appeal to the Administrator of the General Services. Documentation of the procedures followed for prior resolution must accompany an appeal to the Administrator. Decisions made by the Administrator are final.

(f) Adjustments of Rent resulting from reviews and appeals will be effective in the month that the agency submitted a properly documented appeal. Adjustments in Rent made under this section remain in effect for the remainder of the 5-year period in which the charges cited in the OA were applicable.

####### § 102-85.160 How does a customer agency know how much to budget for Rent?

GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate, shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to:

(a) New assignments;

(b) Changes in current assignments;

(c) Leased space;

(d) New tenant improvement amortization;

(e) Building specific security costs; and

(f) New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due to changes in scope of proposed projects or repair and/or replacement of building components

###### Subpart E - Standard Levels of Service

####### § 102-85.165 What are standard levels of service?

(a) The standard levels of service covered by GSA Rent are comparable to those furnished in commercial practice. They are based on the effort required to service the customer agency's space for a 5-day week (Monday to Friday), one-shift regular work schedule. GSA will provide adequate building startup services, before the beginning of the customer's regular one-shift work schedule, and shutdown services after the end of this schedule.

(b) Without additional charge, GSA customers may use their assigned space and supporting automatic elevator systems, lights and small office and business machines including personal computers on an incidental basis, unless specified otherwise in the OA.

####### § 102-85.170 Can flexitime and other alternative work schedules cost the customer agency more?

Yes, GSA customers who extend their regular work schedule by a system of flexible hours shall reimburse GSA for its approximate cost of the additional services required.

####### § 102-85.175 Are the standard level services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance identified in an OA?

Unless specified otherwise in the OA, standard level services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance shall be provided in accordance with the GSA standard level of services as defined in § 102&#x2013;85.165, and in the PBS Customer Guide to Real Property. A copy of the guide may be obtained from the General Services Administration, Office of Business Performance (PX), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

####### § 102-85.180 Can there be other standard services?

GSA may provide additional services to its customers at the levels and times deemed by the Administrator of General Services to be necessary for efficient operations and proper servicing of space under the assignment responsibility of GSA.

####### § 102-85.185 Can space be exempted from the standard levels of service

Yes, customer agencies may be excused from paying for standard service levels for space assignments when:

(a) In GSA-delegated space, the customer agency provides for these services itself and thus pays Rent minus charges for these services; or

(b) In rare instances, standard service levels may be waived by the Administrator of General Services in instances where charging for such standard services would not be feasible or practical, e.g., in assignments of limited square footage or functional use.

####### § 102-85.190 Can GSA Rent be adjusted when standard levels of service are performed by other customer agencies?

Customer agencies that arrange and pay separately for the costs of standard level services normally covered by GSA Rent will receive a Rent credit or other type of reimbursement by GSA for the amount GSA would have charged for such services. The type of reimbursement is at GSA's discretion. The reimbursement is limited to the amount included for the services in GSA Rent. Approval to perform or contract for such services must be obtained in advance by the customer agency from the appropriate GSA regional office.

###### Subpart F - Special Services

####### § 102-85.195 Does GSA provide special services?

Yes, GSA provides special services on a cost-reimbursable basis:

(a) In GSA-controlled space, GSA may provide for special services that cannot be separated from the building or space costs (inseparable services, such as utilities, which are not individually metered). GSA's estimate of the special service cost is the basis for the bill amount. The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee for GSA's services.

(b) GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.

###### Subpart G - Continued Occupancy, Relocation and Forced Moves

####### § 102-85.200 Can customer agencies continue occupancy of space or must they relocate at the end of an OA?

The answer is contingent upon whether the customer agency is in Federally owned or leased space.

(a) Unless stated otherwise in the OA, a customer agency within a GSA controlled, Federally owned building has automatic occupancy rights at the end of the OA term for occupied space. However, a new OA must be negotiated.

(b) In leased space, the OA generally reflects the provisions of the underlying lease and will specify whether or not renewal options are available. If the OA does not include a renewal option, customer agencies should assume relocation would be necessary upon OA expiration, and budget for it. Further, renewal options are not, in themselves, a guarantee of continued occupancy at that location. In some cases, the renewal rate is substantially above market or the option was not part of the initial price evaluation for the occupancy. In such cases, GSA may be required to run a competition for the replacement lease, and a relocation may ensue. Nonetheless, it is also possible that GSA may execute a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor, in which case there is no move.

(c) GSA and customer agencies should initiate discussions at least 18&#x2013;20 months in advance of OA expiration to address an action for the replacement or continued occupancy of the existing space assignment. This allows both agencies time to budget for the work and the cost.

####### § 102-85.205 What happens if a customer agency continues occupancy after the expiration of an OA?

A mutual goal of GSA and its customers is to have current OAs in place for all space assignments. However, provisions are necessary to cover the GSA and customer relationship if an OA expires prior to execution of a mutually desired succeeding agreement. Because the risks, liabilities, and consequences of a customer's continued occupancy depend on whether the assigned space is leased or Federally owned, different provisions in the following table apply:

####### § 102-85.210 What if a customer agency has to relocate?

If the agency or GSA determines relocation is necessary at the expiration of an OA for either Federally owned or leased space, the customer agency is responsible for all costs associated with relocation at that time.

####### § 102-85.215 What if another customer agency forces a GSA customer to move?

If a GSA customer agency, or GSA, forces the relocation of another GSA customer agency prior to the expiration of the customer's OA, the “forcing” agency is responsible:

(a) For all reasonable costs associated with the relocation of the agency being “forced” to move, including architectural-engineering design, move coordination and physical relocation, telecommunications and ADP equipment relocation and installation;

(b) To GSA for all of the relocated agency's unpaid tenant improvements, if any; and

(c) To the customer agency for the undepreciated amount of any lump sum payment that was already made by the agency for alterations.

####### § 102-85.220 Can a customer agency forced to relocate waive the reimbursements?

Yes, a customer agency forced to relocate can waive some or all of the reimbursements from the forcing agency that are prescribed in § 102&#x2013;85.215. However, a relocated customer agency cannot waive the requirement for the forcing customer agency to reimburse GSA for unpaid tenant improvements. If GSA is the “forcing” agency, it is responsible for the same costs as any other forcing customer agency.

####### § 102-85.225 What are the funding responsibilities for relocations resulting from emergencies?

(a) In emergencies, swift remedies, including the possible relocation of a customer agency to alternate space, are required. The remedies may include requests for funding authorizations from OMB and Congress. GSA may serve as the central coordinator of such remedies.

(b) Funding responsibility will vary by situation. If a customer agency is only temporarily displaced from its space, GSA typically covers the cost of temporary set-up in a provisional location. If the agency is obliged to relocate permanently, an OA will be prepared which will address all terms of the occupancy. In such cases, new tenant improvements will be constructed which can be amortized over the life of a new occupancy term, and a new Rent rate will be developed.

#### Subchapter D - Transportation

##### PART 102-116 - GENERAL [RESERVED]

##### PART 102-117 - TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 102-117.5 What is transportation management?

Transportation management is agency oversight of the physical movement of commodities, household goods (HHG) and other freight from one location to another by a transportation service provider (TSP).

####### § 102-117.10 What is the scope of this part?

This part addresses shipping freight and household goods worldwide. Freight is property or goods transported as cargo. Household goods are not Government property, but are employees' personal property entrusted to the Government for shipment.

####### § 102-117.15 To whom does this part apply?

This part applies to all agencies and wholly-owned Government corporations as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101,and 31 U.S.C. 9101(3), except as otherwise expressly provided.

####### § 102-117.20 Are any agencies exempt from this part?

(a) The Department of Defense is exempted from this part by an agreement under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 501), except for the rules to debar or suspend a TSP under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4).

(b) Subpart D of this part, covering household goods, does not apply to the uniformed service members, under Title 37 of the United States Code, “Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services,” including the uniformed service members serving in civilian agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Public Health Service.

####### § 102-117.25 What definitions apply to this part?

The following definitions apply to this part:

means charges that are applied to the base tariff rate or base contract of carriage rate. Examples of accessorial charges are:

(1) Bunkers, destination/delivery, container surcharges, and currency exchange for international shipments.

(2) Inside delivery, redelivery, re-consignment, and demurrage or detention for freight.

(3) Packing, unpacking, appliance servicing, blocking and bracing, and special handling for household goods.

means a department, agency, and independent establishment in the executive branch of the Government as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101and a wholly-owned Government corporation as defined in 31 U.S.C. 9101(3).

sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of lading, but includes a Government bill of lading (GBL), means the document used as a receipt of goods, a contract of carriage, and documentary evidence of title.

is the legal requirement for all, or a portion of all, ocean-borne cargo to be transported on U.S. flag vessels.

is the system under which an agency may allow its employees to make their own household goods shipping arrangements, and apply for reimbursement.

is the person or agent to whom freight or household goods are delivered.

also referred to as the shipper, is the person or firm that ships freight or household goods to a consignee.

is a contract between the TSP and the agency to transport freight or household goods.

is an action to exclude a TSP, for a period of time, from providing services under a rate tender or any contract under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.406).

means the actual value of cargo as declared by the agency for reimbursement purposes or to establish duties, taxes, or other customs fees. Theis the maximum amount that could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage for the shipments of freight and household goods, unless the declared value exceeds the carrier's released value (see “Released value”). The statement of declared value must be shown on any applicable tariff, tender, contract, bill of lading, or other document covering the shipment.

is the penalty charge to an agency for delaying the agreed time to load or unload shipments by rail or ocean TSPs.

is the penalty charge to an agency for delaying the agreed time to load or unload shipments by truck TSPs. It is also a penalty charge in some ocean shipping contracts of carriage that take effect after the demurrage time ends.

is an electronic technique for carrying out business transactions (ordering and paying for goods and services), including electronic mail or messaging, Internet technology, electronic bulletin boards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, and electronic data interchange.

is any vessel of foreign registry including vessels owned by U.S. citizens but registered in a foreign country.

is property or goods transported as cargo.

means the transportation document used as a receipt of goods, evidence of title, and a contract of carriage for Government international shipments (see Bill of Lading (BOL) definition).

is an interagency forum to help GSA formulate policy. It provides agencies managing transportation programs a forum to exchange information and ideas to solve common problems. For further information on this council, see website:.

is a substance or material the Secretary of Transportation determines to be an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce, and labels as hazardous under section 5103 of the Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Law (49 U.S.C. 5103). When transported internationally hazardous material may be classified as “Dangerous Goods.” All such freight must be marked in accordance with applicable regulations and the carrier must be notified in advance.

are the personal effects of Government employees and their dependents.

is the movement of freight between cities excluding pickup and delivery service.

is a method of transportation, such as rail, motor, air, water, or pipeline.

is a list of freight rates, taxes, and charges assessed against non-household goods cargo.

is an offer a TSP sends to an agency, containing service rates and charges.

is a written or electronic acknowledgment by the consignee or TSP as to when and where a shipment was received.

means an assigned value of the cargo for reimbursement purposes that is not necessarily the actual value of the cargo. Released value may be more or less than the actual value of the cargo; however, in the event of loss or damage to the shipment, if the released value exceeds the actual value, reimbursement would be the lesser of the two values. When the released value is agreed upon as the basis of reimbursement and the actual value exceeds the released value, the released value is the maximum amount that could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage to the shipments of freight or household goods. When negotiating for rates and the released value is proposed to be less than the actual value of the cargo, the TSP should offer a rate lower than other rates for shipping cargo at full value. The statement of released value may be shown in any applicable tariff, tender, contract, transportation document or other documents covering the shipment.

You may choose to place a TSP in temporary nonuse, suspension, or debarment if performance is unsatisfactory.

####### § 102-117.290 What is the difference between temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment?

(a) Temporary nonuse is limited to your agency and initiated by the agency transportation officers for a period not to exceed 90 days for:

(1) Willful violations of the terms of the rate tender;

(2) Persistent or willful failure to meet requested packing and pickup service;

(3) Failure to meet required delivery dates;

(4) Violation of Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous material regulations;

(5) Mishandling of freight, damaged or missing transportation seals, improper loading, blocking, packing or bracing of property;

(6) Improper routing of property;

(7) Subjecting your shipments to unlawful seizure or detention by failing to pay debts;

(8) Operating without legal authority;

(9) Failure to settle claims according to Government regulations; or

(10) Repeated failure to comply with regulations of DOT, Surface Transportation Board, State or local governments or other Government agencies.

(b) Suspension is disqualifying a TSP from receiving orders for certain services under a contract or rate tender pending an investigation or legal proceeding. A TSP may be suspended on adequate evidence of:

(1) Fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a contract for transportation;

(2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes;

(3) Embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of the TSP as a transporter of the Government's property or the HHG of its employees relocated for the Government.

(c) Debarment means action taken to exclude a contractor from contracting with all Federal agencies. The seriousness of the TSP's acts or omissions and the mitigating factors must be considered in making any debarment decisions. A TSP may be debarred for the following reasons:

(1) Failure of a TSP to take the necessary corrective actions within the period of temporary nonuse; or

(2) Conviction of or civil judgment for any of the causes for suspension.

####### § 102-117.295 Who makes the decisions on temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment?

(a) The transportation officer may place a TSP in temporary nonuse for a period not to exceed 90 days.

(b) The serious nature of suspension and debarment requires that these sanctions be imposed only in the public interest for the Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Only the agency head or his/her designee may suspend or debar a TSP.

####### § 102-117.300 Do the decisions on temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment go beyond the agency?

(a) Temporary nonuse does not go beyond the agency.

(b) Decisions on suspended or debarred TSPs do go beyond the agency and are available to the general public on the System for Award Management (SAM) maintained by GSA at.

####### § 102-117.305 Where do I go for information on the process for suspending or debarring a TSP?

Refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4) for policies and procedures governing suspension and debarment of a TSP.

####### § 102-117.310 What records must I keep on temporary nonuse, suspension or debarment of a TSP?

(a) You must set up a program consistent with your agency's internal record retention procedures to document the placement of TSPs in a nonuse, suspended or debarred status.

(b) For temporary nonuse, your records must contain the following information:

(1) Name, address, and Standard Carrier Alpha Code and Taxpayer Identification Number of each TSP placed in temporary nonuse status;

(2) The duration of the temporary nonuse status;

##### PART 102-118 - TRANSPORTATION PAYMENT AND AUDIT

###### Subpart A - General

###### Subpart B - Ordering and Paying for Transportation and Transportation Services

####### § 102-118.40 How does my agency order transportation and transportation services?

Your agency orders:

(a) Transportation of freight and household goods and related transportation services (e.g., packaging, storage) with a Government contractor-issued charge card, purchase order (or electronic equivalent), or a Government bill of lading for international shipments (including domestic overseas shipments). In extremely limited cases, cash can be used where government payment mechanisms are not available or acceptable.

(b) Transportation of people through the purchase of transportation tickets with a Government issued charge card (or centrally billed travel account citation), Government issued individual travel charge card, personal charge card, cash (in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations), or in limited prescribed situations, a Government Transportation Request (GTR). See the “U.S. Government Passenger Transportation Handbook,” available at.

####### § 102-118.45 How does a transportation service provider (TSP) bill my agency for transportation and transportation services?

The manner in which your agency orders transportation and transportation services determines the manner in which a TSP bills for service. This is shown in the following table:

####### § 102-118.50 How does my agency pay for transportation services?

Your agency may pay for transportation services in three ways:

(a)Your agency is required by statute to make all payments by EFT unless your agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury.

(b)For those situations where EFT is not possible and the Department of the Treasury has issued a waiver, your agency may make payments by check.

(c)In very unusual circumstances and as a last option, your agency payments may be made in cash in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations (31 CFR part 208).

####### § 102-118.55 What administrative procedures must my agency establish for payment of freight, household goods, or other transportation services?

Your agency must establish administrative procedures which assure that the following conditions are met:

(a) The negotiated price is fair and reasonable;

(b) A document of agreement signifying acceptance of the arrangements with terms and conditions is filed with the participating agency by the TSP;

(c) The terms and conditions are included in all transportation agreements and referenced on all transportation documents (TDs);

(d) Bills are only paid to the TSP providing service under the bill of lading to your agency and may not be waived;

(e) All fees paid are accounted for in the aggregate delivery costs;

(f) All payments are subject to applicable statutory limitations;

(g) Procedures (such as an unique numbering system) are established to prevent and detect duplicate payments, properly account for expenditures and discrepancy notices;

(h) All transactions are verified with any indebtedness list. On charge card transactions, your agency must consult any indebtedness list if the charge card contract provisions allow for it; and

(i) Procedures are established to process any unused tickets.

####### § 102-118.60 To what extent must my agency use electronic commerce?

Your agency must use electronic commerce in all areas of your transportation program. This includes the use of electronic systems and forms for ordering, receiving bills and paying for transportation and transportation services.

####### § 102-118.65 Can my agency receive electronic billing for payment of transportation services?

Yes, when mutually agreeable to the agency and the GSA Transportation Audits Division, your agency is encouraged to use electronic billing for the procurement and billing of transportation services.

####### § 102-118.70 Must my agency make all payments via electronic funds transfer?

Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3332,your agency must make all payments for goods and services via EFT (this includes goods and services ordered using charge cards).

####### § 102-118.75 What if my agency or the TSP does not have an account with a financial institution or approved payment agent?

Under 31 U.S.C. 3332,your agency must obtain an account with a financial institution or approved payment agent in order to meet the statutory requirements to make all Federal payments via EFT unless your agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury. To obtain a waiver, your agency must contact:

####### § 102-118.80 Who is responsible for keeping my agency's electronic commerce transportation billing records?

Your agency's internal financial regulations will identify responsibility for recordkeeping. In addition, the GSA Transportation Audits Division keeps a central repository of electronic transportation billing records for legal and auditing purposes. Therefore, your agency must forward all relevant electronic transportation billing documents toor: General Services Administration, Office of Travel, Employee Relocation and Transportation, Attn: Transportation Audits Division, 1800 F Street NW, 3rd Floor, Mail Hub 3400, Washington, DC 20405.

####### § 102-118.85 Can my agency use a Government contractor issued charge card to pay for transportation services?

Yes, your agency may use a Government contractor issued charge card to purchase transportation services if permitted under the charge card contract or task order. In these circumstances your agency will receive a bill for these services from the charge card company.

####### § 102-118.90 If my agency orders transportation and/or transportation services with a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation, is this subject to prepayment audit?

Generally, no transportation or transportation services ordered with a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation can be prepayment audited because the bank or charge card contractor pays the TSP directly, before your agency receives a bill that can be audited from the charge card company. However, if your agency contracts with the charge card or charge account provider to provide for a prepayment audit, then, as long as your agency is not liable for paying the bank for improper charges (as determined by the prepayment audit verification process), a prepayment audit can be used. As with all prepayment audit programs, the charge card prepayment audit must be approved by the GSA Transportation Audits Division prior to implementation. If the charge card contract does not provide for a prepayment audit, your agency must submit the transportation line items on the charge card to the GSA Transportation Audits Division for a postpayment audit.

####### § 102-118.91 May my agency authorize the use of cash?

Yes, in limited circumstances, a Government employee can use cash where government payment mechanisms are not available or acceptable.

####### § 102-118.92 How does my agency handle receipts, tickets or other records of cash payments?

Your agency must ensure that its employees keep the original receipts for transportation purchases over $75.00 made with cash. If it is impractical to furnish receipts in any instance as required by this subtitle, the failure to do so must be fully explained on the travel voucher. Mere inconvenience in the matter of taking receipts will not be considered. These receipts must be saved for a possible postpayment audit by the GSA Transportation Audits Division. If your agency requires the filing of paper receipts, then you must do so. For transportation purchases over $75.00, your agency must ensure that copies of all original papers are retained at your agency.

####### § 102-118.95 What forms can my agency use to pay transportation bills?

Your agency must use commercial payment practices and forms to the maximum extent possible; however, when viewed necessary by your agency, your agency may use the following Government forms to pay transportation bills:

(a) Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, and SF 1113&#x2013;A, Memorandum Copy;

(b) Standard Form (SF) 1103, Government Bill of Lading (used for movement of things, both privately owned and Government property for official uses);

(c) OF 1169, Government Transportation Request (used to pay for tickets to move people); and

(d) Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of Lading (used by the Department of Defense to move private property for official transfers).

####### § 102-118.100 What must my agency ensure is on each SF 1113?

Your agency must ensure during its prepayment audit of a TSP bill that, when required, the TSP filled out the Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, SF 1113, completely including the taxpayer identification number (TIN) and standard carrier alpha code (SCAC).

####### § 102-118.105 Where can I find the rules governing the use of a Government Bill of Lading?

The “U.S. Government Passenger Transportation&#x2014;Handbook” contains information on how to prepare this GTR form. This handbook is available at

####### § 102-118.115 Must my agency use a GBL?

No, your agency is not required to use a GBL and must use commercial payment practices to the maximum extent possible. Effective March 31, 2002, your agency must phase out the use of the GBL for domestic shipments. After this date, your agency may use the GBL solely for international shipments.

####### § 102-118.120 Must my agency use a GTR?

No, your agency is not required to use a GTR. Your agency must adopt commercial practices and eliminate GTR use to the maximum extent possible.

####### § 102-118.125 What if my agency uses a TD other than a GBL?

If your agency uses any other TD for shipping under its account, the requisite and the named safeguards must be in place (i.e., terms and conditions found herein and in the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation&#x2014;Handbook,” appropriate numbering, etc.).

####### § 102-118.130 Must my agency use a GBL for express, courier, or small package shipments?

No, however, in using commercial forms all shipments must be subject to the terms and conditions set forth for use of a bill of lading for the Government. Any other non-conflicting applicable contracts or agreements between the TSP and an agency involving buying transportation services for Government traffic remain binding. This purchase does not require a SF 1113. When you are using GSA's schedule for small package express delivery, the terms and conditions of that contract are binding.

####### § 102-118.135 Where are the mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of bills of lading?

The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of bills of lading are contained in this part and the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation Handbook.”

The TSP, providing service under the bill of lading, must present a legible copy of the bill of lading or an original, properly certified GBL attached to Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment. An agency may choose not to require that an SF 1113 be attached to the bill of lading and invoice if the TSP submits invoices using the agency's approved third-party payment system (TPPS);

(b) The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading. (This is commonly referred to as an alternation of rates);

(c) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering TSP's documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. If loss or damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, the consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last delivering TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the shipment;

(d) The rules and conditions governing commercial shipments for the time period within which notice must be given to the TSP, or a claim must be filed, or suit must be instituted, shall not apply if the shipment is lost, damaged or undergoes shrinkage in transit. Only with the written concurrence of the Government official responsible for making the shipment is the deletion of this item considered to be valid;

(e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on the overcharges made and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982 31 U.S.C. 3717); and

(f) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and the “U.S. Government Freight Transportation&#x2014;Handbook.”

(a) Government travel must be via the lowest cost available, that meets travel requirements; e.g., Government contract, fare, through, excursion, or reduced one way or round trip fare. This should be done by entering the term “lowest coach” on the Government travel document if the specific fare basis is not known;

(b) The U.S. Government is not responsible for charges exceeding those applicable to the type, class, or character authorized in transportation documents;

(c) The U.S. Government contractor-issued charge card must be used to the maximum extent possible to procure passenger transportation tickets. GTRs must be used minimally;

(d) Government passenger transportation documents must be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation Chapters 300 and 301 (41 CFR chapters 300 and 301), and the “U.S. Government Passenger Transportation&#x2014;Handbook”;

(e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on overcharges made hereunder and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982;

(f) The TSP must insert on the TD any known dates on which travel commenced;

(g) The issuing official or traveler, by signature, certifies that the requested transportation is for official business;

(h) The TSP must not honor any request containing erasures or alterations unless the TD contains the authentic, valid initials of the issuing official; and

(i) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and the “U. S. Government Passenger Transportation&#x2014;Handbook.”

####### § 102-118.155 How does my agency handle supplemental billings from the TSP after payment of the original bill?

Your agency must process, review, and verify supplemental billings using the same procedures as on an original billing. If the TSP disputes the findings, your agency must attempt to resolve the disputed amount.

####### § 102-118.160 Who is liable if my agency makes an overpayment on a transportation bill?

If the agency conducts prepayment audits of its transportation bills, agency transportation certifying and disbursing officers are liable for any overpayments made. If GSA has granted a waiver to the prepayment audit requirement and the agency performs a postpayment audit (31 U.S.C. 3528 and 31 U.S.C. 3322) neither the certifying nor disbursing officers are liable for the reasons listed in these two cited statutes.

####### § 102-118.165 What must my agency do if it finds an error on a TSP bill?

Your agency must advise the TSP via statement of difference of any adjustment that you make either electronically or in writing within 7 days of receipt of the bill, as required by the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901,). This notice must include the TSP's taxpayer identification number, standard carrier alpha code, bill number and document reference number, agency name, amount requested by the TSP, amount paid, payment voucher number, complete tender or tariff authority, the applicable rate authority and the complete fiscal authority including the appropriation.

####### § 102-118.170 Will GSA continue to maintain a centralized numbering system for Government transportation documents?

No. For GTRs, GBLs, and commercial TDs, each agency must create a unique numbering system to account for and prevent duplicate numbers.

The audit may also include subsequent adjustments and collection actions taken against a TSP by the Government (31 U.S.C. 3726).

####### § 102-118.405 Who conducts a transportation postpayment audit?

The Administrator of General Services (GSA) has a congressionally mandated responsibility under 31 U.S.C. 3726 to perform oversight on transportation bills. The GSA Transportation Audits Division accomplishes this oversight by conducting postpayment audits of all agencies' transportation bills.

####### § 102-118.410 If agencies perform the mandatory transportation prepayment audit, will this eliminate the requirement for a transportation postpayment audit conducted by GSA?

No, agency compliance to the mandatory transportation prepayment audit does not eliminate the requirement of the transportation postpayment audit conducted by GSA (31 U.S.C. 3726).

####### § 102-118.415 Can the Administrator of General Services exempt the transportation postpayment audit requirement?

Yes. The Administrator of General Services or designee may exempt, for a specified time, an agency or subagency from the GSA transportation postpayment audit oversight requirements of this subpart. The Administrator can also exempt a particular mode or modes of transportation (31 U.S.C. 3726).

####### § 102-118.420 Is my agency allowed to perform a postpayment audit on our transportation documents?

No. Your agency may not perform a transportation postpayment audit unless granted an exemption and specifically directed to do so by the Administrator in lieu of a prepayment audit. Whether such an exemption is granted or not, your agency must forward all transportation documents (TD) to GSA for postpayment audit (see § 102&#x2013;118.35 for definition TD).

####### § 102-118.425 Is my agency required to forward all transportation documents to GSA Transportation Audits Division, and what information must be on these documents?

Furthermore, you should to the extent possible, use electronic form products and services that are based on open standards. However, the use of proprietary products is permitted, provided that the end user is not required to purchase a specific product or subscription to use the electronic Standard or Optional form.

###### § 102-194.40 For what Standard or Optional forms should an electronic version not be made available?

All forms should include an electronic version unless it is not practicable to do so. Areas where it may not be practicable include where the form has construction features for specialized use (e.g., labels), to prevent unauthorized use or could otherwise risk a security violation, (e.g., classification cover sheets), or require unusual production costs (e.g., specialized paper or envelopes). Such forms can be made available as an electronic form only if the originating agency approves an exception to do so. (See the Standard and Optional Forms Procedural Handbook for procedures and a list of these forms).

##### PART 102-196 - FEDERAL FACILITY RIDESHARING [RESERVED]

#### Subchapters H-Z [Reserved]

### Chapters 103-104 [Reserved]

### Chapter 105 - General Services Administration

#### PART 105-1 - INTRODUCTION

##### Subpart 105-1.1 - Regulations System

###### § 105-1.100 Scope of subpart.

This subpart establishes the General Services Administration Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) and provides certain introductory material.

###### § 105-1.101 General Services Administration Property Management Regulations.

The General Services Administration Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) include the GSA property management policies and procedures which, together with the Federal Property Management Regulations, certain regulations prescribed by other agencies, and various GSA orders govern the management of property and records and certain related activities of GSA. They may contain policies and procedures of interest to other agencies and the general public and are prescribed by the Administrator of General Services in this chapter 105.

###### § 105-1.101-50 Exclusions.

(a) Certain GSA property management and related policies and procedures which come within the scope of this chapter 105 nevertheless may be excluded therefrom when there is justification. These exclusions may include the following categories:

(1) Subject matter that bears a security classification;

(2) Policies and procedures that are expected to be effective for a period of less than 6 months;

(3) Policies and procedures that are effective on an experimental basis for a reasonable period;

(4) Policies and procedures pertaining to other functions of GSA as well as property management functions and there is need to make the issuance available simultaneously to all GSA employees involved; and

(5) Where speed of issuance is essential, numerous changes are required in chapter 105, and all necessary changes cannot be made promptly.

(b) Property management policies and procedures issued in other than the FPMR system format under paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, shall be codified into chapter 105 at the earliest practicable date, but in any event not later than 6 months from date of issuance.

###### § 105-1.102 Relationship of GSPMR to FPMR.

(a) GSPMR implement and supplement the FPMR and implement certain other regulations. They are part of the General Services Administration Regulations System. Material published in the FPMR (which has Governmentwide applicability) becomes effective throughout GSA upon the effective date of the particular FPMR material. In general, the FPMR that are implemented and supplemented shall not be repeated, paraphrased, or otherwise restated in chapter 105.

(b) Implementing is the process of expanding upon the FPMR or other Government-wide regulations. Supplementing is the process of prescribing material for which there is no counterpart in the Government-wide regulations.

(c) GSPMR may deviate from the regulations that are implemented when a deviation (see § 105&#x2013;1.110) is authorized in and explicitly referenced to such regulations. Where chapter 105 contains no material implementing the FPMR, the FPMR shall govern.

###### § 105-1.104 Publication of GSPMR.

(a) Most GSPMR are published in theThis practice helps to ensure that interested business concerns, other agencies, and the public are apprised of GSA policies and procedures pertaining to property and records management and certain related activities.

(b) Most GSPMR are published in cumulative form in chapter 105 of title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Theand title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

###### § 105-1.106 Applicability.

Chapter 105 applies to the management of property and records and to certain other programs and activities of GSA. Unless otherwise specified, chapter 105 applies to activities outside as well as within the United States.

###### § 105-1.109 Numbering.

###### § 105-1.109-50 General plan.

Chapter 105 is divided into parts, subparts, and further subdivisions as necessary.

###### § 105-1.109-51 Arrangement.

(a) Parts 105&#x2013;2 through 105&#x2013;49 are used for GSPMR that implement regulations in the corresponding parts of chapter 101. This practice results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of subchapters.

(b) Parts 105&#x2013;50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as part 105&#x2013;54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105&#x2013;735 because the number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission and various civil agencies on this subject.

###### § 105-1.109-52 Cross-references.

(a) Within chapter 105, cross-references to the FPMR shall be made in the same manner as used within the FPMR. Illustrations of cross-references to the FPMR are:

(1) Part 101&#x2013;3;

(2) Subpart 101&#x2013;3.1;

(3) § 101&#x2013;3.413&#x2013;5.

(b) Within chapter 105, cross-references to parts, subparts, sections, and subsections of chapter 105 shall be made in a manner generally similar to that used in making cross-references to the FPMR. For example, this paragraph would be referenced as § 105&#x2013;1.109&#x2013;52(b).

###### § 105-1.110 Deviation.

(a) In the interest of establishing and maintaining uniformity to the greatest extent feasible, deviations; i.e., the use of any policy or procedure in any manner that is inconsistent with a policy or procedure prescribed in the Federal Property Management Regulations, are prohibited unless such deviations have been requested from and approved by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee.

In those circumstances where GSA personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 150.8.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with § 105&#x2013;8.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdnes, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

This part 105&#x2013;54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:

(a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress;

(b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public service in connection with a Federal program;

Operational functions are those specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature;

(h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a source of consensus advice or recommendations;

(i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and

###### § 105-54.303 Fiscal and administrative provisions.

(a) Each HSSO and each Regional Administrator ensures that under established GSA procedures, records are kept that fully disclose the disposition of funds at the disposal of an advisory committee and the nature and extent of the committee's activities.

(b) When GSA is assigned to provide administrative support for a Presidential advisory committee, the Agency Liaison Coordinator in the Office of the Deputy Regional Administrator, National Capital Region, as a part of its support, arranges with the Office of Finance, Office of the Comptroller, for maintaining all financial records.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in a Presidential order, statute, or other authority, the GSA service or staff office sponsoring an advisory committee provides support services for the committee.

(d) The guidelines in paragraph (e) through (l) of this section are established under section 7(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 86 Stat. 773. They apply to the pay of members, staff, and consultants of an advisory committee, except that nothing in this paragraph will affect a rate of pay or a limitation on a rate of pay that is established by statute or a rate of pay established under the General Schedule classification and pay system in Chapter 51 and Subchapter III of Chapter 53 of Title 5, U.S.C.

(e) The members of GSA advisory committee established pursuant to the Administrator's authority under section 205(g) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 486(g)), are not compensated, since, by law, members so appointed shall service without compensation. A person who (without regard to his or her service with an advisory committee) is a full-time Federal employee will normally receive compensation at the rate at which he or she would otherwise be compensated.

(f) When required by law, the pay of the members of GSA advisory committees will be fixed to the daily equivalent of a rate of the General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the members are appointed as consultants and compensated as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, GSA must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory committee. GSA may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for a GS&#x2013;15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated by statute, or the Administrator has personally determined that a higher rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and necessary. Such a determination must be reviewed by the Administrator annually. Accordingly, the Administrator may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the daily equivalent of a rate for a GSA 18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.

(g) The pay of each staff member of an advisory committee is fixed at a rate of the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service pay rate in which the staff member's position would be placed (5 U.S.C. Chapter 51). GSA cannot fix the pay of a staff member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for GS&#x2013;15 unless the Administrator decides that under the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service classification system, the staff member's position should be higher than GS&#x2013;15. The Administrator must review this decision annually.

(1) In establishing compensation rates, GSA must comply with applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative guidelines.

(2) A staff member who is a Federal employee serves with the knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the employee's direct supervisor. A staff member who is a non-Federal employee is appointed under agency procedures, after consultation with the advisory committee.

(h) The pay of a consultant to an advisory committee will be fixed after giving consideration to the qualifications required of the consultant and the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the work. The rate of pay will not exceed the maximum rate of pay which the agency may pay experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and must be in accordance with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative guidelines.

(i) Advisory committee and staff members, while performing their duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem instead of subsistence, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in the Government service.

(j) Members of an advisory committee and its staff who are blind or deaf or who otherwise qualify as handicapped persons (under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794)), and who do not otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102, as an employee of an agency (under section 3102(a)(1) of Title 5), may be provided the services of a personal assistant.

(k) Under this paragraph, GSA may accept the gratuitous services of a member, consultant, or staff member of an advisory committee who agrees in advance to serve without compensation.

(l) A person who immediately before his or her service with an advisory committee was a full-time Federal employee may receive compensation at the rate at which he or she was compensated as a Federal employee.

###### § 105-54.304 Cost guidelines.

(a) The reporting and estimating of the costs of advisory committees include direct obligations for the following items:

(1) Pay compensation of committee members; consultants to the committee; all permanent, temporary, or part-time (GM, GS, WB, or other) positions which are a part of or support the committee; and all overtime related to committee functions (Compensation should reflect actual or estimated Federal person-years or parts thereof devoted to a committee's activities. It includes the compensation of Federal employees assigned to committees, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, from agencies or departments other than to which the committee reports.);

(2) Personnel benefits associated with the above compensation (13 percent of basic payroll);

(3) Travel costs (including per diem) of committee members; consultants; and all permanent, temporary, or part-time positions which are a part of or support the committee;

(4) Transportation of things, communications, and printing and reproduction;

(5) Rent for additional space acquired for committee use;

(6) Other services required by the committee, including data processing services, management studies and evaluations, contractual services, and reimbursable services; and

(7) Supplies, materials, and equipment acquired for committee use.

(b) The reporting and estimating of the cost of advisory committees does not include indirect or overhead costs; e.g., the costs of the committee management system (committee management officers, etc.).

###### § 105-54.305 Renewal of advisory committees.

(a) Each advisory committee being continued is renewed for successive 2-year periods beginning with the date when it was established according to the following, except for statutory advisory committees: (For renewal of statutory advisory committees, see paragraph (b) of this section.)

(1) Advisory committees are not renewed unless there is a compelling need for them, they have balanced membership, and they conduct their business as openly as possible under the law.

(2) The renewal of a committee requires that the responsible HSSO submit to the GSA Committee Management Officer the following:

(i) An updated charter with an explanation of the need for the renewal of the committee. The charter and explanation are furnished 60 calendar days before the 2-year anniversary date of the committee.);

(ii) A letter signed by the HSSO to the Director, Committee Management Secretariat, with information copies to the Administrator and the Deputy Administrator, setting forth:

(A) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and is in the public interest;

(B) GSA's plan to attain balanced membership of the committee; and

(C) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be performed by GSA, another existing GSA advisory committee, or other means such as a public hearing;

(iii) A notice for publication in thedescribing the nature and purpose of the committee and containing a certification by the Administrator that renewing the advisory committee is in the public interest.

(3) On receiving the above documents, the GSA Committee Management Officer submits the renewal letter to the Committee Management Secretariat not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 30 days before the committee expires. Following receipt of the Committee Management Secretariat's views on the committee renewal, the Officer obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and thenotice. The Officer publishes notice of the renewal in theand files copies of the updated charter. The 15-day notice requirement does not apply to committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with the filing of the charter.

(b) Each statutory advisory committee is renewed by the filing of a renewal charter upon the expiration of each successive 2-year period following the date of enactment of the statute establishing the committee according to the following:

(1) The procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to the renewal of a statutory committee except that neither prior consultation with the Committee Management Secretariat nor anotice is required. Accordingly, the letter that paragraph a(2)(ii) requires is sent to the Administrator rather than the Committee Management Secretariat. Due to the nature of a committee the law established, the explanation of the need to continue the committee's existence is less extensive than the explanation for the continuation of a non-statutory committee; and

(2) The GSA Committee Management Officer provides the Committee Management Secretariat with a copy of the filed charter.

(c) An advisory committee required to file a new charter may not take any action other than preparing the charter between the date it is to be filed and the date it is actually filed.

###### § 105-54.306 Amendment of advisory committee charters.

(a) A charter is amended when GSA decides that the existing charter no longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the committee. Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, or they may be major dealing with the basic objectives or composition of the committee. The Administrator retains final authority for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amending an existing advisory committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.

(b) To make a minor amendment, the Administrator approves the amended charter and has it filed according to § 105&#x2013;54.203&#x2013;1.

(c) To make a major amendment, the Committee Management Officer submits an amended charter and a letter to the Committee Management Secretariat, signed by the HSSO with the concurrence of the General Counsel or designee, requesting the Secretariat's views on the amended language, along with an explanation of the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary. The Secretariat reviews the proposed changes and notifies the Committee Management Officer of its views within 15 calendar days of receiving it, if possible. The Administrator has the charter filed according to § 105&#x2013;54.203&#x2013;1.

(d) Amending an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.

###### § 105-54.307 Termination of advisory committees.

(a) The sponsoring HSSO terminates an advisory committee that has fulfilled the purpose stated in its charter. The official takes action to rescind any existing orders relating to the committee and to notify committee members, the GSA Committee Management Officer, and the Committee Management Secretariat of the termination.

(b) Failing to continue an advisory committee by the 2-year anniversary date terminates the committee, unless its duration is provided for by law.

###### § 105-54.308 Responsibilities of the Administrator.

The Administrator must ensure:

(a) Compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this chapter;

(b) Issuance of administrative guidelines and management controls that apply to all advisory committees established or used by the agency;

##### § 105-55.007 Required administrative proceedings.

The General Services Administration is not required to omit, foreclose, or duplicate administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

##### § 105-55.008 No private rights created.

The standards in this part do not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person, nor shall the failure of the General Services Administration to comply with any of the provisions of this part be available to any debtor as a defense.

##### § 105-55.009 Aggressive agency collection activity.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will aggressively collect all debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, GSA. Collection activities will be undertaken promptly, including letters, telephone calls, electronic mail (e-mail), and Internet inquiries, with follow-up action taken as necessary.

(b) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), will be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.

(c) GSA will cooperate with other agencies in their debt collection activities.

(d) GSA will consider referring debts that are less than 180 days delinquent to Treasury or to Treasury-designated “debt collection centers” to accomplish efficient, cost effective debt collection. Treasury is a debt collection center, is authorized to designate other Federal agencies as debt collection centers based on their performance in collecting delinquent debts, and may withdraw such designations. Referrals to debt collection centers shall be at the discretion of, and for a time period acceptable to, the Secretary. Referrals may be for servicing, collection, compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action.

(e) GSA will transfer to the Secretary any debt that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so the Secretary may take appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection action. See 31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of Debts to Treasury for Collection). This requirement does not apply to any debt that&#x2014;

(1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

(2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;

(3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary;

(4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary (see paragraph (d) of this section);

(5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent;

(6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interest of the United States. GSA may request the Secretary to exempt specific classes of debts;

(7) Is in bankruptcy (see § 105&#x2013;55.010(h));

(8) Involves a deceased debtor;

(9) Is owed to GSA by a foreign government; or

(10) Is in an administrative appeals process, until the process is complete and the amount due is set.

(f) Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. The fee may be paid out of amounts collected and will be added to the debt as an administrative cost (see § 105&#x2013;55.016).

##### § 105-55.010 Demand for payment.

(a) Written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, will be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with the General Services Administration (GSA) to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters (usually no more than three, thirty days apart) will depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to GSA's letters, telephone calls, electronic mail (e-mail) or Internet inquiries. In determining the timing of the demand letter(s), GSA will give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to the Department of Justice for litigation, in accordance with § 105&#x2013;55.031. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this part, including immediate referral for litigation.

(b) Demand letters will inform the debtor&#x2014;

(1) The basis and the amount of the indebtedness and the rights, if any, the debtor may have to seek review within GSA (see § 105&#x2013;55.011(e));

(2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, or administrative costs (see § 105&#x2013;55.016);

(3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges (i.e., interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced collection, which generally will not be more than 30 days from the date the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered; and

(4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within GSA.

(c) GSA will exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day they are dated. For the purposes of written demand, notification by electronic mail (e-mail) and/or Internet delivery is considered a form of written demand notice. There is no prescribed format for demand letters. GSA will utilize demand letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable determination of whether the debt can be resolved administratively or must be referred for litigation.

(d) GSA may include in demand letters such items as the willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment; Agency policies with respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and collection agencies; Agency remedies to enforce payment of the debt (including assessment of interest, administrative costs and penalties, administrative garnishment, the use of collection agencies, Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 days will be transferred to the Department of the Treasury for collection; and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver.

(e) GSA will respond promptly to communications from debtors, within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.

(f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time during or after completion of the demand process, if GSA determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures applicable to offset will be followed (see § 105&#x2013;55.011). The availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset and GSA's determination to pursue collection by offset will release the Agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

(g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, GSA will advise each person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This notification will comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp. pp. 157&#x2013;163) and may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this section or in a separate document.

(h) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless the Agency determines the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection activity against the debtor will stop immediately.

(1) A proof of claim will be filed in most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. GSA will refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.

(2) If GSA is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.

(3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, GSA will determine whether its payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies available for offset may be frozen by the Agency until relief from the automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. GSA also will determine whether recoupment is available.

##### § 105-55.011 Collection by administrative offset.

(a)(1) The term “administrative offset” has the meaning provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).

(2) This section does not apply to&#x2014;

(i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404;

(ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);

(iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of the United States;

(iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);

(v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States;

(vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular types of debts; or

(vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.

(3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

(4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not be conducted more than 10 years after the General Services Administration's (GSA's) right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to GSA's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of GSA who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.

(5) In bankruptcy cases, GSA will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.

(b)(1) GSA is required to refer past due, legally enforceable non-tax debts that are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection by centralized administrative offset. Debts that are less than 180 days delinquent also may be referred to the Secretary for this purpose. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for debt certification requirements.

(2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who owe debts referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials include disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Secretary. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt.

(3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice will include a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of GSA as the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within GSA who will respond to questions regarding the offset.

(4)(i) Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor&#x2014;

(A) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, the intention of GSA to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(7); and

(B) The debtor has been given&#x2014;

() The opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records related to the debt;

() The opportunity for a review within GSA of the determination of indebtedness (see paragraph (e) of this section); and

() The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

(ii) The procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be omitted when&#x2014;

(A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;

(B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth inv.995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

(C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, GSA first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, GSA will give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and will promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.

(iii) When GSA previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see, e.g., § 105&#x2013;55.010), the Agency need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.

(5) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, GSA will certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that&#x2014;

(i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

(ii) GSA has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and Agency regulations.

(6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary shall exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when requested in writing by the Administrator. Also, the Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the Administrator.

(7) Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.

(8) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from GSA that the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

(c)(1) Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that GSA conducts, at the Agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation with another agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable non-tax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, GSA may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for GSA to request the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.

(2) Such offsets will occur only after&#x2014;

(i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written certification from GSA that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that GSA has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.

(3) Payment authorizing agencies will comply with offset requests by GSA to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the program of the payment authorizing agency, or would otherwise be contrary to law.

(4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, GSA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.

(d)Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, GSA may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(e)(1) A debtor may seek review of a debt by sending a signed and dated petition for review to the official named in the demand letter. A copy of the petition must also be sent to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) at 1800 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20405.

(2) For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford a debtor a review within the Agency, the hearing official will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the hearing official determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

(3) Witnesses will be asked to testify under oath or affirmation, and a written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701&#x2013;706. Arrangements for the taking of the transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA.

(4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the hearing official will accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

(5) Hearings will be conducted by a Board Judge of the CBCA. GSA must provide proof that a valid non-tax debt exists, and the debtor must provide evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect.

(6) If an oral hearing is provided, the debtor may choose to have it conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location designated by the hearing official, or may choose a hearing by telephone. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

(7) If the debtor is an employee of GSA, the employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.

(8) A written decision will be issued by the hearing official no later than 60 days from the date the petition for review is received by GSA. The decision will state the&#x2014;

(i) Facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;

(ii) Hearing officials analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the debtor's and/or GSA's grounds;

(iii) Amount and validity of the debt; and

(iv) Repayment schedule, if applicable.

(9) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701).

(f)(1) Under certain circumstances, a waiver of a claim against an employee of GSA arising out of an erroneous payment of pay, allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances may be granted in whole or in part.

(2) GSA procedures for waiving a claim of erroneous payment of pay and allowances can be found in GSA Order CFO 4200.1, “Waiver of Claims for Overpayment of Pay and Allowances”.

(3) GSA will follow the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5584 when considering a request for waiver of erroneous payment of travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances.

##### § 105-55.012 Contracting with private collection contractors and with entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the General Services Administration (GSA) may contract with private collection contractors, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover delinquent debts provided that&#x2014;

(1) GSA retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for litigation;

(2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt less the private collection contractor's fee unless GSA has granted such authority prior to the offer;

(3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and

(4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all amounts collected.

(b) GSA will use Governmentwide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. However, GSA may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant to a contract between the Agency and the private collection contractor only if such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to Treasury for debt collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 285.12(e).

(c) GSA may fund private collection contractor contracts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), or as otherwise permitted by law.

(d) GSA may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets of the United States, such as unclaimed assets.

(e) GSA may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), such contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges the Agency for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

##### § 105-55.013 Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges.

(a) Unless waived by the Administrator, the General Services Administration (GSA) will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a non-tax debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. The authority to waive the application of this section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and re-delegated only to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of GSA. GSA may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary may exempt classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards defining when a “delinquency” is “resolved” for purposes of this prohibition. See 31 CFR 285.13.

(b) In non-bankruptcy cases, GSA, when seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims, will consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay such a debt in accordance with GSA regulations or governing procedures. The debtor will be advised in GSA's written demand for payment of the Agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. If GSA makes, guarantees, insures, acquires, or participates in loans, the Agency will consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, or broker from doing further business with the Agency or engaging in programs sponsored by the Agency if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 will be reported to the Treasury. The Treasury will forward notification to all interested agencies that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Government has been revoked by the Treasury.

(c) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges also may extend to GSA programs or activities administered by the states on behalf of GSA, to the extent they affect GSA's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors.

(d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of GSA's intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.

##### § 105-55.014 Liquidation of collateral.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will liquidate security or collateral through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a non-judicial foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.

(b) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.

##### § 105-55.015 Collection in installments.

(a) Whenever feasible, the General Services Administration (GSA) will collect the total amount of a debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, GSA may accept payment in regular installments. GSA may obtain financial statements from debtors who represent they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible (see § 105&#x2013;55.020(g)). When GSA agrees to accept payments in regular installments, a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor will be obtained specifying all of the terms of the arrangement and containing a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default. If the debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which are free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which the debtor owns an equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financing Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the asset until the debt is paid.

(b) The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period.

(c) Security for deferred payments may be obtained in appropriate cases. GSA may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security, at the Agency's option.

##### § 105-55.016 Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the General Services Administration (GSA) will charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. GSA will send by U.S. mail, overnight delivery service, or hand-delivery a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to the Agency, explaining the Agency's requirements concerning these charges, except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges will continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.

(b) GSA will charge interest on debts owed the United States as follows:

(1) Interest will accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law.

(2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest charged will be the rate established annually by the Secretary in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717(a)(1). Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, GSA may charge a higher rate of interest if it is reasonably determined that a higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. GSA will document the reason(s) for a determination that the higher rate is necessary.

(3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, GSA may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest will not be compounded, that is, interest will not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. If a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement will be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.

(c) GSA will assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs will be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined by the Agency.

(d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, GSA will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge will accrue from the date of delinquency.

(e) GSA may increase an “administrative debt” by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. “Administrative debt” includes, but is not limited to, a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts will be computed annually. GSA will use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of the debt.

(f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by GSA will be applied first to outstanding penalties, second to administrative charges, third to interest, and last to principal.

(g) GSA will waive the collection of interest, penalty and administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. GSA may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, GSA may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if the Agency determines that collection of these charges resulted from Agency error, is against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of the United States.

(h) Unless a statute or regulation specifically prohibits collection, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue for periods during which collection activity has been suspended pending Agency review or waiver consideration.

(i) GSA is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law.

##### § 105-55.017 Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

(a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt under this part or other authority, the General Services Administration (GSA) may send a request to the Secretary (or designee) to obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal Revenue Service.

(b) GSA is authorized to use mailing addresses obtained under paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.

##### § 105-55.018 Exemptions.

(a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301), except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to the extent they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.

(b) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 will be determined, collected, compromised, terminated or settled in accordance with regulation published under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 (see 41 CFR part 101&#x2013;41, administered by the Director, Office of Transportation Audits) and are otherwise exempted from this part.

##### § 105-55.019 Compromise of claims.

(a) The standards set forth in this section apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The General Services Administration (GSA) may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General. The Administrator may designate other GSA officials to exercise the authorities in this section.

(b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the Department of Justice. GSA will evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in § 105&#x2013;55.020. If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Agency, GSA will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation Report. The referral will include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice Department approval is not required if GSA rejects a compromise offer.

##### § 105-55.020 Bases for compromise.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may compromise a debt if the full amount cannot be collected because&#x2014;

(1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information.

(2) GSA is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings.

(3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.

(4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court.

(b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, GSA will consider relevant factors such as the following:

(1) Age and health of the debtor.

(2) Present and potential income.

(3) Inheritance prospects.

(4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor.

(5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.

(c) GSA will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using a credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. GSA will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. GSA also may consider uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. A compromise effected under this section will be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.

(d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases will fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the litigative risks involved, GSA will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412 that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.

(e) GSA may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collection justifies enforced collection of the full amount, GSA will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.

(f) GSA generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, GSA will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full original principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, is reinstated. Whenever possible, GSA will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in § 105&#x2013;55.015.

(g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a reasonable time, GSA may obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expenses. GSA also may obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise offers. GSA may use their own financial information form or may request suitable forms from the Department of Justice or the local United States Attorney's Office.

##### § 105-55.021 Enforcement policy.

Pursuant to this section, the General Services Administration may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if the Agency's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, present and future, will be adequately served by the Agency's acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon.

##### § 105-55.022 Joint and several liability.

(a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, the General Services Administration (GSA) may pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. GSA will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

(b) GSA will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release the Agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

##### § 105-55.023 Further review of compromise offers.

If the General Services Administration (GSA) is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, substantive compromise offer on a debt that is within the Agency's delegated compromise authority, it may refer the offer to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of Justice (DOJ), using a Claims Collection Litigation Report accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the debt. DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to GSA with instructions or advice.

##### § 105-55.024 Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

In negotiating a compromise, the General Services Administration (GSA) may consider the tax consequences to the Government. In particular, GSA may consider requiring a waiver of tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor. For information on discharge of indebtedness reporting requirements see § 105&#x2013;55.030.

##### § 105-55.025 Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by the General Services Administration may be implemented by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and all claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction that the debtor may have. In the event a mutual release is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.

##### § 105-55.026 Suspending or terminating collection activity.

(a) The standards set forth in §§ 105&#x2013;55.027 and 105&#x2013;55.028 apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation, the General Services Administration (GSA) may suspend or terminate collection under this part with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency.

(b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with DOJ. If GSA believes suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the Agency will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in DOJ, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. The referral will specify the reasons for the Agency's recommendation. If, prior to referral to DOJ, GSA determines a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the Agency may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.

##### § 105-55.027 Suspension of collection activity.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may suspend collection activity on a debt when&#x2014;

(1) The Agency cannot locate the debtor;

(2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

(3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

(b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, GSA may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection activity and&#x2014;

(1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

(2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or

(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of the debt with interest at a later date.

(c)(1) GSA will suspend collection activity during the time required for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or administrative review of the debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time.

(2) If the statute under which the request is sought does not prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, GSA will use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. Further, GSA ordinarily will suspend collection action upon a request for waiver or review if the Agency is prohibited by statute or regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected prior to Agency consideration of the debtor's request. However, GSA will not suspend collection when the Agency determines the request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.

(d) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a debt will be suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, unless the Agency can clearly establish the automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. GSA will, if legally permitted, take the necessary legal steps to ensure no funds or money are paid by the Agency to the debtor until relief from the automatic stay is obtained.

##### § 105-55.028 Termination of collection activity.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may terminate collection activity when&#x2014;

(1) The Agency is unable to collect any substantial amount through its own efforts or through the efforts of others;

(2) The Agency is unable to locate the debtor;

(3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable;

(4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

(5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or

(6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

(b) Before terminating collection activity, GSA will pursue all appropriate means of collection and determine, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The termination of collection activity does not preclude GSA from retaining a record of the account for purposes of&#x2014;

(1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary determines that such sale is in the best interests of the United States;

(2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

(3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

(4) Screening future applicants of loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges for prior indebtedness.

(c) Generally, GSA will terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. GSA may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, the claims of GSA that it is a known creditor of a debtor may survive a discharge if the Agency did not receive formal notice of the proceedings.

##### § 105-55.029 Exception to termination.

When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, the General Services Administration may refer debts for litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.

##### § 105-55.030 Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

(a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a close out of the debt), the General Services Administration (GSA) will take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as applicable, administrative offset, tax refund offset, Federal salary offset, referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection centers or private collection contractors, credit bureau reporting, wage garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When GSA discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited. Therefore, GSA will make the determination that collection action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. Before discharging a debt, GSA will terminate debt collection action.

(b) Section 3711(i), Title 31, United States Code, requires GSA to sell a delinquent non-tax debt upon termination of collection action if the Secretary determines such a sale is in the best interests of the United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), GSA may not discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) have been met.

(c) Upon discharge of a debt of more than $600, GSA must report the discharge to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P&#x2013;1. GSA may request Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a discharge report to the IRS on the Agency's behalf.

(d) When discharging a debt, GSA will request the GSA Office of General Counsel to release any liens of record securing the debt.

##### § 105-55.031 Prompt referral to the Department of Justice.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will promptly refer to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with § 105&#x2013;55.009 and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with §§ 105&#x2013;55.027 and 105&#x2013;55.028. GSA may refer those debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency. Debts for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, will be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at DOJ, Washington, DC. Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000, or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, will be referred to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the Claims Collection Litigation Report instructions. Debts will be referred as early as possible, consistent with aggressive GSA collection activity and the observance of the standards contained in this part, and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors. GSA will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within one year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, GSA will make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within one year from the date the loan was presented to the Agency for payment or re-insurance.

(b) DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts referred to it pursuant to this section. GSA, as the referring agency, will immediately terminate the use of any administrative collection activities to collect a debt at the time of the referral of that debt to DOJ. GSA will advise DOJ of the collection activities which have been utilized to date, and their result. GSA will refrain from having any contact with the debtor and will direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to DOJ, except as otherwise agreed between GSA and DOJ. GSA will immediately notify DOJ of any payments credited by the Agency to the debtor's account after referral of a debt under this section. DOJ will notify GSA of any payments it receives from the debtor.

##### § 105-55.032 Claims Collection Litigation Report.

(a) Unless excepted by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the General Services Administration (GSA) will complete the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) (see § 105&#x2013;55.019(b)), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will complete all sections of the CCLR appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.

(b) GSA will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions DOJ should take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits the Agency to indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which DOJ may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.

(c) GSA also will use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or terminate Agency collection activity.

##### § 105-55.033 Preservation of evidence.

The General Services Administration (GSA) will take care to preserve all files and records that may be needed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prove their claims in court. GSA ordinarily will include certified copies of the documents that form the basis for the claim in the packages referring their claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will provide originals of such documents immediately upon request by DOJ.

##### § 105-55.034 Minimum amount of referrals to the Department of Justice.

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will not refer for litigation claims of less than $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe. The Department of Justice (DOJ) will notify GSA if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.

(b) GSA will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless&#x2014;

(1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with the Agency's policies or programs;

(2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to GSA for enforcement; or

(3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.

(c) GSA will consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys in DOJ prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum amount.

(d) Routine adjustment in pay or allowances that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of the adjustment, or as soon after as possible, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment.

(e) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of the adjustment, or as soon after as possible, the employee is given written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment.

(f) Debts or claims arising from the accrual of unpaid Health Benefits Insurance (HBI) premiums as the result of an employee's election to continue health insurance coverage during periods of leave without pay (LWOP), or when pay is insufficient to cover premiums.

###### § 105-56.005 Employee response.

(a)An employee may submit a request to the appropriate program official who signed the pre-offset notice to enter into a written repayment agreement of the debt in lieu of offset. The request must be made within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105&#x2013;56.004 of this subpart. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the appropriate program official making the notice, and a signed copy must be sent to the appropriate Finance Center serving the program activity. Acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the Agency. An employee who enters into such an agreement may, nevertheless, seek a waiver under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b)An employee may submit a signed waiver request of overpayment of pay or allowances (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716) to the GSA National Payroll Center (NPC). When an employee requests waiver consideration, further collection on the debt may be suspended until a final administrative decision is made on the waiver request. During the period of any suspension, interest, penalties and administrative charges may be held in abeyance. GSA will not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the notices/procedures already provided the debtor prior to a request for waiver.

(c)(1) An employee may seek a reconsideration of GSA's determination regarding the existence and/or amount of the debt. The request must be submitted to the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105&#x2013;56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee must submit a detailed statement of reasons for reconsideration that must be accompanied by supporting documentation.

(2) An employee may request a reconsideration of the proposed offset schedule. The request must be submitted to the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105&#x2013;56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee must submit an alternative repayment schedule accompanied by a detailed statement, supported by documentation, evidencing financial hardship resulting from GSA's proposed schedule. Acceptance of the request is at GSA's discretion. GSA will notify the employee in writing of its decision concerning the request to reduce the rate of an involuntary deduction.

###### § 105-56.006 Petition for pre-offset hearing.

(a) The employee may request a pre-offset hearing by filing a written petition with the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 15 days of receipt of the written notice. The petition must state why the employee believes GSA's determination concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt is in error, set forth any objections to the involuntary repayment schedule, and, if the employee is seeking an oral hearing, set forth reasons for an oral hearing. The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement of collection proceedings.

(b) The employee's petition or statement must be signed and dated by the employee.

(c) Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15-day period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit.

(d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the timeliness is waived, the appropriate program official must&#x2014;

(1) Promptly notify the CBCA and arrange for a hearing official (see § 105&#x2013;56.003(m) of this subpart). The hearing official will notify the employee whether he or she may have an oral or a “paper hearing,” i.e., a review on the written record (see 31 CFR 901.3(e)); and

(2) Provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are based.

(e) If an oral hearing is to be held, the hearing official will notify the appropriate program official and the employee of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The debtor may choose to have the hearing conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location designated by the hearing official, or by telephone. The debtor and any witnesses are responsible for any personal expenses incurred to arrive at a hearing official's office or other designated location (see § 105&#x2013;56.007(c)). All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

(f) If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing official and the appropriate program official at least 3 days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause.

(g) If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing official, does not appear at a scheduled oral hearing, the hearing official will make a determination on the claim which takes into account that party's position as presented in writing only.

###### § 105-56.007 Pre-offset oral hearing.

(a) The Agency, represented by the appropriate program official or a representative of the Office of General Counsel, and the employee, and/or his or her representative, will explain their case in the form of an oral presentation with reference to the documentation submitted. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross-examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify when the hearing official determines the testimony to be relevant and not redundant. All witnesses will testify under oath, with the oath having been administered by the hearing official. A written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701&#x2013;706. Arrangements for the taking of the transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA.

(b) The hearing official will&#x2014;

(1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and

(2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.

(c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.

(d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing when doing so is in the best interests of the employee or the Agency.

(e) Oral hearings may be conducted by telephone at the request of the employee. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

(f) The hearing official may request written submissions and documentation from the employee and the Agency, in addition to considering evidence offered at the hearing.

###### § 105-56.008 Pre-offset paper hearing.

If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the hearing official will issue a decision based upon the record and responses submitted by both the Agency and the employee. See § 105&#x2013;56.006 of this subpart. If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing official, does not provide written submissions and documentation requested by the hearing official, the hearing official will make a determination on the claim without reference to such submissions and documentation.

###### § 105-56.009 Written decision.

(a) Within 60 days of the employee's filing of a petition for a pre-offset hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision setting forth&#x2014;

(1) The facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;

(2) The hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to the employee's or Agency's grounds;

(3) The amount and validity of the debt; and

(4) The repayment schedule, if applicable.

(b) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701).

###### § 105-56.010 Deductions.

(a)Deductions may begin upon the issuance of an Agency decision on a request for reconsideration or waiver (except as provided in § 105&#x2013;56.005(b) of this subpart) or the issuance of a decision in a pre-offset hearing. In no event will deductions begin sooner than thirty days from the date of the notice letter. If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the appropriate program official before the expiration of the period provided for in § 105&#x2013;56.006 of this subpart, then deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing and the final written decision. The appropriate program official will coordinate with the National Payroll Center to begin offset in accordance with the final written decision.

(b)If the employee retires, resigns, or is terminated before collection of the indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be offset from any subsequent payments of any nature. If the debt cannot be satisfied from subsequent payments, then the debt will be collected according to the procedures for administrative offset pursuant to § 105&#x2013;55.011 of this subpart.

(c)A debt may be collected in one lump sum or in installments. Collection will be by lump sum unless the employee is able to demonstrate to the program official who signed the notice letter that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump sum. In these cases, collection will be by installment deductions. Involuntary deductions from pay may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay.

(d)If the debt cannot be collected in one lump sum, the debt will be collected by deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the appropriate program official agree to an alternative repayment schedule. The alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate program official.

(1)Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment normally will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three (3) years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period. Installment payments of less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

(2)GSA will make salary deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.

(e)The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States. GSA will pursue, when appropriate, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.

(f)Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this subpart will be assessed according to the provisions of § 105&#x2013;55.016 of this subpart.

###### § 105-56.011 Non-waiver of rights.

An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

###### § 105-56.012 Refunds.

(a) GSA will promptly refund to the employee any amounts offset under these regulations when a debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation), or GSA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay or withheld from non-salary payments.

(b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this subpart will not bear interest.

###### § 105-56.013 Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

GSA participates in the Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) program (see subparts B and C of this part). In those instances when CSO cannot be utilized (i.e., when another agency does not participate in the program), the following procedures apply:

(a)When GSA is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, GSA will provide the paying agency with a written certification that the debtor owes GSA a debt and that GSA has complied with these regulations. This certification will include the amount and basis of the debt, the due date of the payment, or the beginning date of installment payments, if any.

(b)(1) GSA may use salary offset against one of its employees or cross-serviced agency employees who is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. Any such request must be accompanied by a certification from the requesting agency that the person owes the debt, the amount of the debt and that the employee has been given the procedural rights required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

(2) The creditor agency must advise GSA of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the beginning date of the first installment if it is not the next established pay period.

(3) If GSA receives an improperly completed request, the creditor agency will be requested to supply the required information before any salary offset begins.

(4) If the claim procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been properly completed, deductions will begin on the next established pay period unless a different period is requested by the creditor agency.

(5) GSA will not review the merits of the creditor agency's determinations with respect to the amount and/or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim certification.

(6) If the employee begins separation action before GSA collects the total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:

(i) When possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from GSA in accordance with 41 CFR part 105&#x2013;55.011;

(ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, GSA will certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency and the employee;

(iii) If GSA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, such information will be provided to the creditor agency so a certified claim can be made against the payments.

(7) If the employee transfers to another Federal agency before GSA collects the total amount due the creditor agency, GSA will certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency and the employee. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure that collection action is resumed by the new employing agency.

##### Subpart B - Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) Procedures - GSA as Creditor Agency

###### § 105-56.014 Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS) administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government. This process is known as centralized salary offset. Rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal agencies must follow prior to conducting salary offset and the procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency. See 5 CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.

(b) This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 5514 (a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees who owe delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of centralized salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors whose Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government.

(c) This subpart specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching process. For purposes of this subpart, delinquent debt records consist of the debt information submitted to FMS for purposes of administrative offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Since GSA submits debts to FMS for purposes of administrative offset, the Agency is not required to submit duplicate information for purposes of centralized salary offset computer matching under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and this subpart.

(d) An interagency consortium was established to implement centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the consortium.

(e) The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States. GSA will pursue, when appropriate, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.

###### § 105-56.017 Centralized salary offset computer match.

(a) Delinquent debt records will be compared with Federal employee records maintained by members of the consortium or paying agencies. The records will be compared to identify Federal employees who owe delinquent debts for purposes of collecting the debt by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name of a Federal employee are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a debtor.

(b) As authorized by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), FMS, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary, has waived certain requirements of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, for administrative offset, including salary offset, upon written certification by the Administrator, or the Administrator's delegate, that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. Specifically, FMS has waived the requirements for a computer matching agreement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and for post-match notice and verification contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(p). GSA will provide certification in accordance with the provisions of § 105&#x2013;56.016(b)(3) of this subpart.

###### § 105-56.018 Salary offset.

When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, as required by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), the disbursing official will offset the Federal employee's salary payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt owed by the employee. Alternatively, the paying agency, on behalf of the disbursing official, may deduct the amount of the offset from an employee's disposable pay before the employee's salary payment is certified to a disbursing official for disbursement.

###### § 105-56.019 Offset amount.

(a) The minimum dollar amount referred for offset under this subpart is $100.

(b) The amount offset from a salary payment under this subpart will be the lesser of&#x2014;

The disbursing official will not advise GSA of the source of payment from which the amounts were collected.

###### § 105-56.022 Fees.

Agencies that perform centralized salary offset computer matching services may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services. In addition, FMS, or a paying agency acting on behalf of FMS, may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing the administrative offset program. FMS may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill GSA. Fees charged for offset will be based on actual administrative offsets completed and may be added to the debt as an administrative cost.

###### § 105-56.023 Disposition of amounts collected.

(a) The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under § 105&#x2013;56.022 of this subpart, to GSA.

(b) If an erroneous offset payment is made to GSA, the disbursing official will notify GSA that an erroneous offset payment has been made.

(1) The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to GSA; or

(2) Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, GSA will promptly return to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to GSA have been paid).

(i) The disbursing official and GSA will adjust the debtor records appropriately.

(ii) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this subpart will not bear interest.

FMS may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill the creditor agency. Fees charged for offset will be based on actual administrative offsets completed.

###### § 105-56.033 Disposition of amounts collected.

(a) The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under § 105&#x2013;56.032 of this subpart, to the creditor agency.

(b) If an erroneous offset payment is made to the creditor agency, the disbursing official will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous offset payment has been made.

(1) The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to the creditor agency; or

(2) Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, the creditor agency will promptly return to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to the creditor agency have been paid). The disbursing official and the creditor agency will adjust the debtor records appropriately.

#### PART 105-57 - ADMINISTRATION WAGE GARNISHMENT

##### § 105-57.001 Purpose, authority and scope.

(a) This part provides standards and procedures for GSA to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States.

(b) These standards and procedures are authorized under the wage garnishment provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and Department of the Treasury Wage Garnishment Regulations at 31 CFR 285.11.

(c)(1) This part applies to any GSA program that gives rise to a delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States and that pursues recovery of such debt.

(2) This part will apply notwithstanding any provision of State law.

(3) Nothing in this part precludes the compromise of a debt or the suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with applicable law. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.

(4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this part does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States.

GSA may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment.

(5) This part does not apply to the collection of delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws. GSA standards and procedures for offsetting Federal wage payments are stated in 41 CFR part 105&#x2013;56.

(6) Nothing in this part requires GSA to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

##### § 105-57.002 Definitions.

(a)as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a claim.

(b)means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal legal holidays. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Federal legal holiday.

(c)means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal holiday.

(d)means an individual who owes a delinquent non-tax debt to the United States.

(e)means any non-tax debt that has not been paid by the date specified in GSA's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement), unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.

(f)means that part of the debtor's compensation (including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For purposes of this part, “amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.

(g)means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government as defined by 31 CFR 285.11(c).

(h)means information retained by GSA indicating the nature of the document to which it pertains, the date of submission of the document, and to whom the document is being submitted. Evidence of service may be retained electronically or otherwise, so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

(i)means an inability to meet basic living expenses for goods and services necessary for the survival of the debtor and his or her spouse and dependents. See § 105&#x2013;57.010 of this part.

(j) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise stated, the term “Administrator” refers to the Administrator of General Services or the Administrator's delegate.

(k) For the purposes of the standards in this part, the terms “claim” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable.

They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by GSA to be due the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency, from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and forfeitures and all other similar sources, including debt administered by a third party as an agent for the Federal Government. For the purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms “claim” and “debt” include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(l) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise stated, the terms “GSA” and “Agency” are synonymous and interchangeable.

(m) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise stated, “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.

(n)means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to GSA in satisfaction of a withholding order.

(o)means a review of the documentary evidence concerning the existence and/or amount of a debt, and/or the terms of a repayment schedule, provided such repayment schedule is established other than by a written agreement entered into pursuant to this part. If the hearing official determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely by review of the written record, such as when the validity of the debt turns on the issue of credibility or veracity, an oral hearing may be provided.

(p)means a Board Judge of the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA).

(q)means “Wage Garnishment Order (SF 329B)”, issued by GSA. For purposes of this part, the terms “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”

(r) In this part, words in the plural form shall include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude matters not listed but do include matters that are in the same general class.

##### § 105-57.003 General rule.

Whenever GSA determines a delinquent debt is owed by an individual, the Agency may initiate administrative proceedings to garnish the wages of the delinquent debtor.

##### § 105-57.004 Notice requirements.

(a) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, GSA will send, by first class mail, overnight delivery service, or hand delivery to the debtor's last known address a written notice informing the debtor of&#x2014;

(1) The nature and amount of the debt;

(2) The intention of GSA to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and

(3) The debtor's rights, including those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and the time frame within which the debtor may exercise his or her rights.

(b) The debtor will be afforded the opportunity&#x2014;

(1) To inspect and copy Agency records related to the debt;

(2) To enter into a written repayment agreement with GSA under terms agreeable to the Agency; and

(3) To request a hearing in accordance with § 105-57.005 of this part concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. However, the debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(c) The notice required by this section may be included with GSA's demand letter required by 41 CFR 105&#x2013;55.010.

(d) GSA will keep a copy of the evidence of service indicating the date of submission of the notice. The evidence of service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

##### § 105-57.005 Hearing.

(a) GSA will provide a hearing, which at the hearing official's option may be oral or written, if within fifteen (15) business days of submission of the notice by GSA, the debtor submits a signed and dated written request for a hearing, to the official named in the notice, concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment schedules established other than by written agreement under § 105&#x2013;57.004(b)(2) of this part). A copy of the request for a hearing must also be sent to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) at 1800 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20405.

(b)(1) For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the hearing official will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when he/she determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.

(2) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, he/she will establish the time and location of the hearing. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. In-person hearings will be conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, or at another location designated by the hearing official. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

(3) The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the debtor for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, or costs for reproducing documents.

(4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the hearing official will nevertheless conduct a “paper hearing”, that is, the hearing official will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record. The hearing official will establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence.

(c) Subject to paragraph (k) of this section, if the debtor's written request is received by GSA on or before the 15th business day after the submission of the notice described in § 105&#x2013;57.004(a) of this part, the Agency will not issue a withholding order under § 105&#x2013;57.006 of this part until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section has been rendered.

(d) If the debtor's written request for a hearing is received by GSA after the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice described in § 105&#x2013;57.004(a) of this part, GSA may consider the request timely filed and provide a hearing if the debtor can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control. However, GSA will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the Agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or GSA receives information that the Agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.

(e) After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official will notify the debtor of&#x2014;

(1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;

(2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or

(3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written hearing.

(f)(1) GSA will have the burden of establishing the existence and/or amount of the debt.

(2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence and/or amount of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.

(g) The hearing official will arrange and maintain a written transcript of any hearing provided under this section. The transcript will be made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 through 706. All charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing; however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.

(h) The hearing official will issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such hearing was received by GSA. If the hearing official is unable to provide the debtor with a hearing and render a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for such hearing&#x2014;

(1) GSA will not issue a withholding order until the hearing is held and a decision rendered; or

(2) If GSA had previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, the Agency will suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.

(i) The written decision will include&#x2014;

(1) A summary of the facts presented;

(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and

(3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.

(j) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701).

(k) In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at a hearing scheduled pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or to provide written submissions within the time set by the hearing official, will be deemed to have waived his or her right to appear and present evidence.

##### § 105-57.006 Wage garnishment order.

(a) Unless GSA receives information it believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the Agency will send, by first class mail, overnight delivery service or hand delivery, a SF 329A (Letter to Employer & Important Notice to Employer), a SF 329B (Wage Garnishment Order), a SF 329C (Wage Garnishment Worksheet), and a SF 329D (Employer Certification), to the debtor's employer&#x2014;

(1) Within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (i.e., within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice described in § 105&#x2013;57.004(a) of this part); or

(2) If a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a final decision is made by the hearing official to proceed with garnishment.

(b) The withholding order sent to the employer under paragraph (a) of this section will contain the signature of, or the image of the signature of, the Administrator or his or her delegate. The order will contain only the information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. Such information includes the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments are to be sent.

(c) GSA will retain a copy of the evidence of service indicating the date of submission of the order. The evidence of service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

##### § 105-57.007 Certification by employer.

The employer must complete and return the SF 329D (Employer Certification) to GSA within the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.

##### § 105-57.008 Amounts withheld.

(a) After receipt of the garnishment order issued under this part, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (b) of this section. The employer may use the SF 329C (Wage Garnishment Worksheet) to calculate the amount to be deducted from the debtor's disposable pay.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of garnishment will be the lesser of&#x2014;

(1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay; or

(2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment), which is the amount by which a debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.

(c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following will apply:

(1) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued under this part will be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (b) of this section and will have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, withholding orders for family support will have priority over withholding orders issued under this part.

(2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this part, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this part will be the lesser of&#x2014;

(i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or

(ii) An amount equal to 25 percent of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.

(3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to GSA, the Agency may issue multiple withholding orders provided the total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.

(e) The employer shall promptly pay to GSA all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this part.

(f) An employer will not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.

(g) Any assignment or allotment by an employee of his or her earnings will be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order issued under this part, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.

(h) The employer will withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from GSA to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order will indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding, usually the first payday after the employer receives the order. However, if the first payday is within ten (10) days after the receipt of the garnishment order, the employer may begin deductions on the second payday.

(i) Payments received through a wage garnishment order will be applied in the following order:

(1) To outstanding penalties.

(2) To administrative costs incurred by GSA to collect the debt.

(3) To interest accrued on the debt at the rate established by the terms of the obligation under which it arose or by applicable law.

(4) To outstanding principal.

##### § 105-57.009 Exclusions from garnishment.

GSA will not garnish the wages of a debtor who it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing GSA of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.

##### § 105-57.010 Financial hardship.

(a) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order under this part, may, at any time, request a review by GSA of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.

(b) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (a) of this section shall submit the basis for claiming the current amount of garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.

(c) If a financial hardship is found, GSA will downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the Agency, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. GSA will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.

##### § 105-57.011 Ending garnishment.

(a) Once GSA has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with the FCCS, the Agency will send the debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.

(b) At least annually, GSA will review its debtors' accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that have been paid in full.

##### § 105-57.012 Actions prohibited by the employer.

An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a withholding order under this part. See 31 U.S.C. 3720D(e).

##### § 105-57.013 Refunds.

(a) If a hearing official, at a hearing held pursuant to § 105&#x2013;57.005 of this part, determines that a debt is not legally due and owing to the United States, GSA will promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage garnishment.

(b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this part will not bear interest.

##### § 105-57.014 Right of action.

GSA may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with §§ 105&#x2013;057.006 and 105&#x2013;57.008 of this part, plus attorney's fees, costs, and if applicable, punitive damages. However, a suit may not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes of this part, “termination of the collection action” occurs when GSA has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if GSA has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

#### PART 105-60 - PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF AGENCY RECORDS AND INFORMATIONAL MATERALS

##### Subpart A - General Policy

###### § 105-60.000 Scope of part.

This part contains the rules that the U.S. General Services Administration, hereinafter GSA, follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with Privacy Act regulations as well as under this part.

###### § 105.60.001 General policy.

(a) In compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended 5 U.S.C. 552, a positive and continuing obligation exists for GSA to make available to the fullest extent practicable upon request by members of the public, all records and informational materials that are generated, maintained, and controlled by GSA.

(b) This subpart also covers exemptions from disclosure of these records; procedures for the public to inspect or obtain copies of GSA records.

(c) The regulations promulgated in this subpart are consistent with amendments to 5 U.S.C. 552a as well as other applicable Federal laws germane to disclosure of information to the public.

(d) This subpart applies to all GSA organizations, portfolios, business lines, regional offices and components. The aforementioned units may establish additional rules for processing FOIA requests due to unique program requirements; however, such rules shall be consistent with these rules and have the concurrence of the GSA Administrator and GSA Chief FOIA Officer.

(e) Any internal GSA policies or procedures inconsistent with the policies and procedures promulgated in this subpart are superseded by this subpart to the extent of that inconsistency.

(f) This subpart does not entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any GSA records that are not required to be disclosed under the FOIA.

##### Subpart B - Proactive Disclosures

###### § 105-60.100 Public availability of information.

Records that FOIA in 5 U.S. Code section 552(a)(2) requires GSA to make available for public inspection in an electronic format can be accessed via GSA's website at. Additionally, the GSA FOIA Reading Room, and the FOIA Online System. GSA is responsible for determining which of its records shall be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. These records shall be made available electronically via the GSA FOIA Reading Room. GSA shall ensure that its online FOIA Library of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. GSA maintains a FOIA Requester Service Center, the office that oversees FOIA requests for all of GSA, and a FOIA Public Liaison to assist individuals in locating records particular to an agency. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at:.

##### Subpart C - Requirements for Making Requests

###### § 105-60.200 Making a request.

(a) To make a request for GSA records, a requester shall file their request to the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center via one of the following, via the FOIAonline website: (). From FOIAonline you can submit FOIA requests to GSA and other participating FOIAonline agencies, track the status of requests, search for requests submitted by others, access previously released records, and generate agency-specific FOIA processing reports.

(b) If it is not reasonably possible for a requester to submit an electronic request via FOIAonline, the requester shall submit their request via U.S. Mail to the following address: GSA FOIA Requester Service Center (H3), Room 7308, 1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC 20405. Fax: 202&#x2013;501&#x2013;2727. Alternatively, a FOIA requester may email its FOIA request to(Subject: FOIA Request via Email).

(c) FOIA request description

(1) The requester shall provide the following items of contact information when submitting a request to GSA:

(i) Full name with honorific (Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr., etc.);

(ii) Complete mailing address; and

(iii) Telephone number.

(2) This requirement is applicable to both FOIA requests submitted electronically and via U.S. mail, respectively.

(3) Although it is not a mandatory requirement, GSA also recommends the requester provide a personal/business email address for remittance as well.

(d) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself shall comply with the verification of identity requirements as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

(e) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive access to the requested records by submitting: Either a notarized authorization signed by the individual permitting that he or she explicitly grants access to the requested records pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, GSA can require a requester to supply additional information such as a Certification of Identity Form in order to sufficiently verify the individual submitting the request and/or also verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

###### § 105-60.201 Description of records sought.

(a) Requesters shall describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable GSA personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include the following information in their FOIA request, which may help GSA identify the requested records the date/timeframe the requested information was created or occurred, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, contract number, leasing identification number, or reference number and if known, the component of GSA housing the records.

(b) Before submitting a FOIA request, requesters may contact the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center or GSA FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request, GSA determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, GSA shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with their assigned Government Information Specialist or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, GSA's response to the request may be delayed.

(c) In order to efficiently respond to FOIA requests within the required 20-business-day timeframe per 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), GSA may close an unperfected request 10 business days after GSA notifies the requester of the information needed to perfect the request. If the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it is unperfected. A perfected FOIA request is a FOIA request for records that adequately describes the records sought, is made in accordance with GSA's regulations, has been received by the GSA FOIA Requester Service center, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment or amount of applicable fees.

(d) Requesters may specify whether they prefer to receive paper copies of the records or receive the records electronically. GSA shall accommodate the request if the record is readily reproducible in the requested form.

##### Subpart D - Responding to Requests

###### § 105-60.300 Responsibility for responding to FOIA requests.

(a) The GSA FOIA Requester Service Center is responsible for managing all requests for records submitted to GSA from initial receipt of the FOIA request through the agency's final decision to release in whole or in part, or withhold the requested records.

(b) Upon receiving a request for records, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall determine whether the requested records reside within GSA. If GSA does not have ownership of the requested records, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall make a good faith effort to redirect the requester to the appropriate record location or/entity that has control and ownership of the requested record, if known.

(c) If GSA has possession of the requested records, the FOIA Requester Service Center shall work in coordination with the appropriate GSA component/or program office to fulfill the FOIA request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552.

###### § 105-60.301 Acknowledging FOIA requests.

(a) To the extent practicable, GSA shall communicate with requesters electronically via the FOIAonline web portal and/or email.

(b) Upon receipt of a request, GSA shall send requesters an acknowledgement letter within 2 business days containing a brief description of the records sought so requesters may more easily keep track of their requests.

(c) When a request is submitted via FOIAonline, the system automatically generates a tracking number, which allows for easy identification of each request. This tracking number shall be included in the acknowledgement letter.

(d) When GSA receives a request not directly entered by the requester into FOIAonline (email, fax, standard mail, etc.) the FOIA Requester Service Center shall immediately upload the request into the FOIAonline system and it shall be assigned a tracking number that shall be communicated to the requester.

###### § 105-60.302 Responding to FOIA requests.

(a) GSA shall provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, GSA may provide an interim response, meaning the agency releases the records on a rolling basis as the records are located and verified.

(b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency shall include only the records in its possession as of the date the agency receives the perfected FOIA request. If any other date is used, GSA shall inform the requester accordingly. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.

(c) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, GSA is not required to perform the following in response to a FOIA request:

(1) Answer questions or interrogatories posed as FOIA requests;

(2) Issue guidance/or opinions;

(3) Analyze and/or interpret documents for a requester;

(4) Create records;

(5) Conduct research; or

(6) Initiate investigations.

(d) The GSA Administrator and GSA Chief FOIA Officer and/or their assigned delegates are authorized to grant or deny any requests for records or portions thereof that are generated, maintained, or controlled by GSA.

###### § 105-60.303 Consultation, referral, and coordination.

(a) All consultations and referrals received by GSA shall be handled according to the date the other agency received the perfected FOIA request.

(b) GSA may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

(c) When GSA is reviewing records located in response to a FOIA request, GSA shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine if the records are releasable under the FOIA. As to any such record, GSA shall proceed in one of the following ways:

(1)When GSA receives a request for records that either originated with another agency or is a GSA record that includes information that originated with another agency, GSA should typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.

(2)(i) Whenever GSA receives a request for records that are known to be the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding records to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that created the records is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if GSA and the originating agency jointly agree that GSA is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the responsive record(s) may be handled as a consultation.

(ii) Whenever GSA refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a record request to another agency, GSA shall maintain documentation that the referral to the other agency has occurred, and shall notify the requester of the referral. The notification to the requester shall include both the name of the agency to which the record request was referred and the contact information for the agency's FOIA office/or personnel.

(iii) This referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could reasonably harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. If a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if GSA locates a record that originates with an intelligence community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. Records meeting these criteria shall be treated as a consultation.

(iv) In such instances, in order to avoid a harm to an interest protected by an FOIA applicable exemption, GSA should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by GSA.

(4)(i) On receipt of any request involving classified information, GSA shall determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, GSA shall refer request for records to the agency that classified the information or that should consider the information for classification.

(ii) Whenever GSA's records contain information that has been derivatively classified (it contains information classified by another agency), GSA shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the information.

###### § 105-60.304 Time requirements to respond to FOIA requests.

(a) Upon receipt of perfected request via U.S. mail, email, or facsimile, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall begin processing the request for records. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i), GSA has 20 business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) to inform the requester of the agency's determination with respect to the request for records, unless in the alternative, the agency has negotiated a different timeframe based on scope and level of effort to prepare the FOIA request response. If a requester does not receive a response to their perfected FOIA request within the statutory timeframe requester may seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, or where the records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

(b) GSA shall to the greatest extent practicable respond to FOIA requests by order of receipt of the requests.

(c) GSA shall designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in this subpart. GSA may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors GSA may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. GSA shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls upon request, and when appropriate, offer the requester an opportunity to narrow the scope and/or modify their requests.

(d) GSA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests for records were submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert for the same, or similar information to ensure it is fulfilled in a timely manner. GSA cannot aggregate multiple requests for unrelated subject matters.

###### § 105-60.305 Unusual circumstances.

Whenever GSA cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(iii), GSA shall, before expiration of the 20-day statutory time period to respond to a request for records, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which GSA estimates the processing of the request shall be completed. Where the extension of time is anticipated to exceed 10 business days, GSA shall provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. GSA shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. GSA shall also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.

###### § 105-60.306 Expedited processing.

(a) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. In order to qualify for consideration for expedited processing, the request shall reasonably describe the records sought. Expedited requests should be described in sufficient detail to facilitate expedited processing.

(b) A requester who seeks expedited processing shall submit a statement with their FOIA request, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. As a matter of administrative discretion, GSA may waive the formal certification requirement.

(c) GSA may process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information; or

(3) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

(4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Government's integrity that affect public confidence.

(d) GSA shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing and of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, GSA shall act on any appeal of that decision within 3 business days.

##### Subpart E - Acknowledging the FOIA Request

###### § 105-60.400 Applying FOIA exemptions.

(a) 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)&#x2013;(9) of the Freedom of Information Act provides that the disclosure requirements of FOIA do not apply to matters that are:

(1) Specifically authorized under the criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order (see Executive Order No. 13,526);

(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)&#x2013;(9), provided that such statute:

(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue;

(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that could harm the competitive posture or business interests of a company;

(5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:

(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;

(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(iv) Reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;

(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or

(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

(b) GSA will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record to a requester after redacting the portions of the requested records that are exempt under this section.

##### Subpart F - Final Responses to the FOIA Request

###### § 105-60.500 Final response procedures and rules.

(a) Once GSA determines that it shall grant a request in full or in part, the requester shall be notified of the decision in writing as well. GSA shall also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 105&#x2013;60.804 of this part and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The agency shall inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

(b) If GSA makes an adverse determination on any part of the FOIA request, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include determinations that:

(1) The requested record is exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part;

(2) The FOIA request does not reasonably describe the records sought;

(3) The information requested is not subject to FOIA;

(4) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or

(5) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.

(c) Records disclosed in part in response to a FOIA request shall be marked clearly to show the exemption under which the applicable portions of the responsive records were redacted unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

(d) Adverse determinations also include denials involving fee waiver requests, denials for expedited processing, and the administrative closure of FOIA requests due to nonpayment of search and review fees for processing the FOIA request.

(e) Any adverse determination of a FOIA request, in full or in part, shall be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee and shall include:

(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the adverse determination;

(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption that is the basis for GSA's decision;

(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and

(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart I of this part, and a description of the appeal requirements.

(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.

(f) Use of record exclusions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c):

(1) In the event that GSA identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), GSA shall confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.

(2) If GSA invokes an exclusion, it shall maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.

##### Subpart G - Handling Confidential Commercial Information

###### § 105-60.600 Procedural and lawful considerations.

(a) Confidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by GSA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

(b) Submitter means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

(c) A submitter of confidential commercial information shall use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings/or redact any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

(d) When notice to submitters is required:

(1) GSA shall promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if GSA determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

(ii) GSA has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, GSA may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.

(e) The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

(1) GSA determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore shall not be disclosed;

(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12,600 of June 23, 1987; or

(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, GSA shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date.

###### § 105-60.601 Submitter's opportunity to object to disclosure.

(a) GSA shall provide a submitter with 10 business days, within which the submitter shall respond to the notice referenced in § 105&#x2013;60.600.

(b) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide GSA a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as the basis for nondisclosure, the submitter shall explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and the harm of the release of the information to the submitter.

(c) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information.

(d) GSA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

(e) GSA shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

(f) Whenever GSA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the agency shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:

(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the agency intends to release them; and

(3) The specified disclosure date.

(g) Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, GSA shall promptly notify the submitter.

(h) GSA shall notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

##### Subpart I - Appeals

###### § 105-60.700 Submitting an appeal.

(a) A requester may appeal any adverse determination (denial of access to records, denial of fee waiver, or denial of expedited processing, etc.) to the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center which is designated as the agency's FOIA Appeals Office.

(b) The appeal shall include:

(1) The FOIAonline tracking number;

(2) The basis for disagreement with GSA's adverse determination that is being appealed; and

(3) A brief statement of the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records or provide expedited processing and enclose copies of the initial request and denial.

(c) The requester may submit the appeal electronically to. The requester should mark the subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” In the alternative, the requester may submit an appeal via facsimile to 202&#x2013;501&#x2013;2727, or via US mail to U.S. General Services Administration, FOIA Requester Service Center (H3), 1800 F Street NW, 7308, Washington, DC 20405&#x2013;0001. If the appeal is submitted via US mail, the appeal letter must include the words “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” on both the face of the appeal letter and on the envelope. Failure to follow these procedures will delay processing of the appeal.

(d) The GSA FOIA Officer must receive the requester's appeal no later than 90 calendar days after receipt by the requester of any adverse determination by GSA with respect to the FOIA request. GSA has 20 business days after receipt of a proper appeal to issue a response to the requester's appeal. The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA FOIA Officer receives the appeal. As noted in § 105.60.305 of this part, the GSA FOIA Officer may extend this time limit in unusual circumstances. GSA will process appeals of denials of expedited processing as soon as possible after receiving them. The GSA FOIA Officer may also extend the time limit in the event of unusual circumstances occur during the processing of appeals as well.

###### § 105-60.701 Adjudication of appeals.

(a) The GSA Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee shall act on behalf of GSA on all appeals under this section.

(b) An appeal ordinarily shall not be adjudicated if the request that is the subject of the appeal becomes a matter of FOIA litigation. GSA shall administratively close the appeal if it becomes the subject of litigation and provide this notice to the requester in writing that the request has been administratively closed.

(c) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, GSA shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.

(d) GSA shall provide its review and decision on any appeal in writing. Any decision that either upholds GSA's original determination in whole or in part shall contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied.

(e) If GSA's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, GSA shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. GSA shall then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and shall respond directly to the requester. If GSA affirms its original decision after timely receipt of an appeal, GSA shall inform the requester via writing as well. GSA shall inform the requester of their right to seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, or where the records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. GSA shall also inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

(f) Engaging in dispute resolution or mediation services provided by OGIS is a voluntary process. Mediation is a voluntary process. If GSA agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

###### § 105-60.702 Requirements to preserve FOIA records.

GSA shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the NARA. GSA shall not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under FOIA.

##### Subpart J - Fees

###### § 105-60.800 General provisions.

(a) GSA shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

(1) Commercial use requesters;

(2) Noncommercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

(3) All other requesters.

(b) Fees are assessed depending on the category GSA determines the requester falls under in subpart A of this part. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. GSA shall consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in § 105&#x2013;60.807 of this subpart. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, GSA may contact a requester for additional information. GSA shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication of FOIA records are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner.

(c) GSA shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters pay fees by check, credit card, or money order made payable to the U.S. General Services Administration, or by another method as determined by GSA.

###### § 105-60.801 Definitions pertaining to fee assessments.

(a) A commercial use request is a request that asks for information that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. GSA's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category shall be made on a case-by-case basis and is based on the requester's intended use of the information. GSA shall notify requesters of their placement in this category.

(b) Direct costs are those expenses that GSA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus sixteen (16) percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space or the heating or lighting of a facility.

(c) Duplication is reproducing a record to respond to a FOIA request. Duplicating records can occur via paper, audiovisual materials or electronic records.

(d) An educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category shall show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Agencies may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.

(e) A noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis. The term `commercial' for purposes of this subpart is that which is defined in paragraph (a) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category shall show that the request is authorized by a qualifying noncommercial institution, or educational institution of vocational and higher learning and where the records are sought to further scientific, or academic scholarly research, and are not for a commercial use. GSA shall advise requesters of their placement in this category.

(f) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, GSA can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. GSA shall advise requesters of their placement in this category.

(g) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes the process of reviewing each individual record for possible redactions and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 105&#x2013;60.601 of this part. It does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

(h) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

###### § 105-60.802 Fees to be charged.

In responding to FOIA requests, GSA shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 105&#x2013;60.807 of this subpart. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, GSA shall not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

(a)(1) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. GSA shall charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the rules and restrictions enumerated in this subpart. GSA may properly charge for time spent searching even if the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center does not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

(2) For each half hour (30 minutes) spent by GSA personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, a $24.50 fee shall be assessed per the guidelines of the fee schedule enumerated in § 105&#x2013;60.804 of this subpart.

(3) GSA shall charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. GSA shall notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester shall agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

(4) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by GSA at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, GSA shall charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

(b)(1) GSA shall charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of § 105&#x2013;60.803 of this subpart. GSA shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the agency can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, GSA shall provide one copy per request at the cost of $0.10 per copy. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, GSA shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time.

(2) Where paper documents shall be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, GSA shall charge the direct costs.

(3) GSA determines the standard fee for duplication of records as follows:

(i) Per copy of each page (not larger than 8.5 x 14 inches) reproduced by photocopy or similar means (includes costs of personnel and equipment)&#x2014;U.S. $0.10.

(ii) Per copy prepared by any other method of duplication&#x2014;actual direct cost of production.

(c)GSA shall charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed based upon the initial review of the record (the review conducted by GSA to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record). No charge shall be made for review during the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with GSA or another agency's secondary review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those enumerated in the fee schedule of this section.

###### § 105-60.803 Restrictions on charging fees.

(a) When GSA determines that a requester is an educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and that the records are not sought for commercial use, GSA shall not charge search fees.

(b) If GSA fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request for agency records under FOIA, it will not charge search fees, or in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. GSA will charge duplication fees in accordance with § 105&#x2013;60.802(b)(1) through (3) of this subpart.

(1) If GSA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by FOIA, apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 business days.

(2) If GSA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and that more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, GSA may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. GSA shall have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with FOIA and GSA shall have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

(3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

(c) No search or review fees shall be charged for a half-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

(d) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, GSA shall provide without charge:

(1) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

(2) The first 2 hours of search time.

(e) No fee shall be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first 2 hours of search, is equal to or less than $49.00.

###### § 105-60.804 Fee schedule.

Table 1 to § 105&#x2013;60.804 outlines the basic fee categories and applicable fees:

###### § 105-60.805 Anticipated fees.

(a) When GSA determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section shall exceed $49.00, the agency shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated via writing. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, GSA shall advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, 2 hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

(b) If GSA notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $49.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work shall not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay. Or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester shall provide the commitment/or designate an exact dollar amount in writing the requester is willing to pay. GSA is not required to accept payments in installments.

(c) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the agency estimates that the total fee shall exceed that amount, GSA shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. GSA shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester submits the new estimated fee, the time to respond shall resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

(d) GSA's FOIA Public Liaison and other FOIA professionals shall be available to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

(e) Although not required to provide special services, if GSA chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

(f) GSA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date the requester is first billed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the agency. GSA shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&#x2013;365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

(g) When GSA reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert are attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, GSA may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. GSA may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, GSA shall aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

###### § 105-60.806 Advanced payments.

(a) For requests other than those described in this subpart, GSA cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

(b) When GSA determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section shall exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. GSA may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

(c) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to GSA within 30 calendar days of the billing date, GSA may require that the delinquent requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If GSA has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

(d) In cases in which GSA requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work shall not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 10 business days after the date of GSA's fee determination, the request shall be closed.

###### § 105-60.807 Fee waivers and fee reductions.

(a) Requests for a fee waiver shall be made when the FOIA request is first submitted to the agency and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or being reviewed per an appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

(b) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees:

(1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written rationale as to how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; and

(2) GSA shall furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:

(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the request shall concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated; and

(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met; and

(A) Disclosure of the requested records shall be meaningfully informative about Government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

(B) The disclosure shall contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. GSA shall presume that a representative of the news media shall satisfy this consideration;

(iii) The disclosure shall not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, GSA shall consider the following criteria:

(A) GSA shall identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, GSA shall determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. GSA ordinarily shall presume that, when a news media requester has satisfied factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and this paragraph (b)(2), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market Government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

(c) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

##### Subpart K - Other Rights and Services

###### § 105-60.900 Coda.

Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.

The supervisor shall notify the Appropriate Authority. For current or former employees of the Office of Inspector General located in regional offices, Counsel to the Inspector General shall be notified through the immediate supervisor or former employing field office.

(b) The Appropriate Authority shall require that the party seeking material or testimony provide the Appropriate Authority with an affidavit, declaration, statement, and/or a plan as described in paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section if not included with or described in the demand. The Appropriate Authority may waive this requirement for a demand arising out of proceedings to which GSA or the United States is a party. Any waiver will be coordinated with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in proceedings in which GSA, its current or former employees, or the United States are represented by DOJ.

(c)(1)If oral testimony is sought by a demand, the Appropriate Authority shall require the party seeking the testimony or the party's attorney to provide, by affidavit or other statement, a detailed summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the proceedings. Any authorization for the testimony of a current or former GSA employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement or affidavit.

(2) The relevance of the testimony or documents to the proceedings;

(3) The impact of the relevant substantive law concerning applicable privileges recognized by statute, common law, judicial interpretation or similar authority;

(4) The information provided by the issuer of the demand in response to requests by the Appropriate Authority pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section;

(5) The steps taken by the issuer of the demand to minimize the burden of disclosure or production on GSA, including but not limited to willingness to accept authenticated copies of material in lieu of personal appearance by GSA employees;

(6) The impact on pending or potential litigation involving GSA or the United States as a party;

(7) In consultation with the head of the GSA organizational component affected, the burden on GSA which disclosure or production would entail; and

(8) Any additional factors unique to a particular demand or proceeding.

(f) The Appropriate Authority shall not approve a disclosure or production which would:

(1) Violate a statute or a specific regulation;

(2) Reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified by the originating agency;

(3) Reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative agency and the source or informant consent;

(4) Reveal records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes which would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of which would be impaired;

(g) The Appropriate Authority's determination, including any reasons for denial or limitations on disclosure or production, shall be made as expeditiously as possible and shall be communicated in writing to the issuer of the demand and appropriate current or former GSA employee(s). In proceedings in which GSA, its current or former employees, or the United States are represented by DOJ, the determination shall be coordinated with DOJ which may respond to the issuer of the subpoenas or demand in lieu of the Appropriate Authority.

###### § 105-60.1006 Procedure where response to demand is required prior to receiving instructions.

(a) If a response to a demand is required before the Appropriate Authority's decision is issued, a GSA attorney designated by the Appropriate Authority for the purpose shall appear with the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made, and shall furnish the judicial or other authority with a copy of the instructions contained in this subpart. The attorney shall inform the court or other authority that the demand has been or is being referred for the prompt consideration by the Appropriate Authority. The attorney shall respectfully request the judicial or administrative authority to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.

(b) The designated GSA attorney shall coordinate GSA's response with DOJ's Civil Division or the relevant Office of the United States Attorney and may request that a DOJ or Assistant United States Attorney appear with the employee in addition to or in lieu of a designated GSA attorney.

(c) If an immediate demand for production or disclosure is made in circumstances which preclude the appearance of a GSA or DOJ attorney on the behalf of the employee or the former employee, the employee or former employee shall respectfully make a request to the demanding authority for sufficient time to obtain advice of counsel.

###### § 105-60.1007 Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in accordance with § 105&#x2013;60.606 pending receipt of instructions, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions by the Appropriate Authority not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply, citing these instructions and the decision of the United States Supreme Court in United States ex rel.v.340 U.S. 462 (1951).

#### PART 105-62 - DOCUMENT SECURITY AND DECLASSIFICATION

##### Subpart 105-62.1 - Classified Materials

###### § 105-62.101 Security classification categories.

As set forth in Executive Order 12065, official information or material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interests of the national defense or foreign relations of the United States (hereinafter collectively termed “national security”) shall be classified in one of three categories: Namely, Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential, depending on its degree of significance to the national security. No other categories shall be used to identify official information or material as requiring protection in the interests of national security except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. The three classification categories are defined as follows:

(a)Top Secret refers to that national security information which requires the highest degree of protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include armed hostilities against the United States or its allies, disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national security, intelligence sources and methods, and the compromise of vital national defense plans or complex cryptologic and communications systems. This classification shall be used with the utmost restraint.

(b)Secret refers to that national security information or material which requires a substantial degree of protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. Examples of serious damage include disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security, significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security, and revelation of significant military plans or intelligence operations. This classification shall be used sparingly.

(c)Confidential refers to other national security information which requires protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.

###### § 105-62.102 Authority to originally classify.

(a)The authority to originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential may be exercised only by the Administrator and is delegable only to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office.

(b)Delegations of original classification authority are limited to the minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. Delegated original classification authority may not be redelegated.

###### § 105-62.103 Access to GSA-originated materials.

Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the executive branch of the Government without the express permission of the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided in this § 105&#x2013;62.103.

(a)Persons outside the executive branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:

(1) A written determination is made by the Administrator of General Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.

(2) Access is limited to that information over which GSA has classification jurisdiction.

(3) The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be located with a reasonable amount of effort.

(4) The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize a review of his or her notes and manuscript for determination that no classified information is contained therein by signing a statement entitled “Conditions Governing Access to Official Records for Historical Research Purposes.”

(5) An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2 years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions of this § 105&#x2013;62.103(a).

(b)Persons who previously occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the President may not remove classified information or material upon departure from office as all such material must remain under the security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information or material which they originated, received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in public office, provided that the GSA element having classification jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written determination that access is consistent with the interests of national security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the individual seeking access agrees:

(1) To safeguard the information,

(2) To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that no classified information is contained therein, and

(3) To ensure that no classified information will be further disseminated or published.

(c)Classified information will not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an order or subpoena issued by a Federal court, the Administrator may authorize the limited release of classified information if he or she determines that the interests of justice cannot otherwise be served. Appropriate safeguards will be established to protect such classified material released for use in judicial proceedings.

(d)The Archivist of the United States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of General Services in 41 CFR part 105&#x2013;61.

(e)Classified information may be released to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by law.

##### Subpart 105-62.2 - Declassification and Downgrading

###### § 105-62.201 Declassification and downgrading.

(a)The authority to downgrade and declassify national security information or material shall be exercised as follows:

(1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the GSA official authorizing the original classification, by a successor in capacity, by a supervisory official of either, or by the Information Security Oversight Committee on appeal.

(2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised by an official specifically authorized by the Administrator.

(3) In the case of classified information or material officially transferred to GSA by or under statute or Executive order in conjunction with a transfer of functions and not merely for storage purposes, GSA shall be deemed the originating agency for all purposes under these procedures including downgrading and declassification.

(4) In the case of classified information or material held in GSA not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section but originated in an agency which has since ceased to exist, GSA is deemed the originating agency. Such information or material may be downgraded and declassified 30 calendar days after consulting with any other agencies having an interest in the subject matter.

(5) Classified information or material under the final declassification jurisdiction of GSA which has been transferred to NARS for accession into the Archives of the United States may be downgraded and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with Executive Order 12065, directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, and the systematic review guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services.

(6) It is presumed that information which continues to meet classification requirements requires continued protection. In some cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise they shall be referred to the Administrator, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, or in accordance with the procedures for mandatory review described in § 105&#x2013;62.202(b).

(b)Declassification of information shall be given emphasis comparable to that accorded classification. Information classified under Executive Order 12065 and prior orders shall be declassified as early as national security considerations permit. Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information is reviewed for declassification it shall be declassified unless the declassification authority established in § 105&#x2013;62.202 determines that the information continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed despite the passage of time.

(c)Classified information that is marked for automatic downgrading is downgraded accordingly without notification to holders. Classified information that is not marked for automatic downgrading may be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by an official authorized to declassify the same information. Notice of downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information.

###### § 105-62.202 Review of classified materials for declassification purposes.

(a)Except for foreign government information, classified information constituting permanently valuable records of GSA as defined by 44 U.S.C. 2103, and information in the possession and under control of NARA, under 44 U.S.C. 2107 or 2107 note, shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 20 years old. Transition to systematic review at 20 years shall be implemented as rapidly as practicable and shall be completed by December 1, 1988. Foreign government information shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 30 years old.

(b)All classified information upon request by a member of the public or a Government employee or agency to declassify and release such information under the provisions of Executive Order 12065 shall be reviewed by the responsible GSA element for possible declassification in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

(c)Requests for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the following:

(1) Requests originating within GSA shall in all cases be submitted directly to the service or staff office that originated the information.

(2) For expeditious action, requests from other governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to the service or staff office that originated the material, or, if the originating element is not known, or no longer exists, the requester shall submit the request to the GSA Security Officer who shall cause such request to be reviewed.

(d)Requests for declassification review and release of information shall be processed in accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section subject to the following conditions:

(1) The request is in writing and reasonably describes the information sought with sufficient particularity to enable the element to identify it.

(2) The requester shall be asked to correct a request that does not comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to provide additional information.

(3) If within 30 days the requester does not correct the request, describe the information sought with sufficient particularity or narrow the scope of the request, the element that received the request shall notify the requester and state the reason why no action will be taken on the request.

(e)Requests that meet the foregoing requirements for processing will be acted upon as follows:

(1) GSA action upon the initial request shall be completed within 60 days.

(2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged within 7 days.

(3) The designated service or staff office shall determine if the requested information may be declassified and shall make such information available to the requester, unless withholding it is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Deputy Administrator (the notice shall include the Deputy Administrator's name, title, and address), and a notice that such an appeal must be filed with the Deputy Administrator within 60 days in order to be considered.

(f)Except as provided hereinafter, requests for mandatory review for the declassification of classified documents that contain foreign government information shall be processed and acted upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. If the request involves information that was initially received or classified by GSA, then the corresponding service or staff office shall be designated by the GSA Security Officer to determine whether the foreign government information in the document may be declassified and released in accordance with GSA policy or guidelines, after consulting with other agencies that have subject matter interest as necessary. If GSA is not the agency that received or classified the foreign government information, it shall refer the request to the appropriate agency. In those cases where agency policy or guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator, through the GSA Security Officer, may be made prior to final action on the request.

(g)When a service or staff office receives a request for declassification of information in a document which is in the custody of the service or staff office but was classified by another service or staff office or by another Government agency, the service or staff office shall refer the request to the classifying service or staff office or Government agency, together with a copy of the document containing the information requested when practicable, and shall notify the requester of the referral, unless the agency that classified the information objects on the grounds that its association with the information requires protection. When a GSA service or staff office receives such a referral, it shall process the request in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph and, if so requested, shall notify the referring service, staff office, or agency of the determination made on the request.

(h)The following procedures shall be followed when denials of requests for declassification are appealed:

(1) The Deputy Administrator shall, within 15 days of the date of the appeal, convene a meeting of the GSA Information Security Oversight Committee (ISOC) that shall include the GSA Security Officer, or his or her representative, and the GSA official who denied the original request (and, at the option of that official, any subordinates or personnel from other agencies that participated in the decision for denial).

(2) The ISOC shall learn from the official the reasons for denying the request, concentrating in particular upon which requirement continued classification is based and the identifiable damage that would result if the information were declassified. The ISOC shall also learn from the official the part or parts of the information that is classified and if by deleting minor segments of the information it might not then be declassified.

(3) The ISOC's decision to uphold or deny the appeal, in whole or in part, shall be based upon the unanimous opinion of its membership. In the event that unanimity cannot be attained, the matter shall be referred to the Administrator, whose decision shall be final.

(4) Based upon the outcome of the appeal, a reply shall be made to the person making the appeal that either encloses the requested information or part of the information, or explains why the continued classification of the information is required. A copy of the reply shall be sent to the GSA official who originally denied the request for declassification, to the GSA Security Officer, and to any other agency expressing an interest in the decision.

(5) Final action on appeals shall be completed within 30 days of the date of the appeal.

(i)No service of staff office in possession of a classified document may refuse to confirm the existence of the document in response to a request for the document under the provisions for mandatory review, unless the fact of its existence would itself be classifiable.

(a) Addresses disqualified persons only to&#x2014;

(1) Provide for their inclusion in theand

(2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

(b) Does not specify the&#x2014;

(1) GSA transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;

(2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or

(3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 105-68.200 What is a covered transaction?

A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at&#x2014;

(a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

(b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

###### § 105-68.205 Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

(a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

(b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

(c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless&#x2014;

(1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 105&#x2013;68.310 or § 105&#x2013;68.415; or

(2) A(n) GSA official obtains an exception from the Administrator of General Services to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 105&#x2013;68.120.

###### § 105-68.210 Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 105&#x2013;68.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 105&#x2013;68.215. (See appendix to this part.)

###### § 105-68.215 Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

(a) A direct award to&#x2014;

(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

(2) A public international organization;

(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

(c) Federal employment.

(d) A transaction that the General Services Administration needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the General Services Administration specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

(g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.

###### § 105-68.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part&#x2014;

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 105&#x2013;68.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) GSA official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

###### § 105-68.225 How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of GSA Officials Regarding Transactions

###### § 105-68.415 What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

(a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 105&#x2013;68.120.

(b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.

###### § 105-68.425 When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

As an agency official, you must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you&#x2014;

(a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;

(b) Approve a principal in a primary tier covered transaction;

(c) Approve a lower tier participant if agency approval of the lower tier participant is required; or

(d) Approve a principal in connection with a lower tier transaction if agency approval of the principal is required.

###### § 105-68.430 How do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways:

(a) You as an agency official must check thewhen you take any action listed in § 105&#x2013;68.425.

(b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as required by § 105&#x2013;68.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.

###### § 105-68.435 What must I require of a primary tier participant?

You as an agency official must require each participant in a primary tier covered transaction to&#x2014;

(a) Comply with subpart C of this part as a condition of participation in the transaction; and

(b) Communicate the requirement to comply with Subpart C of this part to persons at the next lower tier with whom the primary tier participant enters into covered transactions.

###### § 105-68.440 What method do I use to communicate those requirements to participants?

###### § 105-68.445 What action may I take if a primary tier participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person, you as an agency official may refer the matter for suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any other appropriate remedy.

###### § 105-68.450 What action may I take if a primary tier participant fails to disclose the information required under § 105-68.335?

If you as an agency official determine that a participant failed to disclose information, as required by § 105&#x2013;68.335, at the time it entered into a covered transaction with you, you may&#x2014;

(a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

(b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

###### § 105-68.455 What may I do if a lower tier participant fails to disclose the information required under § 105-68.355 to the next higher tier?

If you as an agency official determine that a lower tier participant failed to disclose information, as required by § 105&#x2013;68.355, at the time it entered into a covered transaction with a participant at the next higher tier, you may pursue any remedies available to you, including the initiation of a suspension or debarment action.

##### Subpart F - General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions

###### § 105-68.600 How do suspension and debarment actions start?

When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.

###### § 105-68.605 How does suspension differ from debarment?

Suspension differs from debarment in that&#x2014;

In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.

(a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.

(b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.

###### § 105-68.615 How does the General Services Administration notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?

(1) You or your identified counsel; or

(2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.

(b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.

###### § 105-68.620 Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.

###### § 105-68.625 What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

(a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited&#x2014;

(1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or

(2) To specific types of transactions.

(b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official&#x2014;

(1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and

(2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.

###### § 105-68.630 May the General Services Administration impute conduct of one person to another?

For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct as follows:

(a)We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

(b)We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.

(c)We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

###### § 105-68.635 May the General Services Administration settle a debarment or suspension action?

Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

###### § 105-68.640 May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

##### Subpart G - Suspension

###### § 105-68.700 When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that&#x2014;

(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 105&#x2013;68.800(a), or

(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 105&#x2013;68.800(b) through (d); and

(c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

###### § 105-68.705 What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

###### § 105-68.710 When does a suspension take effect?

A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

###### § 105-68.715 What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?

(a) That you have been suspended;

(b) That your suspension is based on&#x2014;

(1) An indictment;

(2) A conviction;

(3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government dealings with you; or

(4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;

(c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;

(d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under § 105&#x2013;68.700 for imposing suspension;

(e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;

(2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

(4) All of your affiliates.

(b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the General Services Administration may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.

###### § 105-68.735 Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

(a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that&#x2014;

(4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.

(b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that&#x2014;

(1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

(2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension.

(c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

###### § 105-68.740 Are suspension proceedings formal?

(a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision.

(b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

###### § 105-68.745 How is fact-finding conducted?

(a) If fact-finding is conducted&#x2014;

(1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any witness presented; and

(2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the record.

(b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, unless you as a respondent and the General Services Administration agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase it.

(2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or opposition to, the suspension; and

(3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

(b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

###### § 105-68.755 When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.

###### § 105-68.760 How long may my suspension last?

(a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

(b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

##### Subpart H - Debarment

After consideration of the causes in § 105&#x2013;68.800 of this subpart, if the debarring official proposes to debar you, the official sends you a Notice of Proposed Debarment, pursuant to § 105&#x2013;68.615, advising you&#x2014;

(a) That the debarring official is considering debarring you;

(b) Of the reasons for proposing to debar you in terms sufficient to put you on notice of the conduct or transactions upon which the proposed debarment is based;

(e) Of the governmentwide effect of a debarment from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.

###### § 105-68.810 When does a debarment take effect?

A debarment is not effective until the debarring official issues a decision. The debarring official does not issue a decision until the respondent has had an opportunity to contest the proposed debarment.

###### § 105-68.815 How may I contest a proposed debarment?

If you as a respondent wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or your representative must provide the debarring official with information in opposition to the proposed debarment. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.

###### § 105-68.820 How much time do I have to contest a proposed debarment?

(a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or make arrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to the debarring official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of Proposed Debarment.

###### § 105-68.825 What information must I provide to the debarring official if I contest a proposed debarment?

(a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the debarring official must identify&#x2014;

(1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment. Include any information about any of the factors listed in § 105&#x2013;68.860. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the debarment;

(2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, State, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Proposed Debarment that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

(b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the General Services Administration may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.

###### § 105-68.830 Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which a proposed debarment is based?

(a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that&#x2014;

(1) Your debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment;

(2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment; or

(3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the proposed debarment are not factual in nature, or are not material to the debarring official's decision whether to debar.

(b) You will have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that&#x2014;

(1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

(2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment.

(c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the debarring official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

###### § 105-68.835 Are debarment proceedings formal?

(a) Debarment proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The debarring official may use flexible procedures to allow you as a respondent to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the debarring official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base the decision whether to debar.

(b) You or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the debarring official to consider.

###### § 105-68.840 How is fact-finding conducted?

(a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in § 105&#x2013;68.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at § 105&#x2013;68.860.

(b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes&#x2014;

(1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed debarment;

(2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or in opposition to, the proposed debarment; and

(3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

(c) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any resultant findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

###### § 105-68.850 What is the standard of proof in a debarment action?

(a) In any debarment action, we must establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence.

(b) If the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard of proof is met.

###### § 105-68.855 Who has the burden of proof in a debarment action?

(a) We have the burden to prove that a cause for debarment exists.

###### § 105-68.860 What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.

(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.

(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.

(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.

(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.

(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.

(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.

(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.

(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.

(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.

(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.

###### § 105-68.865 How long may my debarment last?

(a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.

(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 105&#x2013;68.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.

(c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.

###### § 105-68.870 When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

(a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.

(b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 105&#x2013;68.615 that the official decided, either&#x2014;

(1) Not to debar you; or

(2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:

(c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

###### § 105-68.885 May the debarring official extend a debarment?

(a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.

(b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.

(c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to extend the debarment.

Submitting an erroneous certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all available remedies, including those authorized by section 1352, title 31, U.S. Code.

(g) For awards and commitments in process prior to December 23, 1989, but not made before that date, certifications shall be required at award or commitment, covering activities occurring between December 23, 1989, and the date of award or commitment.

(h) No reporting is required for an activity paid for with appropriated funds if that activity is allowable under either subpart B or C.

##### Subpart B - Activities by Own Employees

###### § 105-69.200 Agency and legislative liaison.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 105&#x2013;69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95&#x2013;507 and other subsequent amendments.

(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 105-69.205 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 105&#x2013;69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 105-69.210 Reporting.

No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

##### Subpart C - Activities by Other Than Own Employees

###### § 105-69.300 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 105&#x2013;69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) The reporting requirements in § 105&#x2013;69.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

##### Subpart D - Penalties and Enforcement

###### § 105-69.400 Penalties.

(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

###### § 105-69.405 Penalty procedures.

Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

###### § 105-69.410 Enforcement.

The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.

##### Subpart E - Exemptions

###### § 105-69.500 Secretary of Defense.

(a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

OMB shall provide detailed specifications in a memorandum to these agencies.

(g) Non-major agencies are requested to provide machine-readable compilations to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

(a)(1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.

Other supplementary instructions may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the SF&#x2013;424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.

(4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously submitted pages with information that is still current need not be resubmitted.

###### § 105-71.111 State plans.

(a)The statutes for some programs require States to submit plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” States are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans.

(1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those provisions,

(2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or

(3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.

(d)A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to reflect:

(1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or

(2) A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency operation.

###### § 105-71.112 Special grant or subgrant conditions for “high-risk” grantees.

(1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or

(2) Is not financially stable, or

(3) Has a management system which does not meet the management standards set forth in this part, or

(4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or

(5) Is otherwise not responsible, and if the awarding agency determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be included in the award.

##### Subpart 105-71.12 - Post-Award Requirements/Financial Administration

###### § 105-71.120 Standards for financial management systems.

(a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to&#x2014;

(1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the statutes authorizing the grant, and

(2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.

(b) The financial management systems of other grantees and subgrantees must meet the following standards:

(1)Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial result of financially assisted activities must be made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or subgrant.

(2)Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.

(3)Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.

(4)Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.

(5)Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability and allocability of costs.

(6)Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.

(7)Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.

(c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.

###### § 105-71.121 Payment.

(a)This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.

(b)Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.

(c)Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.

(d)Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.

(e)If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital the awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital, advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.

(f)(1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments for the same activity.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(g)(1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless&#x2014;

(i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions or

(ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.

(2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award conditions, but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 105&#x2013;71.143(c).

(3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.

(h)(1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.

(2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement.

(i)Except for interest earned on advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6501) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses.

###### § 105-71.122 Allowable costs.

(a)Grant funds may be used only for:

(1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and

(2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.

(b)For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles:

###### § 105-71.123 Period of availability of funds.

(a)Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding period unless carryover or unobligated balances are permitted, in which case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from obligations of the subsequent funding period.

(b)A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF&#x2013;269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the grantee.

###### § 105-71.124 Matching or cost sharing.

(a)With the qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following:

(1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or cost-type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by non-Federal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal third parties.

(2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements apply.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.

(2)For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds.

(3)Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract or any other award of Federal funds.

(4)Costs financed by program income, as defined in § 105&#x2013;71.125, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in § 105&#x2013;71.125(g).)

(5)Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.

(6)Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.

(7)(i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs.

(ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect cost. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of contributions.

(iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed price contract may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:

(A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or

(B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.

(iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.

(2)When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.

(d)(1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.

(2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.

(e)If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and the title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:

(1)If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

(2)If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.

(i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

(ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in § 105&#x2013;71.122, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.

(f)If a grantee or subgrantee donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

(g)In some cases under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in the building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

###### § 105-71.125 Program income.

(a)Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them.

(b)Program income means gross income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during the grant period. “During the grant period” is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the final financial report.

(c)If authorized by Federal regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income.

(d)Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.

(e)Income from royalties and license fees for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See § 105&#x2013;71.134.)

(f)Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment will be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 105&#x2013;71.131 and 105&#x2013;71.132.

(g)Program income shall be deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays.

(1)Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.

(2)When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.

(3)When authorized, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.

(h)There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.

###### § 105-71.126 Non-Federal audit.

(a)Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501&#x2013;7507) and revised OMB Circular A&#x2013;133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.

(b)State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:

(1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A&#x2013;110, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;

(2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A&#x2013;110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;

(3) Ensure the appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;

(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and

(5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.

(c)In arranging for audit services, § 105&#x2013;71.136 shall be followed.

##### Subpart 105-71.13 - Post-Award Requirements/Changes, Property, and Subawards

###### § 105-71.130 Changes.

(a)Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.

(b)The applicable cost principles (see § 105&#x2013;71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.

(c)&#x2014;(1)Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:

(i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding.

(ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.

(iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).

(2)Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.

(3)When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.

(d)Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:

(1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).

(2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.

(3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.

(4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of § 105&#x2013;71.136 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.

(e)The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(f)(1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.

(2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see § 105&#x2013;71.122) may be made by letter.

(3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.

###### § 105-71.131 Real property.

(a)Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

(b)Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as needed for that purpose, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.

(c)When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives.

(1)Retain title after compensating the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.

(2)Sell the property and compensate the awarding agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(3)Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property to the current fair market value of the property.

###### § 105-71.132 Equipment.

(a)Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

(b)A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

(c)(1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency.

(2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should be considered if appropriate.

(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 105&#x2013;71.125(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.

(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency.

(d)Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:

(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds the title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the data of disposal and sale price of the property.

(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage or theft of the property. Any loss, damage or theft shall be investigated.

(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.

(5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.

(e)When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:

(1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.

(2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the equipment.

(3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.

(f)In the event grantee or subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment:

(1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.

(2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory listing.

(3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal agency.

(g)The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the following standards:

(1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.

(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the grantee shall follow § 105&#x2013;71.132(e).

(3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.

###### § 105-71.133 Supplies.

(a)Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

(b)If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.

###### § 105-71.134 Copyrights.

The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:

(a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or contract under a grant or subgrant; and

(b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a contractor purchases ownership with grant support.

###### § 105-71.135 Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension”.

###### § 105-71.136 Procurement.

(a)When procuring property and services under a grant, a State will allow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.

(b)(1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.

(2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

(3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:

(i) The employee, officer or agent,

(ii) Any member of his immediate family,

(iii) His or her partner, or

(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agent will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. Grantees and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards of conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the grantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.

(4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.

(5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.

(6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.

(7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.

(8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.

(9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

(10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only&#x2014;

(i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and

(ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.

(11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.

(12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protests to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:

(i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of this section (violations of State or local law will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and

(ii) Violations of grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the grantee or subgrantee.

(c)(1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of § 105&#x2013;71.136. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:

(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business,

(ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,

(iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies,

(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts,

(v) Organizational conflicts of interest,

(vi) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and

(vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.

(2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.

(3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:

(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and

(ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

(4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.

(d)&#x2014;(1)Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.

(2) Procurement by(formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in § 105&#x2013;71.136(d)(2)(i) apply.

(i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:

(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;

(B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively and for the business; and

(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.

(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:

(A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;

(B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;

(C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids;

(D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and

(E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.

(3) Procurement byThe technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:

(i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical;

(ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;

(iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting awardees;

(iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and

(v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.

(4) Procurement byis procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

(i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:

(A) The item is available only from a single source;

(B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;

(C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or

(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

(ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required.

(iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

(e)(1) The grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.

(2) Affirmative steps shall include:

(i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;

(ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;

(iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

(iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

(v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

(vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.

(f)(1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.

(2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

(3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see § 105&#x2013;71.122). Grantees may reference their own cost principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.

(4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.

(g)(1) Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

(2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. when:

(i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or

(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or

(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a “brand name” product; or

(iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or

(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.

(3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.

(i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.

(ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.

(h)For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:

(1)The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

(2)A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

(3)A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

(i)A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.

(1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the simplified acquisition threshold)

(2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)

(3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

(4) Compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). (All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)

(5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a&#x2013;7) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)

(6) Compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327&#x2013;330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of $2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers)

(7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting.

(8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.

(9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data.

(10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

(11) Retention of all required records for three years after grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.

(12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000)

(13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94&#x2013;163, 89 Stat. 871).

###### § 105-71.137 Subgrants.

(a)States shall follow State law and procedures when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:

(1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;

(2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statute and regulation;

(3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with § 105&#x2013;71.142 is placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and

(4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances by Federal agencies.

(b)All other grantees shall follow the provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. Grantees shall:

(1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance with this part;

(2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; and

(3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statutes and regulations.

(c)By their own terms, certain provisions of this part do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:

(1) Section 105&#x2013;71.110;

(2) Section 105&#x2013;71.111;

(3) The letter-of-credit procedures specified in Treasury Regulations at 31 CFR part 205, cited in § 105&#x2013;71.121; and

##### Subpart 105-71.14 - Post-Award Requirements/Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement

###### § 105-71.140 Monitoring and reporting program performance.

(a)Grantees are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, function or activity.

(b)The Federal agency may, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report.

(1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semiannual reports. However, performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the Federal agency.

(2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:

(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.

(ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not met.

(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

(3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

(4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.

(c)For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, and never more frequently than quarterly.

(d)Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become known:

(1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

(2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.

(e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

(f)(1) Federal agencies may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.

(2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee when not needed. The grantee may exend the due date for any performance report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.

###### § 105-71.141 Financial reporting.

(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:

(i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or

(ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit are not used.

(2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more burdensome requirements on subgrantees.

(3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for its decision making purposes.

(4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of forms required under this part.

(5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.

(6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section if not needed.

(7) Federal agencies may extend the due date on any financial report upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.

(b)&#x2014;(1)Grantees will use Standard Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds for all non-construction grants and for construction grants when required in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.

(2)Each grantee will report program outlays and program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(3)The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the report for each project or program. However, the report will not be required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant support.

(4)When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support.

(c)&#x2014;(1)(i) For grants paid by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, Standard Form 272A, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee from this requirement.

(ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may be adapted as appropriated when reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the information to be submitted is not changed in substance.

(2)Forecasts of Federal cash requirements may be required in the “Remarks” section of the report.

(3)When considered necessary and feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess balances.

(4)Grantees must submit the report no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working days following the end of each month.

(d)&#x2014;(1)Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee automatically on a predetermined basis.)

(2)Requests for reimbursement under non-construction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)

(3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in § 105&#x2013;71.141(b)(3).

(e)(1) Grants that support construction activities paid by reimbursement method.

(i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in § 105&#x2013;71.141(d), instead of this form.

(ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated in § 105&#x2013;71.141(b)(3).

(2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.

(i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due date shall be governed by § 105&#x2013;71.141(b) (3) and (4).

(ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be requested on the form specified in § 105&#x2013;71.141(d).

(iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report specified in § 105&#x2013;71.141(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

(3)The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by § 105&#x2013;71.141(b)(2).

###### § 105-71.142 Retention and access requirements for records.

(a)(1) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of grantees of subgrantees or subgrantees which are:

(i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program regulations or the grant agreement, or

(ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program regulations or the grant agreement.

(2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning records in certain kinds of contracts, see § 105&#x2013;71.136(i)(10).

(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided, records must be retained for three years from the starting date specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.

(3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.

(c)&#x2014;(1)When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.

(2)The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency.

(3)In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.

(4)This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rates at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

(i)If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.

(ii)If the proposal, plan, or other computations are not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

(d)Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records.

(e)&#x2014;(1)The awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

(2)The rights of access in this section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are retained.

(f)The Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their records.

###### § 105-71.143 Enforcement.

(a)If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:

(1) Temporary withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency,

(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance,

(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program,

(4) Without further awards for the program, or

(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available,

(b)In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

(c)Costs of grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:

(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,

(2) The cost would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

(d)The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to “Debarment and Suspension” under E.O. 12549 (see § 105&#x2013;71.135).

###### § 105-71.144 Termination for convenience.

Except as provided in § 105&#x2013;71.143 awards may be terminated in whole or in part only as follows:

(a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or

(b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either § 105&#x2013;71.143 or paragraph (a) of this section.

##### Subpart 105-71.15 - After-the-Grant Requirements

###### § 105-71.150 Closeout.

(a)The Federal agency will close out the award when it determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant has been completed.

(b)Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include but are not limited to:

(1) Final performance or progress report.

(2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF&#x2013;271) (as applicable).

(3) Final request for payment (SF&#x2013;270) (if applicable).

(4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).

(5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with § 105&#x2013;71.132(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.

(c)The Federal agency will, within 90 days after receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or downward adjustments to the allowable costs.

(d)(1) The Federal agency will make prompt payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.

(2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants.

###### § 105-71.151 Later disallowances and adjustments.

The closeout of a grant does not affect:

(a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review;

(b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;

(c) Records retention as required in § 105&#x2013;71.142;

(d) Property management requirements in §§ 105&#x2013;71.131 and 105&#x2013;71.132; and

(e) Audit requirements in § 105&#x2013;71.126.

###### § 105-71.152 Collection of amounts due.

(a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by:

(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursement,

(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or

(3) Other action permitted by law.

(b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

##### Subpart 105-71.16 - Entitlements [Reserved]

##### Subpart 105-72.1 - General

###### § 105-72.100 Purpose.

This part establishes uniform administrative requirements for Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in §§ 105&#x2013;72.103, and 105&#x2013;72.204 or unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order. Non-profit organizations that implement Federal programs for the States are also subject to State requirements.

###### § 105-72.101 Definitions.

###### § 105-72.102 Effect on other issuances.

For awards subject to this regulation, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this regulation shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in § 105&#x2013;72.103.

###### § 105-72.103 Deviations.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this regulation when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this regulation shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.

###### § 105-72.104 Subawards.

Unless sections of this regulation specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this regulation shall be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants management common rule, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,” 41 CFR 105&#x2013;71.

##### Subpart 105-72.2 - Pre-Award Requirements

###### § 105-72.200 Purpose.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.201 through 105&#x2013;72.207 prescribes forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for Federal awards.

###### § 105-72.201 Pre-award policies.

(a)In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&#x2013;08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

(b)Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.

###### § 105-72.202 Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

(a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, “Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,” with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF&#x2013;424) series.

(b) Applicants shall use the SF&#x2013;424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.

(c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF&#x2013;424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review.

(d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF&#x2013;424 form should indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372.

###### § 105-72.203 Debarment and suspension.

Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

###### § 105-72.204 Special award conditions.

If an applicant or recipient:

(a) Has a history of poor performance,

(b) Is not financially stable,

(c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this regulation,

(d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or

(e) Is not otherwise responsible;

###### § 105-72.205 Metric system of measurement.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.”

###### § 105-72.206 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&#x2013;580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247 through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

###### § 105-72.207 Certifications and representations.

Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.

##### Subpart 105-72.30 - Post-Award Requirements/Financial and Program Management

###### § 105-72.300 Purpose of financial and program management.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.301 through 105&#x2013;72.308 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.

###### § 105-72.301 Standards for financial management systems.

(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.

(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.

(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 105&#x2013;72.602. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.

(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.

(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&#x2013;453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”

(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.

(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

###### § 105-72.302 Payment.

(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.

(b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and

(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in § 105&#x2013;72.301.

(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.

(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.

(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&#x2013;270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.

(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this section apply.

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.

(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&#x2013;129, “Managing Federal Credit Programs.” Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.

(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use womenowned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).

(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.

(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.

(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.

(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this regulation, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

(1)Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&#x2013;270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&#x2013;271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”

(2)Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&#x2013;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF&#x2013;270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

###### § 105-72.303 Cost sharing or matching.

(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.

(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.

(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.

(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.

(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.

(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.

(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.

(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.

(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.

(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.

(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.

(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.

(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.

(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.

(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.

###### § 105-72.304 Program income.

(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.

(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.

(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.

(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.

(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2), program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).

(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 105&#x2013;72.204.

(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.

(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 105&#x2013;72.400 through 105&#x2013;72.407).

(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.

###### § 105-72.305 Revision of budget and program plans.

(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.

(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

(4) The need for additional Federal funding.

(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency.

(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A&#x2013;21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A&#x2013;122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.

(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.

(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this regulation and OMB Circulars A&#x2013;21 and A&#x2013;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.

(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).

(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.

(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.

(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.

(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.

(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) applies.

(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.

(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.

(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.

(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 105&#x2013;72.307.

(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.

(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.

(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.

(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

###### § 105-72.306 Non-Federal audits.

(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501&#x2013;7507) and revised OMB Circular A&#x2013;133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501&#x2013;7507) and revised OMB Circular A&#x2013;133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

(c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of revised OMB Circular A&#x2013;133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agencies.

(d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as incorporated into the award document.

###### § 105-72.307 Allowable costs.

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&#x2013;87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&#x2013;122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&#x2013;21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.” The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&#x2013;122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.

###### § 105-72.308 Period of availability of funds.

Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.

##### Subpart 105-72.40 - Post-Award Requirements/Property Standards

###### § 105-72.400 Purpose of property standards.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.401 through 105&#x2013;72.407 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of § 105&#x2013;72.401 through § 105&#x2013;72.407.

###### § 105-72.401 Insurance coverage.

Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.

###### § 105-72.402 Real property.

Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.

(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.

(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.

(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.

(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

###### § 105-72.403 Federally-owned and exempt property.

(a)(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.

(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.

(b)When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is “exempt property.” Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

###### § 105-72.404 Equipment.

(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.

(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then

(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.

(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.

(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.

(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.

(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

(i) A description of the equipment.

(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.

(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.

(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

(viii) Unit acquisition cost.

(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.

(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.

(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.

(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.

(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.

(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.

(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.

###### § 105-72.405 Supplies and other expendable property.

(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.

###### § 105-72.406 Intangible property.

(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.”

(c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award.

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of § 105&#x2013;72.404(g).

###### § 105-72.407 Property trust relationship.

Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

##### Subpart 105-72.50 - Post-Award Requirements/Procurement Standards

###### § 105-72.500 Purpose of procurement standards.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.501 through 105&#x2013;72.508 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.

###### § 105-72.501 Recipient responsibilities.

The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

###### § 105-72.502 Codes of conduct.

The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

###### § 105-72.503 Competition.

All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

###### § 105-72.504 Procurement procedures.

(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.

(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.

(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government.

(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.

(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

(iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.

(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.

(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.

(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.

(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.

(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.

(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.

(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”

(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.

(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's implementation of this regulation.

(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.

(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.

(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.

###### § 105-72.505 Cost and price analysis.

Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.

###### § 105-72.506 Procurement records.

Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:

(a) Basis for contractor selection,

(b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and

(c) Basis for award cost or price.

###### § 105-72.507 Contract administration.

A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.

###### § 105-72.508 Contract provisions.

The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.

(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.

(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

##### Subpart 105-72.60 - Post-Award Requirements/Reports and Records

###### § 105-72.600 Purpose of reports and records.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.601 through 105&#x2013;72.603 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

###### § 105-72.601 Monitoring and reporting program performance.

(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in § 105&#x2013;72.306.

(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.

(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.

(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.

(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

(g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.

(h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.

###### § 105-72.602 Financial reporting.

(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.

(1)(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF&#x2013;269 or SF&#x2013;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&#x2013;269 or SF&#x2013;269A when the SF&#x2013;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&#x2013;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&#x2013;269 or SF&#x2013;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&#x2013;270 is used only for advances.

(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF&#x2013;269 or SF&#x2013;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semiannual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.

(2)(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF&#x2013;272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&#x2013;272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.

(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.

(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.

(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&#x2013;272, 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.

(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&#x2013;272 for any one of the following reasons:

(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;

(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,

(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.

(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.

(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.

(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 105&#x2013;72.301, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.

(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.

(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.

(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.

###### § 105-72.603 Retention and access requirements for records.

(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.

(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.

(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.

(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.

(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.

(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.

(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.

(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.

(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

##### Subpart 105-72.70 - Post-Award Requirements/Termination and Enforcement

###### § 105-72.700 Purpose of termination and enforcement.

Section 105&#x2013;72.701 and § 105&#x2013;72.702 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.

###### § 105-72.701 Termination.

(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a) (1) or (2).

(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 105&#x2013;72.801(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

###### § 105-72.702 Enforcement.

(a)If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 105&#x2013;72.204, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.

(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency.

(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

(b)In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

(c)Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.

(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

(d)The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see § 105&#x2013;72.203).

##### Subpart 105-72.80 - After-the-Award Requirements

###### § 105-72.800 Purpose.

Sections 105&#x2013;72.801 through 105&#x2013;72.803 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.

###### § 105-72.801 Closeout procedures.

(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

(c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A&#x2013;129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the Federal awarding agency shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

(f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with § 105&#x2013;72.401 through § 105&#x2013;72.407.

(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

###### § 105-72.802 Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.

(1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.

(5) Records retention as required in § 105&#x2013;72.603.

(b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 105&#x2013;72.803(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

###### § 105-72.803 Collection of amounts due.

(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section.

(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.

(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.

(3) Taking other action permitted by statute.

#### PART 105-74 - GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

##### Subpart A - Purpose and Coverage

###### § 105-74.100 What does this part do?

This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

###### § 105-74.105 Does this part apply to me?

(a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either&#x2014;

(1) A recipient of an assistance award from the General Services Administration; or

(2) A(n) GSA awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 105&#x2013;74.605 and 105&#x2013;74.660, respectively.)

(b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

###### § 105-74.110 Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

This part does not apply to any award that the Administrator of General Services determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

###### § 105-74.115 Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 105&#x2013;74. 510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

##### Subpart B - Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

###### § 105-74.200 What must I do to comply with this part?

There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

(a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to&#x2014;

(1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 105&#x2013;74.205 through 105&#x2013;74.220); and

(2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 105&#x2013;74.225).

(b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 105&#x2013;74.230).

###### § 105-74.205 What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

You must publish a statement that&#x2014;

(a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

(b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

(c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

(1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

(2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

###### § 105-74.210 To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 105&#x2013;74.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

(d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

###### § 105-74.220 By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 105&#x2013;74.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 105&#x2013;74.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

###### § 105-74.225 What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 105&#x2013;74.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must&#x2014;

(1) Be in writing;

(2) Include the employee's position title;

(3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

(4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

(5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_

(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

###### § 105-74.230 How and when must I identify workplaces?

(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each GSA award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces_

(1) To the GSA official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by GSA officials or their designated representatives.

(b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

(c) If you identified workplaces to the GSA awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the GSA awarding official.

##### Subpart C - Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

###### § 105-74.300 What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

As a condition of receiving a(n) GSA award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that&#x2014;

(a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and

(b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

(1) In writing.

(2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

(3) To the GSA awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 105&#x2013;74.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

###### § 105-74.301 [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of GSA Awarding Officials

###### § 105-74.400 What are my responsibilities as a(n) GSA awarding official?

As a(n) GSA awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in&#x2014;

(a) Subpart B of this part, if the recipient is not an individual; or

(b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

##### Subpart E - Violations of this Part and Consequences

###### § 105-74.500 How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Administrator of General Services determines, in writing, that&#x2014;

(a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

(b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

###### § 105-74.505 How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

An individual recipient is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Administrator of General Services determines, in writing, that&#x2014;

(a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart C of this part; or

(b) The recipient is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity.

###### § 105-74.510 What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 105&#x2013;74.500 or § 105&#x2013;74.505, the General Services Administration may take one or more of the following actions&#x2014;

(a) Suspension of payments under the award;

(b) Suspension or termination of the award; and

(c) Suspension or debarment of the recipient under 41 CFR part 105&#x2013;68, for a period not to exceed five years.

###### § 105-74.515 Are there any exceptions to those actions?

The Administrator of General Services may waive with respect to a particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the Administrator of General Services determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.

The system shall be consistent with the terms of the contract; prescribed policies, procedures, regulations, statutes, and instructions; and directions from the contracting officer.

(b) Designated contractors' personal property management systems shall not be considered acceptable until reviewed and approved in writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in accordance with § 109&#x2013;1.5205 of this subpart.

(c) Designated contractors shall maintain their personal property management systems in writing. Revisions to the systems shall be approved in writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in accordance with § 109&#x2013;1.5205 of this subpart.

(d) Designated contractors shall include their personal property management system in their management surveillance or internal review program in order to identify weaknesses and functions requiring corrective action.

(e) Designated contractors are responsible and accountable for all Government personal property in the possession of subcontractors, and shall include appropriate provisions in their subcontracts and property management systems to assure that subcontractors establish and maintain efficient systems for the management of Government personal property in their possession in accordance with § 109&#x2013;1.5204 of this subpart.

####### § 109-1.5202 Establishment of a personal property holdings baseline.

(a) If the contractor is a new designated contractor, the contractor may accept the previous contractor's personal property records as a baseline or may perform a complete physical inventory of all personal property. This physical inventory is to be performed within the time period specified by the contracting officer or the contract, but no later than one year after the execution date of the contract. If the physical inventory is not accomplished within the allotted time frame, the previous contractor's records will be considered as the baseline.

(b) If any required physical inventories have not been accomplished within the time periods prescribed in § 109&#x2013;1.5110(f) of this part, the new contractor shall either perform such physical inventories within 120 days of contract renegotiation, or accept the existing property records as the baseline.

####### § 109-1.5203 Management of subcontractor-held personal property.

Designated contractors shall require those subcontractors provided Government-owned personal property to establish and maintain a system for the management of such property. As a minimum, a subcontractor's personal property management system shall provide for the following:

(a) Adequate records.

(b) Controls over acquisitions.

(c) Identification as Government-owned personal property.

(d) Physical inventories.

(e) Proper care, maintenance, and protection.

(f) Controls over personal property requiring special handling (nuclear-related, proliferation-sensitive, hazardous, or contaminated property).

(a) An initial review of a designated contractor's personal property management system shall be performed by the property administrator within one year after the execution date of the contract, except for contract extensions or renewals or when an existing contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the contractor's system provides adequate protection, maintenance, utilization, and disposition of personal property, and reasonable assurance that the Department's personal property is safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation, in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, contract terms and conditions, programmatic needs, and good business practices. If circumstances preclude completion of the initial review within the “within one year” initial review requirement, the property administrator shall request a deviation from the requirement in accordance with the provisions of § 109&#x2013;1.110&#x2013;50 of this part.

(b) If a designated contractor is the successor to a previous designated contractor and the contract award was based in part on the contractor's proposal to overhaul the existing personal property management system(s), the “within one year” initial review requirement may be extended based on:

(1) The scope of the overhaul; and

(2) An analysis of the cost to implement the overhaul within a year versus a proposed extended period.

(c) When an existing contract has been extended or renewed, or the designated contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract, an initial review of the contractor's personal property management system is not required.

(d) At a minimum of every three years after the date of approval of a designated contractor's property management system, the OPMO/PA shall make an appraisal of the personal property management operation of the contractor. The purpose of the appraisal is to determine if the contractor is managing personal property in accordance with its previously approved system and procedures, and to establish whether such procedures are efficient. The appraisal may be based on a formal comprehensive appraisal or a series of formal appraisals of the functional segments of the contractor's operation.

(e) A designated contractor's property management system shall be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved in writing by the head of the field organization with advice of the contracting officer, property administrator, OPMO, legal counsel, and appropriate program officials. Approval authority may be redelegated to the contracting officer or OPMO/PA. Conditional approval and disapproval authority cannot be redelegated. When a system is conditionally approved or disapproved, the property administrator or contracting officer shall advise the contractor, in writing, of deficiencies that need to be corrected, and a time schedule established for completion of corrective actions.

(f) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator to ensure that corrective actions have been initiated and completed.

(g) When a determination has been made by the property administrator that all major system deficiencies identified in the review or appraisal have been corrected, the head of the field organization shall withdraw the conditional approval or disapproval, and approve the system with the concurrence of the OPMO/PA. The approval shall be in writing and addressed to appropriate contractor management.

(h) The property administrator shall maintain a copy of all designated contractor personal property management system appraisals and approvals in such manner as to be readily available to investigative and external review teams.

####### § 109-1.5205 Personal property management system changes.

Such changes should then be approved in writing on an interim basis, or disapproved in writing, by the property administrator as appropriate.

###### Subpart 109-1.53 - Management of High Risk Personal Property

####### § 109-1.5300 Scope of subpart.

(a) This subpart provides identification, accounting, control, and disposal policy guidance for the following categories of high risk personal property: Especially designed or prepared property, export controlled property, nuclear weapon components or weapon-like components, and proliferation sensitive property. The guidance is intended to ensure that the disposition of these categories of high risk personal property does not adversely affect the national security or nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the United States.

(b) The other categories of high risk personal property are controlled by other life cycle management programs and procedures monitored by other Departmental elements.

####### § 109-1.5301 Applicability.

This subpart is applicable to all DOE organizations which purchase, manage or dispose of Government personal property, or contract for the management of Government facilities, programs, or related services, which may directly or indirectly require the purchase, management, or disposal of Government-owned personal property. Using the high-risk personal property control requirements in this subpart as guidance, Program Secretarial Officer (PSO) or OPMOs/PAs shall ensure that designated contractors and financial assistance recipients are responsible for developing a cost effective high-risk property management system, covering all operational responsibilities enumerated in this subpart.

####### § 109-1.5302 Policies.

(a) It is the responsibility of DOE organizations and designated contractors to manage and control Government-owned high risk personal property in an efficient manner. High-risk personal property will be managed throughout its life cycle so as to protect public and DOE personnel safety and to advance the national security and the nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the U.S. Government.

(b) The disposition of high risk property is subject to special considerations. Items of high risk property may present significant risks to the national security and nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the Government which must be evaluated. Organizations will identify high risk property and control its disposition to eliminate or mitigate such risks. In no case shall property be transferred or disposed unless it receives a high risk assessment and is handled accordingly.

####### § 109-1.5303 Procedures.

(a)To ensure the appropriate treatment of property at its disposal and to prevent inadvertent, uncontrolled release of high risk property, property should be assessed and evaluated as high risk property as early in its life cycle as practical.

(1) Newly acquired high risk personal property shall be identified and tracked during the acquisition process and marked upon receipt.

(2) All personal property shall be reviewed for high risk identification, marking, and database entry during regularly scheduled physical inventories, unless access to the property is difficult or impractical because the property is a component of a larger assembly, a complex operating system, or an older facility. The review of this property will be completed, prior to disposition, when replacing components or when operating systems and facilities are decommissioned and dismantling.

(3) High risk personal property which by its nature cannot be marked, such as stores items and metal stock, is exempt from this requirement. However, personal property management programs should contain documentation on the characterization of this property as high risk.

(b)(1) Prior to disposition, all personal property, materials or data will be assessed to determine:

(i) Whether it should be characterized as high risk, and

(ii) What actions are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable national security or nonproliferation controls.

(2) The DOE or designated contractor property management organization may not process high risk personal property into a reutilization/disposal program without performing the reviews prescribed by the local high risk property management system. The reviews must be properly documented, and all appropriate certifications and clearances received, in accordance with the approved site or facility personal property management program.

(3) The disposition (including demilitarization of items on the Munitions List) and handling of high risk personal property are subject to applicable provisions of subchapter H of the FPMR/FMR, subchapter H of this chapter, and the DOE Guidelines on Export Control and Nonproliferation.

(4) All applicable documentation, including records concerning the property's categorization as high risk, shall be included as part of the property transfer. The documentation shall be included with all transfers within, or external to, DOE.

(5) Unless an alternative disposition option appears to be in the best interest of the Government, surplus Trigger List components, equipment, and materials and nuclear weapon components shall either be sold for scrap after being rendered useless for their originally intended purpose or destroyed, with the destruction verified and documented. Requests for approval of an alternative disposition may be made through the cognizant Assistant Secretary to the Director of the Office of Nonproliferation and National Security.

(6) The following Export Restriction Notice, or approved equivalent notice, shall be included in all transfers, sales, or other offerings:

####### § 109-1.5304 Deviations.

(a) Life cycle control determinations. When the PSO approves a contractor program containing controls, other than life cycle control consistent with this subpart, the decision shall be justified in writing and a copy sent to the Office of Management. A PSO's decision not to provide life-cycle control should take into account:

(1) The nature and extent of high risk property typically purchased or otherwise brought to a DOE or designated contractor facility or site;

(2) The projected stability of DOE and designated contractor operations; and

(3) The degree of confidence in the property control measures available at disposition.

(b) Certain transfers, sales, or other offerings of high risk personal property may require special conditions or specific restrictions as determined necessary by the property custodian or cognizant program office.

(c) Requests for deviations from the requirements of this subpart may be made through the cognizant PSO to the Office of Management.

####### § 109-38.5100 Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the utilization of motor equipment.

####### § 109-38.5101 Policy.

It is DOE policy to keep the number of motor vehicles and other motor equipment at the minimum needed to satisfy programmatic requirements. To attain this goal, controls and practices shall be established which will achieve the most practical and economical utilization of motor equipment. These controls and practices apply to all DOE-owned and commercially leased motor equipment and to GSA Interagency Fleet Management System motor vehicles.

####### § 109-38.5102 Utilization controls and practices.

Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and designated contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of motor equipment shall include, but not be limited to:

(a) The maximum use of motor equipment pools, taxicabs, shuttle buses, or other common service arrangements;

(b) The minimum, practicable assignment of motor equipment to individuals, groups, or specific organizational components;

(c) The maintenance of individual motor equipment use records, such as trip tickets or vehicle logs, or hours of use, as appropriate, showing sufficiently detailed information to evaluate appropriateness of assignment and adequacy of use being made. If one-time use of a motor vehicle is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the motor vehicle and show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure and return, and mileage;

(d) The rotation of motor vehicles between high and low mileage assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy;

(e) The charging, if considered feasible, to the user organization for the cost of operating and maintaining motor vehicles assigned to groups or organizational components. These charge-back costs should include all direct and indirect costs of the motor vehicle fleet operation as determined by the field organization and contractor finance and accounting functions;

(f) The use of dual-purpose motor vehicles capable of hauling both personnel and light cargo whenever appropriate to avoid the need for two motor vehicles when one can serve both purposes. However, truck-type or van vehicles shall not be acquired for passenger use merely to avoid statutory limitations on the number of passenger motor vehicles which may be acquired;

(g) The use of motor scooters and motorcycles in place of higher cost motor vehicles for certain applications within plant areas, such as mail and messenger service and small parts and tool delivery. Their advantage, however, should be weighed carefully from the standpoint of overall economy (comparison with cost for other types of motor vehicles) and increased safety hazards, particularly when mingled with other motor vehicle traffic; and

(h) The use of electric vehicles for certain applications. The use of these vehicles is encouraged wherever it is feasible to use them to further the goal of fuel conservation.

####### § 109-38.5103 Motor vehicle utilization standards.

(a) The following average utilization standards are established for DOE as objectives for those motor vehicles operated generally for those purposes for which acquired:

(1) Sedans and station wagons, general purpose use&#x2014;12,000 miles per year.

(2) Light trucks (4 x 2's) and general purpose vehicles, one ton and under (less than 12,500 GVWR)&#x2014;10,000 miles per year.

(3) Medium trucks and general purpose vehicles, 1ton through 2ton (12,500 to 23,999 GVWR)&#x2014;7,500 miles per year.

(4) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles, three ton and over (24,000 GVWR and over)&#x2014;7,500 miles per year.

(5) Truck tractors&#x2014;10,000 miles per year.

(6) All-wheel-drive vehicles&#x2014;7,500 miles per year.

(7) Other motor vehicles&#x2014;No utilization standards are established for other trucks, ambulances, buses, law enforcement motor vehicles, and special purpose vehicles. The use of these motor vehicles shall be reviewed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager and action shall be taken and documented to verify that the motor vehicles are required to meet programmatic, health, safety, or security requirements.

(b) When operating circumstances prevent the above motor vehicle utilization standards from being met, local use objectives must be established and met as prescribed in § 109&#x2013;38.5105 of this subpart.

####### § 109-38.5104 Other motor equipment utilization standards.

No utilization standards are established for motor equipment other than motor vehicles. Each DOE office should establish through an agreement between the fleet manager and the OPMO utilization criteria for other motor equipment including heavy mobile equipment and review, adjust, and approve such criteria annually. Utilization of various classifications of other motor equipment can be measured through various statistics including miles, hours of use, number of trips, and fuel consumption. A utilization review of other motor equipment shall be performed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager to justify retainment or disposition of excess equipment not needed to fulfill Departmental, programmatic, health, safety, or security requirements.

####### § 109-38.5105 Motor vehicle local use objectives.

(a) Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly, efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The objectives should take into consideration past performance, future requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating requirements.

(b) These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager. The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all proposed local use objectives.

####### § 109-38.5106 Application of motor vehicle use goals.

(a) At least annually, the motor equipment fleet manager will review motor vehicle utilization statistics and all motor vehicles failing to meet the applicable DOE utilization standard or local use objective must be identified.

(b) Prompt action must be initiated to:

(1) Reassign the underutilized motor vehicles;

(2) Dispose of the underutilized motor vehicles; or

(3) Obtain a special justification from users documenting their continued requirement for the motor vehicle and any proposed actions to improve utilization. Any requirement for underutilized motor vehicles which the motor equipment fleet manager proposes to continue in its assignment, must be submitted in writing to the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager for approval.

(c) Both Department-wide standards and local use objectives should be applied in such a manner that their application does not stimulate motor vehicle use for the purpose of meeting the objective. The ultimate standard against which motor vehicle use must be measured is that the minimum number of motor vehicles will be retained to satisfy program requirements.

###### Subpart 109-38.52 - Watercraft

####### § 109-38.5200 Scope of subpart.

This subpart sets forth policies and procedures governing the disposal of DOE-owned foreign excess and surplus personal property.

####### § 109-45.5101 Authority.

The policies and procedures contained in this subpart are issued pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, former 40 U.S.C.., as amended. Title IV of the Act entitled “Foreign Excess Property” provides that, except where commitments exist under previous agreements, all excess personal property located in foreign areas shall be disposed of by the owning agency, and directs that the head of the agency conform to the foreign policy of the United States in making such disposals in accordance 41 CFR 102&#x2013;36.

####### § 109-45.5102 General.

Disposal of Government-owned personal property in the custody of DOE organizations or its contractors in foreign areas shall be made in an efficient and economical manner, and in conformance with the foreign policy of the United States.

####### § 109-45.5103 Definitions.

As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:

means outside the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin Islands.

means the local diplomatic or consular post in the area where the excess personal property is located.

####### § 109-45.5104 Disposal.

####### § 109-45.5104-1 General.

Foreign excess personal property which is not required for transfer within DOE or to other U.S. Government agencies, except for the personal property identified in § 109&#x2013;45.5005&#x2013;1(a) of this part, shall be considered surplus and may be disposed of by transfer, sale, exchange, or lease, for cash, credit, or other property and upon such other terms and conditions as may be deemed proper. Such personal property may also be donated, abandoned, or destroyed under the conditions specified in § 109&#x2013;45.5105&#x2013;2 of this subpart. Most foreign governments have indicated to the U.S. State Department that they wish to be consulted before U.S. Government property is disposed of in their countries (except in the case of transfers to other U.S. Government agencies). Matters concerning customs duties and taxes, or similar charges, may require prior agreement with the foreign government involved. The State Department shall be contacted in regard to these issues. Whenever advice or approval of the State Department is required by this subpart, it may be obtained either through the foreign service post in the foreign area involved or from the State Department in Washington, DC. If the issue is to be presented to the State Department in Washington, DC, it shall be referred through appropriate administrative channels to the Office of International Affairs for review, coordination, and handling.

####### § 109-45.5104-2 Methods of disposal.

(a) Sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted in accordance with the following guidelines:

(1) Generally, all sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous to the U.S. Government.

(2) In no event shall any personal property be sold in foreign areas without a condition which states that its importation into the United States is forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (in the case of any agricultural commodity, food, cotton, or woolen goods), or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other property), has determined that the importation of such property would relieve domestic shortages or otherwise be beneficial to the economy of the United States.

(3) Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any import duties or taxes levied against personal property sold in the country involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax shall not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government for the personal property. In the event the levy is placed upon the seller by law, the buyer will be required to pay all such duties or taxes and furnish the seller copies of his receipts prior to the release of the personal property to him. However, if the foreign government involved will not accept payment from the buyer, the seller will collect the duties or taxes and turn the amounts collected over to the foreign government. Accounting for the amounts collected shall be coordinated with the disbursing officer of the nearest United States foreign service post. The property shall not be released to the purchaser until the disposal officer is satisfied that there is no responsibility for payment by the United States (as contrasted to collection by the United States) of taxes, duties, excises, etc.

(4) Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department for the sale of certain categories of personal property, including small arms and machine guns; artillery and projectiles; ammunition, bombs, torpedoes, rockets and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range finders; tanks and ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents, propellants and explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment; aircraft and all components, parts and accessories for aircraft; military electronic equipment; aerial cameras, military photo-interpretation, stereoscopic plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and all material not enumerated which is included in the United States Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01, and is subject to disposal restrictions. Therefore, prior to the sale of any of the articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign service post in the area shall be consulted.

(5) All proposed sales, regardless of the total acquisition cost of personal property involved, which the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a significant economic or political impact in a particular area, shall be discussed with the foreign service post.

(b) While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign surplus personal property, such authority shall be exercised only when such action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government. Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals by sale under § 109&#x2013;45.5105&#x2013;2 of this subpart.

(c)(1) Foreign excess or surplus personal property (including salvage and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided:

(i) The property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; and

(ii) A written finding to that effect is made and approved by the Office of International Affairs.

(2) No personal property shall be abandoned or destroyed if donation is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to any agency of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health, or charitable nonprofit organizations.

(3) Foreign excess personal property may also be abandoned or destroyed when such action is required by military necessity, safety, or considerations of health or security. A written statement explaining the basis for disposal by these means and approval by the Office of International Affairs.

(4) Property shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which is detrimental or dangerous to public health and safety, or which will cause infringement on the rights of other persons.

####### § 109-45.5105 Reports.

(a) Proposed sales of foreign surplus personal property shall include all pertinent data, including the following:

(1) The description of personal property to be sold, including:

(i) Identification of personal property (description should be in terms understandable to persons not expert in technical nomenclature). Personal property covered by the U.S. Munitions List and regulations pertaining thereto (as published in 22 CFR 121.1) should be clearly identified;

(ii) Quantity;

(iii) Condition; and

(iv) Acquisition cost.

(2) The proposed method of sale (sealed bid, negotiated sale, etc.)

###### § 128-1.5002-4 Bureau.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Prisons; the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated; and the Operations Support Staff (OSS) of the Office of Management and Finance. The OSS has authority and is responsible for all personal property management functions for the Offices, Boards, and Divisions of the Department, the United States Marshals Service, and the United States Parole Commission.

###### § 128-1.5002-5 Personal property.

Property of any kind or interest therein, except real and related property (as defined in FPMR 41 CFR 101&#x2013;43.104&#x2013;15), records of the Federal Government, and naval vessels, cruisers, aircraft-carriers, destroyers, and submarines (FPMR 41 CFR 101&#x2013;43.104&#x2013;13). For management and accounting control, personal property is categorized as follows:

(a) “Expendable personal property” is that which, by its nature or function, is consumed in use; is used as repair parts or components of an end product considered nonexpendable; or has an expected service life of less than one year.

(b) “Non-expendable personal property” is that which is complete within itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put into use, and is of a durable nature with an expected service life one or more years.

(c) “Controlled personal property” is that personal property for which good management practice dictates that it would be in the interest of the Government to assign and record accountability to assure the proper use, maintenance, protection and disposal of property for which the Government is responsible. Includes, but is not restricted to property which:

(1) Is leased by, in the custody of, or is loaned to or from the Department.

(2) Due to inherent attractiveness and/or portability is subject to a high probability of theft or misuse.

(3) Is warranted, requires knowledge of age and/or previous repair data when determining whether repair or replacement is appropriate.

###### § 128-1.5002-6 Personal property management.

(1) The establishment of Department-wide policies, directions, regulations, and procedures satisfying the requirements of law, regulations, and sound management practice; and

(2) The review, evaluation, and improvement of personal property management programs, functions, operations, and procedures throughout the Department.

(b) Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.75 and subject to the general supervision of the Attorney General and the direction of the Deputy Attorney General, the functions described above are assigned to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration as delegations of authority.

###### § 128-1.5004 Basis for delegations of authority and assignment of responsibilities.

Certain personal property management functions can be performed by an individual only under a specific grant of authority to that individual. Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions listed in § 128&#x2013;1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

###### § 128-1.5005 Delegations of authority.

###### § 128-1.5005-1 Primary delegations.

The following authorities are redelegated to the heads of bureaus for use within their respective jurisdictions and shall be exercised in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

(a) Designating the PMO, for the bureau, within the following limitations:

(1) Only one PMO is to be designated for the bureau, at the bureau level. Neither the title designation nor the responsibilities of the PMO are to be delegated below that level.

(2) One or more PC's also may be designated for the bureau, depending upon the size and complexity of the organizational structure. Each PC is responsible solely for that property within his respective jurisdiction. The number and distribution of PC's designated is entirely at the option of the head of the bureau.

(3) There is no restriction on designating a single individual as PMO and PC providing that the functions and responsibilities are compatible and are within the capabilities of a single person.

(b) Authorizing exceptions to the FPMR use and replacement standards for office machines, furniture, furnishings and typewriters specified in §§ 101&#x2013;25.3 and 101&#x2013;25.4.

## Subtitle E [Reserved]

## Subtitle F - Federal Travel Regulation System

### Chapter 300 - General

#### Subchapter A - Introduction

##### PART 300-1 - THE FEDERAL TRAVEL REGULATION (FTR)

###### § 300-1.1 What is the FTR?

The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapters 300 through 304, which implements statutory requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by Federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at Government expense.

###### § 300-1.2 What is the purpose of the FTR?

There are two principal purposes:

(a) To interpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner that balances the need to assure that official travel is conducted in a responsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs;

(b) To communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to Federal agencies and employees.

##### PART 300-2 - HOW TO USE THE FTR

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 300-2.1 What formats exist in the FTR?

The FTR is written in two formats&#x2014;the question & answer format and the title and narrative format.

###### Subpart B - Question & Answer Format

####### § 300-2.20 What is the purpose of the question & answer format?

The Q&A format is an effective way to engage the reader and to break the information into manageable pieces.

####### § 300-2.21 How is the rule expressed in the question and answer format?

The rule is expressed in both the question and answer.

####### § 300-2.22 Who is subject to the FTR?

Since the user may be an employee or an agency, portions of the FTR have been separated into employee and agency sections. However, while the employee provisions are addressed to the employee, the rules expressed in those provisions apply to the agency as well. The following lists the relevant employee and agency sections of the FTR:

####### § 300-2.23 How is the user addressed in the FTR?

The FTR asks questions in the first person, as the user would. It then answers the questions in the second and third person. In the employee sections, the employee is addressed in the singular, and in the agency sections, the agency is addressed in the plural. The following describes how employee and agency are addressed in both sections:

###### Subpart C - Title and Narrative Format

####### § 300-2.70 How is the rule expressed in the title and narrative format?

The rule is in the narrative. The title serves only as a tool to determine the subject of the rule.

##### PART 300-3 - GLOSSARY OF TERMS

###### § 300-3.1 What do the following terms mean?

&#x2014;Government property and personal property of the traveler necessary for official travel.

&#x2014;Payment of authorized actual expenses incurred, up to the limit prescribed by the Administrator of GSA or agency, as appropriate. Entitlement to reimbursement is contingent upon entitlement to per diem, and is subject to the same definitions and rules governing per diem.

&#x2014;For purposes of chapter 302means:

(1) An executive agency as defined in Title 5 U.S.C. 105 (an executive department, an independent establishment, the Government Accountability Office, or a wholly owned Government corporation as defined in section 101 of the Government Corporation Control Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. 9101), but excluding a Government controlled corporation);

(2) A military department;

(3) A court of the United States;

(4) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts;

(5) The Federal Judicial Center;

(6) The Library of Congress;

(7) The United States Botanic Garden;

(9) The District of Columbia.

&#x2014;An agency component that has management control of Federal aircraft used by the agency or of aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS).

&#x2014;Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee receives a bona fide offer from a qualified buyer before the employee has accepted an appraised value offer from the relocation services company (RSC). The RSC amends its offer to match the outside sale price. An amended value sale is different from an amended from zero sale because an amended value sale occurs after an appraised value offer while an amended from zero sale occurs before an appraised value offer.

&#x2014;Type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating employee accepts the offer from the RSC to buy the employee's home based upon the average of a specific number of appraisals conducted by designated certified appraisers.

&#x2014;Any place of public lodging that is listed on the national master list of approved accommodations.

Additionally, the approved accommodation list is available on the U.S. Fire Administration's internet site at.

&#x2014;Government contractor-provided ATM services that allow cash withdrawals from participating ATMs to be charged to a Government contractor-issued charge card.

&#x2014;Type of home sale program with procedures the same as the amended value program, except that the RSC does not initially appraise the employee's home or make a guaranteed buy-out offer. The buy-out offer from the contractor is based on a bona fide offer received by the employee from a qualified buyer after marketing by the employee. Once a bona fide offer is received by the employee, the contractor offers to buy the home from the employee at a price based on the outside sale price.

&#x2014;The class of accommodation that is normally the lowest class of fare offered by common carriers regardless of terminology used. For reference purposes only, coach class may also be referred to as tourist class, economy class, steerage, or standard class.

&#x2014;Under commercial air transportation seating upgrade programs, a passenger may obtain a preferable seat choice or increased amenities or services within the coach class seating area. These upgraded choices are generally available for a fee, as a program membership benefit (such as frequent flyer) or at an airport kiosk or gate. Coach class seating upgrade options are not considered a new or higher class of accommodation from coach as the seat is lower than other than coach class accommodations in terms of cost and amenities (seating girth and pitch, priority boarding, luggage allowance, expedited food/drink service).

&#x2014;Commercial aviation services (CAS) include, for the exclusive use of an executive agency&#x2014;

(1) Leased aircraft;

(2) Chartered or rented aircraft;

Fares may be issued using one of the following fare types, or others that the contract City Pair Program may solicit:

(1)(_CA)&#x2014;A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is less expensive than the unrestricted contract City Pair Program coach class fare (YCA), but has limited inventory availability, meaning, once the flight reaches a certain capacity, _CA fares may no longer be available for booking. Unlike YCA fares, _CA fares are restricted by the availability of seats. Accordingly, early booking may increase the likelihood of booking a _CA fare. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.

(2)(YCA)&#x2014;A contract City Pair Program coach class fare that is more expensive than a _CA fare, but offers last seat (inventory) availability (unless a flight is already sold out), meaning, as long as coach class inventory is available to sell on the flight, the Government traveler can purchase it.

(3)(_CB)&#x2014;Contract fare offered by carriers in some domestic and international line item markets for business class service. The first character of the three-character fare basis code varies by airline.

&#x2014;A person assigned to operate or assist in operating an aircraft.

(8) Are willing to certify, if required by the agency, that they understand that willful falsification of any documentation required to establish that an individual is in a domestic partnership may lead to disciplinary action and the recovery of the cost of benefits received related to such falsification, as well as constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and that the method for securing such certification, if required, shall be determined by the agency;

(9) Are willing promptly to disclose, if required by the agency, any dissolution or material change in the status of the domestic partnership; and

Such lodging includes college dormitories or similar facilities or rooms not offered commercially but made available to the public by area residents in their homes.

(5)You may be reimbursed for expenses (parking fees, fees for connection, use, and disconnection of utilities, electricity, gas, water and sewage, bath or shower fees, and dumping fees) which may be considered as a lodging cost.

####### § 301-11.14 How is my daily lodging rate computed when I rent lodging on a long-term basis?

When you obtain lodging on a long-term basis (e.g., weekly or monthly) your daily lodging rate is computed by dividing the total lodging cost by the number of days of occupancy for which you are entitled to per diem, provided the cost does not exceed the daily rate of conventional lodging.

Reimbursement, including an appropriate amount for M&IE, may not exceed the maximum daily per diem rate for the TDY location.

####### § 301-11.15 What expenses may be considered part of the daily lodging cost when I rent on a long-term basis?

When you rent a room, apartment, house, or other lodging on a long-term basis (e.g., weekly, monthly), the following expenses may be considered part of the lodging cost:

(a) The rental cost for a furnished dwelling; if unfurnished, the rental cost of the dwelling and the rental cost of appropriate and necessary furniture and appliances (e.g., stove, refrigerator, chairs, tables, bed, sofa, television, or vacuum cleaner);

No. A meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal provided by a hotel/motel does not affect your per diem.

####### § 301-11.18 What M&IE rate will I receive if a meal(s) is furnished by the Government or is included in the registration fee?

(a) Except as provided in § 301&#x2013;11.17 or in paragraph (b) of this section, your M&IE allowance must be adjusted for meals furnished to you by the Government (including meals furnished under the authority of chapter 304 of this title) by deducting the appropriate amount shown at. For meals provided on the day of departure and the last day of travel, you must deduct the entire allocated meal cost from the decreased M&IE rate (see § 301&#x2013;11.101). The total amount of deductions made will not cause you to receive less than the amount allowed for incidental expenses.

####### § 301-11.21 Will I be reimbursed for per diem or actual expenses on leave or non-workdays (weekend, legal Federal Government holiday, or other scheduled non-workdays) while I am on official travel?

(a) In general, you will be reimbursed as long as your travel status requires your stay to include a non-workday, (e.g., if you are on travel through Friday and again starting Monday you will be reimbursed for Saturday and Sunday), however, your agency should determine the most cost effective situation (remaining in a travel status and paying per diem or actual expenses or permitting your return to your official station).

(b) Your agency will determine whether you will be reimbursed for non-workdays when you take leave immediately (e.g., Friday or Monday) before or after the non-workday(s).

(c) Periodic return travel home is justified incident to an extended TDY assignment.

####### § 301-11.24 What reimbursement will I receive if I voluntarily return home or to my official station on non-workdays during my TDY assignment?

Yes. You must provide a lodging receipt and a receipt for every authorized expense over $75, or provide a reason acceptable to your agency explaining why you are unable to furnish the necessary receipt(s) (see § 301&#x2013;52.4 of this chapter).

####### § 301-11.26 How do I request a review of the per diem in a location?

If you travel to a location where the per diem rate is insufficient to meet necessary expenses, you may submit a request, containing pertinent lodging & meal cost data, through your agency's Travel Manager asking that the location be reviewed. Depending on the location in question your agency's Travel Manager may submit the review request to:

####### § 301-11.27 Are taxes included in the lodging portion of the Government per diem rate?

###### § 301-52.22 Will any late payment fees I receive be reported as wages on a Form W-2?

No, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined that the late payment fee is in the nature of interest (compensation for the use of money). Your agency will report payments in accordance with IRS guidelines.

###### § 301-52.23 Is the additional fee, which is equal to any late payment charge that the card contractor would have been able to charge had I not paid the bill, considered income?

Yes, your agency will report this payment as additional wages on Form W-2.

###### § 301-52.24 Does mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge card change my obligation to pay my travel card bill by the due date?

No, mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge card does not relieve you of your obligation to pay your bill in accordance with your cardholder agreement.

##### PART 301-53 - USING PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND FREQUENT TRAVELER PROGRAMS

###### § 301-53.1 To whom do the pronouns “I”, “you”, and their variants refer throughout this part?

The pronouns “I”, “you”, and their variants throughout this part refer to the employee.

###### § 301-53.2 What may I do with promotional benefits or materials I receive from a travel service provider?

Any promotional benefits or materials received from a travel service provider in connection with official travel may be retained for personal use, if such items are obtained under the same conditions as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the Government.

###### § 301-53.3 How may I use promotional materials and frequent traveler benefits?

Promotional materials and frequent traveler benefits may be used as follows:

(a) You may use frequent traveler benefits earned on official travel to obtain travel services for a subsequent official travel assignment(s); however, you may also retain such benefits for your personal use, including upgrading to a higher class of service while on official travel.

(b) If you are offered such benefits as a result of your role as a conference planner or as a planner for other group travel, you may not retain such benefits for your personal use (§ 301&#x2013;53.2 of this chapter). Rather, you may only accept such benefits on behalf of the Federal Government. Such accepted benefits may only be used for official Government business.

###### § 301-53.4 May I select travel service providers for which my agency is not a mandatory user in order to maximize my frequent traveler benefits?

No, you may not select a traveler service provider based on whether it provides frequent traveler benefits. You must use the travel service provider for which your agency is a mandatory user. This includes contract passenger transportation services and travel management services. You may not choose a travel service provider to gain frequent traveler benefits for personal use. (Also see §§ 301&#x2013;10.113 and 301&#x2013;10.114 of this chapter.)

###### § 301-53.5 Are there exceptions to the mandatory use of contract City Pair Program fares and an agency's travel management service?

Yes, the exceptions are in accordance with §§ 301&#x2013;10.111 and 301&#x2013;10.112 of this chapter for the mandatory use of a contract City Pair Program fare, and § 301&#x2013;73.103 of this chapter for the mandatory use of a travel management service.

###### § 301-53.6 Is a denied boarding benefit considered a promotional item for which I may retain compensation received from an airline whether voluntary or involuntary?

A denied boarding benefit (e.g., cash, free ticket coupon) is not a promotional item given by an airline. See the provisions of § 301&#x2013;10.122 of this chapter when an airline denies you a seat (involuntary) and § 301&#x2013;10.123 of this chapter when you vacate your seat (voluntary).

###### Subpart A - General Rules

####### § 301-54.1 Is my agency allowed to collect undisputed delinquent amounts that I owe to a Government travel charge card contractor?

Yes, upon written request from the contractor, your agency may collect, from your disposable pay, any undisputed delinquent amounts that you owe to a Government travel charge card contractor.

####### § 301-54.2 What is disposable pay?

Disposable pay is your compensation remaining after the deduction from your earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld. These deductions do not include discretionary deductions such as savings bonds, charitable contributions, etc. Deductions may be made from any type of pay you receive from your agency, e.g., basic pay, special pay, retirement pay, or incentive pay.

###### Subpart B - Policies and Procedures

####### § 301-54.100 Are there any due process requirements with which my agency must comply before collecting undisputed delinquent amounts on behalf of the charge card contractor?

Yes, your agency must:

(a) Provide you with written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention to collect the claim by deduction from your disposable pay, and an explanation of your rights as a debtor;

(b) Give you the opportunity to inspect and copy their records related to the claim;

(c) Allow an opportunity for a review within the agency of its decision to collect the amount; and

(d) Provide you with an opportunity to make a written agreement with the contractor to repay the delinquent amount of the claim.

####### § 301-54.101 Can my agency initiate collection of undisputed delinquent amounts if it has not reimbursed me for amounts reimbursable under the applicable travel regulations?

No, your agency may only collect undisputed delinquent amounts for which you have been reimbursed under the applicable travel regulations. However, if you have not submitted a proper travel claim within the timeframe requirements of § 301&#x2013;52.7 of this chapter, and there are no extenuating circumstances, your agency may collect the undisputed delinquent amounts based on the amounts charged on the travel charge card.

####### § 301-54.102 What is the maximum amount my agency may deduct from my disposable pay?

As set forth in Public Law 105&#x2013;264, 112 Stat. 2350, October 19, 1998, the maximum amount your agency may deduct from your disposable pay is 15 percent a pay period, unless you agree in writing to a larger percentage.

#### Subchapter D - Agency Responsibilities

##### PART 301-70 - INTERNAL POLICY AND PROCEDURE REQUIREMENTS

###### Subpart A - General Policies and Procedures

####### § 301-70.1 How must we administer the authorization and payment of travel expenses?

When administering the authorization and payment of travel expenses, you&#x2014;

(a) Must limit the authorization and payment of travel expenses to travel that is necessary to accomplish your mission in the most economical and effective manner, under rules stated throughout this chapter;

(b) Should give consideration to budget constraints, adherence to travel policies, and reasonableness of expenses;

(c) Should always consider alternatives, including teleconferencing, prior to authorizing travel; and

(d) Must require employees to use the ETS to process travel authorizations and claims for travel expenses once you migrate to the ETS, but no later than September 30, 2006, unless an exception has been granted under § 301&#x2013;73.102 or § 301&#x2013;73.104 of this chapter.

###### Subpart B - Policies and Procedures Relating to Transportation

####### § 301-70.100 How must we administer the authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

You must:

(a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government;

(b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.

####### § 301-70.101 What factors must we consider in determining which method of transportation results in the greatest advantage to the Government?

In selecting a particular method of transportation you must consider:

(a) The total cost to the Government, including per diem, overtime, lost worktime, actual transportation cost, total distance of travel, number of points visited, the number of travelers and energy conservation. As stated in 5 U.S.C. 5733, “travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.”

(b) Travel by common carrier (air, rail, bus) is considered the most advantageous method to perform official travel. Other methods of transportation may be authorized as advantageous only when the use of common carrier transportation would interfere with the performance of official business or impose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when the total cost by common carrier exceeds the cost by another method of transportation. A determination that another method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government than common carrier will not be made on the basis of personal preference or inconvenience to the traveler.

(c) When travel must be performed by automobile, agencies should next consider using a Government-furnished automobile.

(d) If a Government-furnished automobile is not available, agencies should then consider using the least expensive compact rental vehicle.

(e) Agencies should lastly consider authorizing a POV only if the employee agrees to use a POV, because agencies cannot mandate employees to use their POV for official reasons.

####### § 301-70.102 What governing policies must we establish for authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government;

(b) Who will approve any of the following:

(1) Use of other than coach class accommodations under § 301&#x2013;10.103 of this chapter;

(2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;

(3) Use of an extra-fare train service under § 301&#x2013;10.160;

(4) Use of ship service;

(5) Use of a foreign ship;

(6) Use of a foreign air carrier;

(c) When you will:

(1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;

(2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and

(3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;

(d) When you consider the use of a POV advantageous to the Government, such as travel to and from common carrier terminals or to the TDY location. When determining whether the use of a POV to a TDY location is the most advantageous method of transportation, you must consider the total cost of using a POV as compared to the total cost of using a rental vehicle, including rental costs, fuel, taxes, parking (at a common carrier terminal&#x2014;not to exceed the cost of taxi or transportation network company fare, etc.), and any other relevant costs;

(e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;

(f) Procedures for allowing the use of a special conveyance (e.g., taxis, TNCs, innovative mobility technology companies, or commercially rented vehicles), taking into account the requirements of § 301&#x2013;10.450;

(g) What procedures an employee must follow when he/she travels by an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route;

(h) Whether to reimburse the full amount of transportation costs and in conjunction with TDY or only the amount by which transportation costs exceed the employee's normal costs for transportation between:

(1) Office or duty point and another place of business;

(2) Places of business; or

(3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point;

(i) Develop and issue internal guidance on what specific mission criteria justify use of other than coach class under § 301&#x2013;10.103(a)(9) and the use of other than the least expensive compact car available under § 301&#x2013;10.450(c). The justification criteria shall be noted on the traveler's authorization.

(j) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding what constitutes a rest period upon arrival at a temporary duty location; and

(k) Develop and publish internal guidance regarding when coach class seating upgrade fees will be authorized as advantageous to the Government and reimbursed (see § 301&#x2013;10.121).

####### § 301-70.103 In what circumstance may we authorize use of ship service?

Travel by ship is not generally regarded as advantageous. You must determine that the advantages accruing from the use of ocean transportation offset the higher costs associated with ship travel,per diem, transportation, and lost worktime.

####### § 301-70.104 What factors should we consider in determining whether to require an employee to commit to the use of a Government-furnished automobile?

You should consider:

(a) The advantages of using a Government-furnished automobile . Such advantages may include, but are not limited to:

(1) Full utilization or availability of fleet vehicles;

(2) Lower cost;

(3) Official presence.

(b) The type of travel the employee performs. You should require such a commitment when an employee or group of employees requires the use of an automobile for official travel on a frequent or repetitive basis.

####### § 301-70.105 May we prohibit an employee from using a POV on official travel?

No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:

(a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized method of transportation, which is the sum of travel and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred had the employee traveled by the method of transportation deemed to be most advantageous to the Government. The calculation will necessarily involve assumptions. Examples of related expenses that could be considered constructive costs include, but are not limited to, taxi and TNC fares, baggage fees, rental car costs, tolls, ferry fees, and parking charges; and

(b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of travel by POV.

###### Subpart C - Policies and Procedures Relating to Per Diem Expenses

####### § 301-70.200 What governing policies must we establish for authorization and payment of per diem expenses?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will authorize a rest period;

(b) Circumstances allowing a rest period during prolonged travel (see § 301&#x2013;11.20 for minimum standards);

(c) If, and in what instances, you will allow an employee to return to his/her official station on non-workdays;

(d) Who will determine if an employee will be allowed to return to his/her official station on a case by case basis.

(e) Who will determine in what instances you will pay a reduced per diem rate;

(f) Who will determine, and in what instances, to issue a blanket authorization for actual expenses under § 301&#x2013;70.201 or when actual expenses are appropriate in individual cases; and

(g) Who will determine, and in what instances, an employee will be able to claim the full M&IE allowance even though meals are furnished to the employee by the Government, in accordance with §§ 301&#x2013;11.18(b) and 301&#x2013;11.18(c).

####### § 301-70.201 May we issue a blanket actual expense authorization for our employees during a Presidentially-Declared Disaster?

Yes. A blanket authorization regarding actual expense reimbursement may be issued to your employees assigned to perform TDY travel in an area subject to a Presidentially-Declared Disaster. These authorizations must apply to a specific Declaration, and must end on the expiration date of the Declaration, or one year from the date the Declaration is issued, whichever is sooner. A blanket authorization issued under this section shall not apply to any travel performed pursuant to chapter 302 of this title.

###### Subpart D - Policies and Procedures Relating to Miscellaneous Expenses

####### § 301-70.300 How should we administer the authorization and payment of miscellaneous expenses?

You should limit payment of miscellaneous expenses to only those expenses that are necessary and in the interest of the Government.

####### § 301-70.301 What governing policies must we establish for payment of miscellaneous expenses?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will determine when excess baggage is necessary for official travel;

(b) When you will pay for communications services, including whether you will pay for a telephone call to the employee's home or place where the employee's dependent children are;

(c) Who will determine if other miscellaneous expenses are appropriate for reimbursement in connection with official travel, including but not limited to, fees for the use of automated teller machine (ATMs) when using the Government contractor-issued travel charge card and expenses for laundry, cleaning, and pressing of clothing.

###### Subpart E - Policies and Procedures Relating to Travel of an Employee with a Disability or Special Need

####### § 301-70.400 How should we authorize and administer the payment of additional travel expenses for an employee with a disability or special need?

You should authorize and administer the payment to reasonably accommodate employee(s) with disabilities in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 701,) and 5 U.S.C. 3102 and part 301&#x2013;13 of this chapter. An employee with a special need should be treated the same as an employee with a disability. You must determine that additional travel expenses are necessary to accommodate the employee's needs.

####### § 301-70.401 What governing policies and procedures must we establish regarding travel of an employee with a disability or special need?

You must establish the policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will determine if an employee has a disability or special need which requires accommodation, including when documentation is necessary under §§ 301&#x2013;10.103 and 301&#x2013;10.121, and when a determination may be based on a clearly visible and discernible physical condition; and

(b) Who will determine how to reasonably accommodate the employee and what expenses you will pay.

###### Subpart F - Policies and Procedures for Emergency Travel of Employee Due to Illness or Injury

####### § 301-70.500 What governing policies and procedures should we establish relating to emergency travel?

Each agency must determine:

(a) When you will authorize emergency travel under part 301&#x2013;30;

(b) Who will determine if the employee's situation warrants payment for emergency travel expenses;

(c) When and by whom travel to an alternate location other than official station or point of interruption will be authorized; and

(d) Who will determine when and if the definition of family may be extended and to whom.

####### § 301-70.501 Does per diem continue when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury?

Yes, when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave (annual or sick), per diem will be allowed, not to exceed the maximum rate for the location where the interruption occurs, for a reasonable period, normally not to exceed 14 calendar days (including fractional days) for any one period of absence. You may approve a longer period if justified.

####### § 301-70.502 Are there any limitations to the payment of these expenses?

Yes, there are limitations to the payment of these expenses. Per diem is not payable, or if paid, must be collected from the employee when&#x2014;

(a) The employee is confined to a hospital or medical facility that is within the proximity of the official station or that is the same one the employee would have been admitted to if the illness or injury had occurred while at the official station; and/or

(b) The Government provides or reimburses the employee for hospitalization under any Federal statute (including hospitalization in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center or military hospital) other than 5 U.S.C. 8901&#x2013;8913 (Federal Employees Health Benefits program).

####### § 301-70.503 What additional emergency expenses should we allow?

When an employee discontinues a TDY assignment before its completion due to an incapacitating illness or injury, you may pay&#x2014;

(a) Transportation and per diem expenses for travel to an alternate location to receive medical treatment;

(b) Transportation and per diem expenses to return to the official station; and

(c) Transportation costs of a medically necessary attendant.

####### § 301-70.504 When the employee is able to travel, should we continue the use of the existing travel authorization?

Not if the interrupted trip was authorized under a trip by trip authorization. If, when the employee's health has been restored, the agency decides that it is in the Government's interest to return the employee to the TDY location, such return is considered to be a new travel assignment at Government expense. An interrupted trip authorized under an open or limited open authorization may be continued without further authorization.

####### § 301-70.505 May any travel costs be reimbursed if the employee travels to an alternate location for medical treatment?

Yes. When an employee interrupts a TDY assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave of absence for travel to an alternate location to obtain medical services and returns to the TDY assignment, you may reimburse certain excess travel costs provided in this section. Specifically, you may reimburse the excess (if any) of actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to the alternate location and return to the TDY assignment, over the constructive costs of round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate location. The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating the employee's illness or injury will not, however, be considered an alternate location.

####### § 301-70.506 How do we define actual cost and constructive cost when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury?

(a) Actual cost of travel will be the transportation expenses incurred and en route per diem for the travel as actually performed from the point of interruption to the alternate location and from the alternate location to the TDY assignment. No per diem is allowed for time spent at the alternate location if confined to a medical facility.

(b) Constructive cost is the sum of travel and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred for round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate location plus per diem calculated for the appropriate en route travel time. The calculation will necessarily involve assumptions. Examples of related expenses that could be considered constructive costs include, but are not limited to, taxi and TNC fares, baggage fees, rental car costs, tolls, ferry fees, and parking charges.

####### § 301-70.507 May we authorize per diem if an employee discontinues a TDY assignment because of a personal emergency situation?

Yes. Expenses of appropriate transportation and per diem while en route may be allowed, with the approval of an appropriate agency official, for return travel from the point of interruption to the official station.

####### § 301-70.508 How do we handle reimbursement if the employee travels to an alternate location and returns to the TDY location because of a personal emergency situation?

You may reimburse certain excess travel costs (transportation and en route per diem) to the same extent as provided in § 301&#x2013;70.501 for incapacitating illness or injury to the employee.

####### § 301-70.509 What factors must we consider in expanding the definition of family for emergency travel purposes?

Agencies must consider on a case by case basis:

(b) The employee's relationship to the individual involved in the emergency; and

(c) The degree of the employee's responsibility for the individual involved in the emergency.

###### Subpart G - Policies and Procedures Relating to Threatened Law Enforcement/Investigative Employees

####### § 301-70.600 What governing policies and procedures must we establish related to threatened law enforcement/investigative employees?

(b) Who will determine the degree and seriousness of threat in each individual case;

(c) Who will determine what protective action should be taken, including the location and duration of temporary lodging;

(d) Who will reevaluate the situation to determine whether protective action should be continued or discontinued and how often;

(e) What procedures must be followed to obtain authorization of transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened law enforcement/investigative employees; and

(f) What special procedures must an employee follow to claim expenses.

####### § 301-70.601 What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize payment of transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened law enforcement/investigative employees?

You should consider:

(a)You should pay transportation and subsistence expenses only if a situation poses a legitimate serious threat to life.

(b)You should consider whether relocating the employee permanently would be advantageous given the specific nature of the threat, the continued disruption of the family, and the alternative costs of a change of official station.

####### § 301-70.602 How often must we reevaluate the payment of transportation and subsistence expenses to a threatened law enforcement/investigative employee?

You must reevaluate the situation every 30 days based on the same factors you considered when you first authorized the payment of the expenses.

###### Subpart H - Policies and Procedures Relating to Mandatory Use of the Government Contractor-Issued Travel Charge Card for Official Travel

####### § 301-70.700 Must our employees use a Government contractor-issued travel charge card for official travel expenses?

(1) It is in the best interest of the United States to do so;

(2) Payment through a travel charge card is impractical or imposes unreasonable burdens or costs on Federal employees or Federal agencies; or

(3) The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security (for the Coast Guard) requests an exemption for the members of their uniformed services.

(b) The head of a Federal agency or his/her designee(s) may exempt any payment, person, type or class of payments, or type or class of agency personnel if the exemption is determined to be necessary in the interest of the agency.

####### § 301-70.702 Must we notify the Administrator of General Services when we grant an exemption?

Yes, you must notify the Administrator of General Services, Office of Government-wide Policy, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405, in writing within 30 days after granting the exemption, stating the reasons for the exemption.

####### § 301-70.703 If we grant an exemption, does that prevent the employee from using the card on a voluntary basis?

No, an exemption from use would not prevent the employee from using the Government contractor-issued travel charge card for official travel expenses on a voluntary basis in accordance with your policies.

####### § 301-70.704 What classes of employees are exempt from mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge card?

The Administrator of General Services exempts the following classes of employees from mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge card:

####### § 301-70.707 May an employee use the Government contractor-issued travel charge card for personal use while on official travel?

No, an employee may not use the Government contractor-issued travel charge card for personal use while on official travel.

####### § 301-70.708 What actions may we take if an employee fails to activate the Government contractor-issued travel charge card and/or misuses the travel charge card?

Internal agency policies and procedures should be established defining what are considered to be misuses of the Government contractor-issued travel charge card. Appropriate action may be taken pursuant to those policies if an employee fails to activate the Government contractor-issued travel charge card within 60 days of receipt or misuses the travel charge card.

####### § 301-70.709 What can we do to reduce travel charge card delinquencies?

To reduce travel charge card delinquencies by your employees, you should consider implementing one or more of the following suggestions (this list is not comprehensive; you may adopt other appropriate procedures):

(a) Agency travel program coordinators must be trained and aware of their responsibilities and the delinquency management tools available under your agreement with the travel charge card contractor.

(b) Ensure that managers and supervisors are provided monthly delinquency and questionable charges report.

(c) Periodically, but at least once a year, verify that cardholders are still current employees.

(d) For inactive accounts (cards not used within 6 months, one year, etc., reduce card limit to $1, increase dollar limit when necessary.

(f) Review ATM cash withdrawals for reasonableness and association with official travel.

(g) Implement a salary offset program. (See part 301&#x2013;76 of this chapter).

(h) Implement split disbursement in your travel vouchering system, so that an employee may authorize you to make certain payments directly to the charge card contractor on the employee's behalf.

(i) Refer potential fraud cases to your agency IG for investigation.

(j) Information on travel cardholder training is available at

(k) Ensure that employees turn in their travel charge card when they retire or leave the agency.

###### Subpart I - Policies and Procedures for Agencies That Authorize Travel on Government Aircraft

####### § 301-70.800 Whom may we authorize to travel on Government aircraft?

You may authorize Federal travelers, non-Federal travelers, and any other passengers, as defined in part 300&#x2013;3 of this subtitle, to travel on Government aircraft, subject to the rules in this subpart. Because the taxpayers generally should pay no more than necessary for transportation of travelers, except for required use travel, you may authorize travel on Government aircraft only when a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective mode of travel and the traveler is traveling for Governmental purposes.

####### § 301-70.801 When may we authorize travel on Government aircraft?

You may authorize travel on Government aircraft only as follows:

(a) For official travel when&#x2014;

(1) No scheduled commercial airline service is reasonably available to fulfill your agency's travel requirement (able to meet the traveler's departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24&#x2013;hour period, unless you demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances require a shorter period); or

(2) The cost of using a Government aircraft is not more than the cost of the city-pair fare for scheduled commercial airline service or the cost of the lowest available full coach fare if a city-pair fare is not available to the traveler.

(b) For required-use travel,when the traveler is authorized to use Government aircraft because of bona fide communications needs (e.g., 24&#x2013;hour secure communications are required) or security reasons (e.g., highly unusual circumstances that present a clear and present danger to the traveler) or exceptional scheduling requirements (e.g., a national emergency or other compelling operational considerations). Required-use travel may include travel for official, personal, or political purposes, but must be approved in accordance with §§ 301&#x2013;10.262(a) and 301&#x2013;70.803(a).

(c) For space available travel when&#x2014;

(1) The aircraft is already scheduled for use for an official purpose and carrying an official traveler(s) on the aircraft does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government; or

(2) The Federal traveler or the dependent of a Federal traveler is stationed by the Government in a remote location not accessible to commercial airline service; or

####### § 301-70.802 Must we ensure that travel on Government aircraft is the most cost-effective alternative?

(a) Yes, you must ensure that travel on a Government aircraft is the most cost-effective alternative that will meet the travel requirement. Your designated travel approving official must&#x2014;

(1) Compare the cost of all travel alternatives, as applicable, that is&#x2014;

(i) Travel on a scheduled commercial airline;

(ii) Travel on a Federal aircraft;

(iii) Travel on a Government aircraft hired as a commercial aviation service (CAS); and

(iv) Travel by other available modes of transportation; and

(2) Approve only the most cost-effective alternative that meets your agency's needs.

(3) Consider the cost of non-productive or lost work time while in travel status and certain other costs when comparing the costs of using Government aircraft in lieu of scheduled commercial airline service and other available modes of transportation. Additional information on costs included in the cost comparison may be found in the “U.S. Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide,” published by the General Services Administration, Office of Government-wide Policy. To obtain a copy of the guide, please contact

(b) The aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the Government aircraft must provide your designated travel-approving official with cost estimates for a Government aircraft trip (a Federal aircraft trip cost or a CAS aircraft trip cost).

(c) When an agency operates a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings.

####### § 301-70.803 How must we authorize travel on a Government aircraft?

You must authorize travel on a Government aircraft as follows:

(a)Your agency must first establish written standards for determining the special circumstances under which it will require travelers to use Government aircraft. Then, following those standards, your agency's senior legal official or his/her principal deputy must authorize required-use travel on a trip-by-trip basis in advance and in writing, unless&#x2014;

(1) The traveler is an agency head, and the President has determined that all of his or her travel, or travel in specified categories, requires the use of Government aircraft; or

(2) Your agency head has determined in writing that all travel, or travel in specified categories, by another traveler requires the use of Government aircraft.

(b)Your agency's senior legal official or his/her principal deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by senior Federal officials on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing, except for required use travel authorized under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted. Senior Federal officials who are crewmembers or qualified non-crewmembers on a flight in which they are also traveling (being transported from point-to-point) are considered travelers and must be authorized to travel on Government aircraft according to this paragraph.

(c)If you are the sponsoring agency for a non-Federal traveler, your senior legal official or his/her deputy must authorize all travel on Government aircraft by that non-Federal traveler on a trip-by-trip basis, in advance and in writing. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's senior legal official is permitted.

(d)(1) Your agency's designated travel approving official (or anyone to whom he/she delegates this authority and who is at least one organizational level above the traveler) must authorize, in advance and in writing, all other travel on Government aircraft (by passengers, crewmembers, or qualified non-crewmembers) that is not covered in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written authorization by your agency's designated travel approving official is permitted. If your agency wishes to issue blanket travel authorizations that authorize travel on Government aircraft, such blanket authorizations must define the circumstances that must be met for using Government aircraft in compliance with this regulation and any additional agency policies. Travel on Government aircraft that does not meet the circumstances specified in the blanket travel authorization must be authorized on a trip-by-trip basis in accordance with this regulation and other applicable agency policies.

(2) When authorizing space available travel (except as authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute), you must ensure that the aircraft management office in the agency that owns or hires the aircraft has certified in writing before the flight that the aircraft is scheduled to be used for a bona fide governmental function. Bona fide governmental functions may include support for official travel. The aircraft management office must also certify that carrying a traveler(s) in space available does not cause the need for a larger aircraft or result in more than minor additional cost to the Government. The aircraft management office must retain this certification for two years. In an emergency situation, prior verbal confirmation of this information with an after-the-fact written certification is permitted.

####### § 301-70.804 What amount must the Government be reimbursed for travel on a Government aircraft?

(a) No reimbursement is required for official travel on a Government aircraft.

(b) For personal travel on Government aircraft, reimbursement depends upon which of the following special cases applies:

(1) You must require a traveler on required-use travel to reimburse the Government for the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken on a trip over the full coach fare for the flights that he/she would have taken had he/she not engaged in personal activities during the trip; and

(2) No reimbursement is required for travel authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2648 and regulations implementing that statute, or when the traveler and his/her dependents are stationed by the Government in a remote location with no access to regularly scheduled commercial airline service.

(c) For political travel on a Government aircraft (for any trip or part of a trip during which the traveler engages in political activities), you must require that the Government be reimbursed the excess of the full coach fare for all flights taken on the trip over the full coach fare for the flights that the traveler would have taken had he/she not engaged in political activities, except if other law or regulation specifies a different amount (see, e.g., 11 CFR 106.3, “Allocation of Expenses between Campaign and Non-campaign Related Travel”), in which case the amount reimbursed is the amount required by such law or regulation.

####### § 301-70.805 Must we include special information on a travel authorization for a senior Federal official or a non-Federal traveler who travels on Government aircraft?

Yes, you must include the following information on a travel authorization for a senior Federal official or a non-Federal traveler:

Bona fide governmental functions may include support for official travel. You must also certify that carrying a passenger in space available does not cause the need for a larger aircraft and does not result in more than minor additional cost to the Government. Your aircraft management office must retain this certification for two years. In an emergency situation, prior verbal approval with an after-the-fact written certification is permitted.

####### § 301-70.903 What are our responsibilities for ensuring that Government aircraft are the most cost-effective alternative for travel?

To help ensure that Government aircraft are the most cost-effective alternative for travel, your aircraft management office must calculate the cost of a trip on your aircraft, whether Federal aircraft or CAS aircraft, and submit that information to the traveler's designated travel-approving official upon request. The designated travel-approving official must use that information to compare the cost of using Government aircraft with the cost of scheduled commercial airline service and the cost of using other available modes of transportation. When you operate a Government aircraft to fulfill a non-travel related governmental function or for required use travel, using any space available for passengers on official travel is presumed to result in cost savings.

Yes, when the employee is in a continuous travel status and

(a) You review each outstanding travel advance on a periodic basis (the period will be for a reasonable time of 45 days or less); and

(b) You determine the amount, if any, of the outstanding balance exceeds the amount of estimated travel expenses for the authorized period and collect the excess amount from the employee.

####### § 301-71.307 How do we collect the amount of a travel advance in excess of the amount of travel expenses substantiated by the employee?

When the outstanding advance exceeds what you owe the employee, then the employee must submit cash or a check for the difference in accordance with your policy. Your failure to collect the amount in excess of substantiated expenses will cause a violation of the accountable plan rules contained in the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 of the United States Code).

####### § 301-71.308 What should we do if the employee does not pay back a travel advance when the travel claim is filed?

You should take alternative steps to collect the debt including:

###### Subpart A - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 301-74.1 What policies must we follow in planning a conference?

When planning a conference, you must:

(a) Minimize all conference costs, including administrative costs, conference attendees' travel costs, and conference attendees' time costs;

(b) Maximize the use of Government-owned or Government provided conference facilities as much as possible;

(c) Identify opportunities to reduce costs in selecting a particular conference location and facility (e.g., through the availability of lower rates during the off-season at a site with seasonal rates); and

(d) Ensure that the conference planner or designee does not retain for personal use any promotional benefits or materials received from a travel service provider as a result of booking the conference (§§ 301&#x2013;53.2 and 301&#x2013;53.3 of this chapter); and

(e) Develop and establish internal policies to ensure these standards are met.

####### § 301-74.2 What costs should be considered when planning a conference?

When planning a conference, you should consider all direct and indirect conference costs paid by the Government, whether paid directly by agencies or reimbursed by agencies to travelers or others associated with the conference. Some examples of such costs are:

(a) Authorized travel and per diem expenses;

(b) Hire of rooms for official business;

(c) Audiovisual and other equipment usage;

(d) Computer and telephone access fees;

(e) Light refreshments;

(f) Printing;

(g) Registration fees;

(h) Ground transportation; and

(i) Employees' time at the conference and on en route travel.

####### § 301-74.3 What must we do to determine which conference expenditures result in the greatest advantage to the Government?

To determine conference expenditures, you must:

(a) Assure there is appropriate management oversight of the conference planning process;

(b) Always do cost comparisons of the size, scope, and location of the proposed conference;

(c) Determine if a Government facility is available at a cheaper rate than a commercial facility;

(d) Consider alternatives to a conference, e.g., teleconferencing; and

(e) Maintain written documentation of the alternatives considered and the selection rationale used.

####### § 301-74.4 What should cost comparisons include?

Cost comparisons should include, but not be limited to, a determination of adequacy of lodging rooms at the established per diem rates, overall convenience of the conference location, fees, availability of meeting space, equipment, and supplies, and commuting or travel distance of attendees.

####### § 301-74.5 How should we select a location and a facility?

Site selection is a final decision as to where to hold your conference. The term “site” refers to both the geographical location and the specific facility(ies) selected. In determining the best site in the interest of the Government, you should exercise strict fiscal responsibility to minimize costs. The actions in § 301&#x2013;74.3 must be followed. Cost comparisons must cover factors such as those listed in § 301&#x2013;74.4. As part of the cost comparison, you must use the established per diem rate for the locations for which you are comparing costs.

####### § 301-74.6 What can we do if we cannot find an appropriate conference facility at the chosen locality per diem rate?

While it is always desirable to obtain lodging facilities within the established lodging portion of the per diem rate for the chosen locality, it may not always be possible. In those instances when lodging is not available at the applicable per diem rate, travelers should construct a cost comparison of all associated costs, including round-trip ground transportation, between finding lodging at the applicable per diem rate away from the conference locality and using the actual expense method at the conference locality as prescribed in subpart D of part 301&#x2013;11 of this chapter.

This provision also applies to the government of the District of Columbia when it expends Federal funds for a conference and any non-Federal entity which uses Government funds to sponsor or fund a conference.

####### § 301-74.10 May we waive the requirement in § 301-74.9?

Yes, if the head of your agency makes a written determination on an individual case basis that waiver of the requirement to use approved accommodations is necessary in the public interest for a particular event. Your agency head may delegate this waiver authority to a senior agency official or employee who is given waiver authority with respect to all conferences sponsored or funded, in whole or in part, by your agency.

####### § 301-74.11 What must be included in any advertisement or application form relating to conference attendance?

Any advertisement or application for attendance at a conference described in § 301&#x2013;74.9 must include notice of the prohibition against using a non-FEMA approved place of public accommodation for conferences. In addition, any executive agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, shall notify all non-Federal entities to which it provides Federal funds of this prohibition.

####### § 301-74.12 What special rules apply when a conference is held in the District of Columbia?

In addition to the general rules provided in this part, the following special rules apply:

(a) You may not directly procure lodging facilities in the District of Columbia without specific authorization and appropriation from Congress (see 40 U.S.C. 8141); and

(b) It is no longer mandatory that you contact GSA for meeting or conference facilities in the District of Columbia.

####### § 301-74.13 What policies and procedures must we establish to govern the selection of conference attendees?

You must establish policies that reduce the overall cost of conference attendance. The policies and procedures must:

(a) Limit your agency's representation to the minimum number of attendees determined by a senior official necessary to accomplish your agency's mission; and

(b) Provide for the consideration of travel expenses when selecting attendees.

####### § 301-74.14 What records must we maintain to document the selection of a conference site?

For each conference you sponsor or fund, in whole or in part for 30 or more attendees, you must maintain a record of the cost of each alternative conference site considered. You must consider at least three sites. You must make these records available for inspection by your Office of the Inspector General or other interested parties.

###### Subpart B - Conference Attendees

####### § 301-74.21 What is the applicable M&IE rate when meals or light refreshments are furnished by the Government or are included in the registration fee?

When meals or light refreshments are furnished by the Government or are included in the registration fee the applicable M&IE will be calculated as follows:

(a) If meals are furnished, the appropriate deduction from the M&IE rate must be made (see § 301&#x2013;11.18 of this chapter).

(b) If light refreshments are furnished, no deduction of the M&IE allowance is required.

####### § 301-74.22 When should actual expense reimbursement be authorized for conference attendees?

You may authorize actual expenses under § 301&#x2013;11.300 of this chapter when the applicable lodging rate is inadequate.

####### § 301-74.23 May we reimburse travelers for an advanced payment of a conference or training registration fee?

Yes, you may reimburse travelers for an advanced discounted payment for a conference or training registration fee as soon as you have approved their travel to that event, and they submit a proper claim for the expenses incurred.

####### § 301-74.24 What is the traveler required to do if he/she is unable to attend an event for which they were reimbursed for an advanced discounted payment of a conference or training registration fee?

In all cases where a traveler is unable to attend an event for which a discounted registration fee was paid and reimbursed in advance of the event, the traveler must seek a refund of the registration fee and repay the agency with any refund received. If no refund is made, the agency must absorb the advanced payment if the traveler's failure to attend the event was caused either by an agency decision or for reasons beyond the employee's control that are acceptable to the agency, e.g., unforeseen illness or emergency. If no refund is made, and the traveler's failure to attend the scheduled event is due to reasons deemed unexcusable by the agency, the traveler must repay the agency for the amount advanced.

(a) The distance test is met when the new official station is at least 50 miles further from the employee's current residence than the old official station is from the same residence. For example, if the old official station is 3 miles from the current residence, then the new official station must be at least 53 miles from that same residence in order to receive relocation expenses for residence transactions. The distance between the official station and residence is the shortest of the commonly traveled routes between them. The distance test does not take into consideration the location of a new residence. This follows the distance guidelines found in

(b) The head of your agency or designee may authorize an exception to the 50-mile threshold on a case-by-case basis when the authorized official determines that it is in the best interest of the Government. The determination must take into consideration such factors as commuting time and distance between the employee's residence at the time of notification of transfer and the new official station.

(c) Any relocation must be incidental to the transfer and not for the convenience of the employee.

####### § 302-2.7 What happens if I attempt to defraud the Government?

You may authorize reimbursement for relocation expenses:

(a) When you have determined that an eligible individual's relocation is in the best interest of the Government as specified in § 302&#x2013;1.1 of this chapter; and

(b) Only after an eligible individual has signed a service agreement to remain in service for the period specified in § 302&#x2013;2.14.

On the TA, you must state the:

(a) Specific allowances that the employee is authorized; and

(b) Procedures that the employee is authorized to follow.

####### § 302-2.105 When an employee transfers between Federal agencies, who is responsible for paying the employee's relocation expenses?

When an employee transfers between Federal agencies, all allowable expenses must be paid from the funds of the agency that the employee is transferring to. However, in the case of a reduction in force or transfer of function, an agreement may be made between the agencies concerned as to what relocation allowances will be paid by either agency or split between them. This should include the payment of expenses for the extended storage of the employee's household goods when assigned to an isolated permanent duty station within CONUS or a transfer to, from, or between foreign countries.

####### § 302-2.106 May we waive statutory or regulatory limitations relating to relocation allowances for employees relocating to/from remote or isolated locations?

###### Subpart F - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-3.500 What governing policies and procedures must we establish for paying a relocation allowance under this part 302-3?

You must establish how you will implement policies that are required for this part, which include;

(a) When you will pay relocation expenses if an employee violates his/her service agreement;

(b) Procedures which will provide new appointees with information surrounding his/her benefits.

####### § 302-3.502 What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize a TCS for a long-term assignment?

You should consider the following factors in determining whether to authorize a TCS:

(a)You should consider the cost of each alternative. A long-term temporary duty travel assignment requires the payment of either per diem or actual subsistence expenses for the entire period of the assignment. This could be very costly to the agency over an extended period. A TCS will require fairly substantial relocation allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment, and less substantial payments for extended storage and property management services, when authorized, during the period of the assignment. Agencies should estimate the total cost of each alternative and authorize the one that is most advantageous for the agency, cost and other factors considered;

(b)An employee who performs a temporary duty travel assignment exceeding one year at a single location is subject to income taxation of his/her travel expense reimbursements. The Withholding Tax Allowance and the Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance allow for the reimbursement of Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of taxable extended temporary duty assignments (see §§ 301&#x2013;11.601&#x2014;301&#x2013;11.605 of this Subtitle). An employee who is authorized and performs a TCS also will be subject to income taxation of some, but not all, of his/her TCS expenses. You will pay an offsetting Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance on an employee's TCS expense reimbursements; and

(c)The long-term assignment of an employee away from his/her official station and immediate family may negatively affect the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport his/her immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the location where he/she will perform the long-term assignment. You should consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.

Yes, you must establish a minimum driving distance not less than an average of 300 miles per day. However, an exception to the daily minimum driving distance may be made when the delay is:

(a) Beyond control of the employee, e.g., results from acts of God or restrictions by Government officials;

(b) Due to a physical handicap; or

(c) For other reasons acceptable to you.

####### § 302-4.705 What are the allowances if the employee uses more POVs than authorized?

If the employee uses more POVs than authorized, reimbursement will be made as if all persons traveled in the number of POVs that you authorized.

##### PART 302-5 - ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSEHUNTING TRIP EXPENSES

###### Subpart A - Employee's Allowance For Househunting Trip Expenses

####### § 302-5.1 What is a “househunting trip”?

The term “househunting trip” refers to a trip made by the employee and/or spouse to your new official station locality to find permanent living quarters to rent or purchase. The term “living quarters” in this part includes apartments, condominiums, and cooperatives in addition to townhouses and single family homes.

####### § 302-5.2 What is the purpose of the househunting trip expenses allowance?

The allowance for househunting trip expenses is intended to facilitate and expedite the employee's move from your old official station to your new official station and to lower the Government's overall cost for the employee's relocation by reducing the amount of time an employee must occupy temporary quarters. The allowance for househunting trip expenses provides the employee and/or spouse a period of time to concentrate on finding a suitable permanent residence at the new official station and thereby expedites the employee's relocation.

####### § 302-5.3 Am I eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

You are eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer, and in addition:

(a) Both your old and new official stations are located within the United States;

(b) You are not assigned to Government or other prearranged housing at your new official station; and

(c) Your old and new official stations are 75 or more miles apart (as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.

####### § 302-5.4 Who is not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

New appointees and employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109) are not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance.

####### § 302-5.5 Must my agency authorize payment of a househunting trip expenses allowance?

No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest to authorize you a househunting trip and the procedures you must follow if it is authorized.

####### § 302-5.6 Under what circumstances will I receive a househunting trip expenses allowance?

You will receive a househunting trip expenses allowance if:

(a) Your agency authorized you to perform a househunting trip in advance of the travel (the agency authorization must specify the mode of transportation and the period of time allowed for the trip);

(b) You have signed a service agreement;

(c) Your agency has established, and informed you of, the date you are to report to your new official station; and

(d) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.

####### § 302-5.7 Who may travel on a househunting trip at Government expense?

Only you and/or your spouse may travel on a househunting trip at Government expense.

####### § 302-5.8 How many househunting trips may my agency authorize in connection with a particular transfer?

Your agency may authorize only one round trip for you and/or your spouse in connection with a particular transfer.

####### § 302-5.9 May my spouse and I perform separate househunting trips at Government expense?

Yes, however, your reimbursement will be limited to the cost that would have been incurred if you and your spouse had traveled together on one round trip.

####### § 302-5.10 How soon may I and/or my spouse begin a househunting trip?

You may begin your househunting trip as soon as your agency has notified you of your transfer and issued a travel authorization for a househunting trip. To take maximum advantage of your trip, however, it is very important that you become familiar as quickly as you can with your new official station area (e.g., housing market conditions, school locations, etc.). If you are selling your residence at your old official station, you should not begin your househunting trip until you have a current appraisal of the value of the residence so that you can more accurately determine the appropriate price range of residences to consider during your househunting trip.

####### § 302-5.11 Is there a time limit on the duration of a househunting trip?

A househunting trip should be for a reasonable period, not to exceed 10 calendar days, as authorized by your agency under § 302&#x2013;5.101(d).

####### § 302-5.12 When must my househunting trip be completed?

You and/or your spouse must complete your househunting trip as indicated in the following table:

####### § 302-5.13 What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for househunting trip expenses?

Your agency will reimburse your househunting trip expenses as indicated in the following table:

####### § 302-5.14 What transportation expenses will my agency pay?

(a) Your agency will authorize you to travel by any transportation mode(s) (e.g., common carrier or POV) that it determines to be advantageous to the Government. Your agency will pay for your transportation expenses by the authorized mode(s). If you travel by one or more mode(s) other than the one(s) authorized by your agency, your agency will pay your transportation expenses up to the constructive cost of transportation by the authorized mode(s). For trips of less than 250 miles, your agency will authorize travel by POV, unless there are reasons for not using a POV that are acceptable to the agency (e.g., traveler is physically impaired, does not own or lease a POV, has only one POV that is used for family transportation, or the POV is not roadworthy for such a trip). POV mileage reimbursement will be in accordance with § 302&#x2013;4.300 of this chapter.

(b) Unless the agency performs a written cost comparison that demonstrates cost savings, only common carrier may be authorized for trips with a distance of 250 miles or more.

####### § 302-5.15 Must I document my househunting trip expenses to receive reimbursement?

To receive reimbursement for househunting trip transportation expenses you must itemize your transportation expenses and provide receipts as required by §§ 301&#x2013;11.25, 301&#x2013;11.306 and 301&#x2013;52.4(b) of chapter 301. For lump sum househunting trip subsistence reimbursement, you do not need to document your subsistence expenses. For per diem househunting trip subsistence expense reimbursement, you must itemize your lodging expenses and you must provide receipts as required by §§ 301&#x2013;7.9(b), 301&#x2013;11.25, 301&#x2013;11.306 and 301&#x2013;52.4(b) of chapter 301.

####### § 302-5.16 May I receive an advance of funds for househunting trip expenses?

Your agency may authorize an advance of funds, in accordance with §§ 302&#x2013;2.23, 302&#x2013;2.24, and 302&#x2013;2.25 of this chapter, for your househunting trip expenses. Your agency may not advance you funds in excess of the sum of your anticipated transportation costs and either the maximum per diem allowable under part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter for the location and duration of your househunting trip or your lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses payment, whichever applies.

####### § 302-5.17 Am I in a duty status when I perform a househunting trip?

Yes, you are in a duty status when you perform a househunting trip.

####### § 302-5.18 May I retain any balance left over from my househunting reimbursement if my lump sum is more than adequate to cover my househunting trip?

Yes, if your lump sum househunting amount is more than adequate to cover your househunting expenses any balance belongs to you.

###### Subpart B - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-5.100 How should we administer the househunting trip expenses allowance?

You should administer the househunting trip expenses allowance to minimize or avoid its use when other satisfactory and more economical arrangement are available.

####### § 302-5.101 What governing policies must we establish for the househunting trip expenses allowance?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) When you will authorize a househunting trip for an employee;

(b) Who will determine if a househunting trip is appropriate in each situation;

(c) If and when you will authorize the lump sum option for househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement;

(d) Who will determine the appropriate duration of a househunting trip for an employee who selects a per diem allowance under part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter to reimburse househunting trip subsistence expenses; and

(e) Who will determine the mode(s) of transportation to be used.

####### § 302-5.102 Under what circumstances may we authorize a househunting trip?

You may authorize a househunting trip on an individual-case basis when the employee has accepted the transfer and his/her circumstances indicate that a househunting trip actually is needed. You may not authorize a househunting trip when the purpose of the trip is to assist the employee in deciding whether he or she will accept the transfer.

####### § 302-5.103 What modes of transportation may we authorize for a househunting trip?

(a) When the new official station is less than 250 miles from the old official station, the required mode of transportation is POV, unless there are reasons for not using a POV that are acceptable to the you (e.g., traveler is physically impaired, does not own or lease a POV, has only one POV which is used for family transportation, or the POV is not roadworthy for such a trip). Reimbursement for POV mileage is at the rate prescribed in § 302&#x2013;4.300 of this subchapter.

(b) When the new official station is 250 miles or more from the old official station, the preferred mode of transportation is common carrier. However, you may authorize the use of POV for a househunting trip longer than 250 miles, provided you complete a written cost comparison in accordance with § 302&#x2013;5.14(b).

####### § 302-5.104 What factors must we consider in determining whether to offer an employee the fixed amount househunting trip subsistence expense reimbursement option?

You must consider the following factors:

(a)Payment of a per diem allowance under part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter requires you to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount, except for meals and incidental expenses. Lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement is easier to administer because you do not have to review expense amounts.

(b)You must weigh the cost of each reimbursement option on a case-by-case basis.

(c)The employee is allowed to choose between a per diem allowance under part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter and lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement when you offer the lump sum reimbursement method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.

##### PART 302-6 - ALLOWANCE FOR TEMPORARY QUARTERS SUBSISTENCE EXPENSES

###### Subpart A - General Rules

####### § 302-6.1 What are “temporary quarters?'

The term “temporary quarters” refers to lodging obtained for the purpose of temporary occupancy from a private or commercial source.

####### § 302-6.2 What are “temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE)”?

“Temporary quarters subsistence expenses” or “TQSE” are subsistence expenses incurred by an employee and/or his/her immediate family while occupying temporary quarters. TQSE does not include transportation expenses incurred during occupancy of temporary quarters (see § 302&#x2013;6.18 for details).

####### § 302-6.3 What is the purpose of the TQSE allowance?

The TQSE allowance is intended to reimburse an employee reasonably and equitably for subsistence expenses incurred when it is necessary to occupy temporary quarters.

####### § 302-6.4 Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance?

You are eligible for a TQSE allowance if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer; and

(a) Your new official station is located within the United States; and

(b) Your old and new official stations are 50 miles or more apart (as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.

####### § 302-6.5 Who is not eligible for a TQSE allowance?

New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees returning from an overseas assignment for the purpose of separation are not eligible for a TQSE allowance.

####### § 302-6.6 Must my agency authorize payment of a TQSE allowance?

No, your agency determines whether it is in the Government's interest to pay TQSE.

####### § 302-6.7 Under what circumstances will I receive a TQSE allowance?

You will receive a TQSE allowance if:

(a) Your agency authorizes it before you occupy the temporary quarters (the agency authorization must specify the period of time allowed for you to occupy temporary quarters);

(b) You have signed a service agreement; and

(c) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.

####### § 302-6.8 Who may occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

Only you and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters at Government expense.

####### § 302-6.9 Where may I/we occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

You and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters at Government expense within reasonable proximity of your old and/or new official stations. Neither you nor your immediate family may be reimbursed for occupying temporary quarters at any other location, unless justified by special circumstances that are reasonably related to your transfer.

####### § 302-6.10 May my immediate family and I occupy temporary quarters at different locations?

Yes. For example, if you must vacate your home at the old official station and report to the new official station and your family remains behind until the end of the school year, you may need to occupy temporary quarters at the new official station while your family occupies temporary quarters at the old official station.

####### § 302-6.11 What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for TQSE?

Your agency will reimburse you for TQSE under the actual expense method unless it permits the “lump sum” reimbursement method as an alternative. If your agency makes both methods available to you, you may select the one you prefer.

####### § 302-6.12 Must I document my TQSE to receive reimbursement?

For lump sum TQSE reimbursement, you do not document your TQSE. For actual TQSE reimbursement, you must document your TQSE by itemizing each expense and providing receipts as required by §§ 301&#x2013;11.25, 301&#x2013;11.306 and 301&#x2013;52.4(b) of this title.

####### § 302-6.13 How soon may I/we begin occupying temporary quarters at Government expense?

As soon as your agency has authorized you to receive a TQSE allowance and you have signed a service agreement.

####### § 302-6.14 How is my TQSE allowance affected if my temporary quarters become my permanent residence quarters?

If your temporary quarters become your permanent residence quarters, you may receive a TQSE allowance only if you show in a manner satisfactory to your agency that you initially intended to occupy the quarters temporarily.

####### § 302-6.15 May I receive an advance of funds for TQSE?

Yes, if authorized in accordance with §§ 302&#x2013;2.23, 302&#x2013;2.24, and 302&#x2013;2.25 of this chapter, your agency may advance the amount of funds necessary to cover your estimated TQSE expenses for up to 30 days. Your agency subsequently may advance additional funds for periods up to 30 days.

####### § 302-6.16 May I receive a TQSE allowance if I am receiving another subsistence expenses allowance?

No, with one exception. You may receive a cost-of-living allowance payable under 5 U.S.C. 5941 in addition to a TQSE allowance.

####### § 302-6.17 Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance if I transfer to a foreign area?

No, you may not receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you transfer to an area outside the United States. However, you may qualify for a comparable allowance under the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) prescribed by the Department of State.

####### § 302-6.18 May I be reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred while I am occupying temporary quarters?

Transportation expenses incurred in the vicinity of the temporary quarters are not TQSE, and therefore, there is no authority to pay such expenses under TQSE.

###### Subpart B - Actual TQSE Method of Reimbursement

####### § 302-6.100 What am I paid under the actual TQSE reimbursement method?

Your agency will pay your actual TQSE incurred, provided the expenses are reasonable and do not exceed the maximum allowable amount. The “maximum allowable amount” is the “maximum daily amount” multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change after 30 days in temporary quarters. The “maximum daily amount” is determined by adding the rates in the following table for you and each member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

####### § 302-6.101 May my agency reduce my TQSE allowance below the “maximum allowable amount”?

Yes, if the estimated daily amount of your TQSE is determined in advance to be lower than the maximum daily amount, your agency may reduce the maximum allowable amount to your expected expenses.

####### § 302-6.102 What is the “applicable per diem rate” under the actual TQSE reimbursement method?

The “applicable per diem rate” under the actual TQSE reimbursement method is as follows:

####### § 302-6.103 What is the latest period for which actual TQSE reimbursement may begin?

The period must begin before the maximum time for beginning allowable travel and transportation under § 302&#x2013;2.9.

####### § 302-6.104 How long may I be authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement?

Your agency may authorize you to claim actual TQSE in increments of 30-days or less, not to exceed 60 consecutive days. However, if your agency determines that there is a compelling reason for you to continue occupying temporary quarters after 60 consecutive days, it may authorize an extension of up to 60 additional consecutive days. Under no circumstances may you be authorized reimbursement for actual TQSE for more than a total of 120 consecutive days.

####### § 302-6.105 What is a “compelling reason” warranting extension of my authorized period for claiming an actual TQSE reimbursement?

A “compelling reason” is an event that is beyond your control and is acceptable to your agency. Examples include, but are not limited to when:

(a) Delivery of your household goods to your new residence is delayed due to strikes, customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, floods or other acts of God, or similar events.

(b) You cannot occupy your new permanent residence because of unanticipated problems (e.g., delay in settlement on the new residence, or short-term delay in construction of the residence).

(c) You are unable to locate a permanent residence which is adequate for your family's needs because of housing conditions at your new official station.

(d) Sudden illness, injury, your death or the death of your immediate family member; or

(e) Similar reasons.

####### § 302-6.106 May I interrupt occupancy of temporary quarters?

Yes, your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement is measured on consecutive days, and once begun, normally continues to run whether or not you occupy temporary quarters. You may, however, interrupt your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement in the following instances:

(a) For the time allowed for en route travel between the old and new official stations;

(b) For circumstances attributable to official necessity such as an intervening temporary duty assignment or military duty; or

(c) For a non-official necessary interruption such as hospitalization, approved sick leave, or other reason beyond your control and acceptable to your agency.

####### § 302-6.107 What effect do partial days of temporary quarters occupancy have on my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement?

Occupancy of temporary quarters for less than a whole day constitutes one full day of your authorized period. (However, see § 302&#x2013;6.110 regarding en route travel.)

####### § 302-6.108 When does my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement end?

The period ends at midnight on the earlier of:

(a) The day preceding the day you and/or any member of your immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters.

(b) The day your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement expires.

####### § 302-6.109 May the period for which I am authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement for myself be different from that of my immediate family?

No, the eligibility period for which you are authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement for yourself and for each member of your immediate family must run concurrently.

####### § 302-6.110 What effect do partial days have on my actual TQSE reimbursement?

You may not receive reimbursement under both the actual TQSE allowance and another subsistence expenses allowance within the same day, with one exception. If you claim TQSE reimbursement on the same day that en route travel per diem ends, your en route travel per diem will be computed under applicable partial day rules and you also may be reimbursed for actual TQSE you incur after 6 p.m. of that day.

####### § 302-6.111 May I and/or my immediate family occupy temporary quarters longer than the period for which I am authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement?

Yes, but you will not be reimbursed for any of the expenses you incur during the unauthorized period.

###### Subpart C - Lump Sum Payment

####### § 302-6.200 What am I paid under the TQSE lump sum payment method?

If your agency offers, and you select the lump sum TQSE payment, you are paid a lump sum for each day authorized up to 30 days. The maximum number of days that may be used for the TQSE lump sum calculation is 30; no extensions are allowed under the lump sum payment method.

####### § 302-6.201 How do I determine the amount of my TQSE lump sum payment?

(a) For yourself, multiply the number of days your agency authorizes TQSE by .75 times the maximum per diem rate (that is, lodging plus meals and incidental expenses) prescribed by § 301&#x2013;11.6 of this subtitle for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever TQ will be occupied. Please note that for non-foreign OCONUS, the Department of Defense Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowances Committee establishes the per diem rate, and for foreign OCONUS, the Department of State establishes the per diem rates.

(b) For each member of your immediate family, multiply the same number of days by .25 times the same per diem rate, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Your lump sum payment will be the sum of the calculations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

####### § 302-6.202 Will I receive additional TQSE reimbursement if my TQSE lump sum payment is not adequate to cover my actual TQSE?

No, you will not receive additional TQSE reimbursement if the lump sum payment is not adequate to cover your actual TQSE.

####### § 302-6.203 May I retain any balance left over from my TQSE lump sum payment if such payment is more than adequate?

Yes, if your lump sum TQSE payment is more than adequate to cover your actual TQSE expenses, any balance belongs to you. (E.g., if your agency authorizes and you accept a lump sum payment for 15 days of TQSE and you vacate TQ after 10 days for any reason, you would retain the remaining balance for the 5 days of TQSE not incurred).

####### § 302-6.204 Am I required to file a voucher after occupying temporary quarters if I selected the TQSE lump sum payment?

No, you are not required to file a voucher after occupying temporary quarters if you have selected the lump sum payment. The intent of the lump sum payment is to simplify the process and eliminate the need for filing a voucher. However, your agency may require that you sign a voucher or other document before they pay your lump sum TQSE to you, and your agency may at any time request proof that you actually occupied TQ, even if not for the full length of time on which the lump sum calculation was based. In the absence of sufficient proof of TQSE occupancy, your agency may demand repayment of the TQSE lump sum payment in accordance with § 302&#x2013;6.305.

###### Subpart D - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-6.300 How should we administer the TQSE allowance?

Temporary quarters should be used only if, and only for as long as, necessary until the employee and/or his/her immediate family can move into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.

####### § 302-6.301 What governing policies must we establish for the TQSE allowance?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) When you will authorize temporary quarters for employees;

(b) Who will determine if temporary quarters is appropriate in each situation;

(c) If and when you will authorize the lump sum option for TQSE reimbursement;

(d) Who will determine the appropriate period of time for which TQSE reimbursement will be authorized, including approval of extensions and interruptions of temporary quarters occupancy; and

(e) Who will determine whether quarters were indeed temporary, if there is any doubt.

####### § 302-6.302 Under what circumstances may we authorize the TQSE allowance?

You may authorize a TQSE allowance on an individual-case basis when use of temporary quarters is justified in connection with an employee's transfer to a new official station. You may not authorize a TQSE allowance for vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the transfer.

####### § 302-6.303 What factors should we consider in determining whether the TQSE allowance is actually necessary?

The factors you should consider include:

(a)An employee and his/her immediate family should continue to occupy the residence at the old official station for as long as practicable to avoid the necessity for temporary quarters.

(b)If a less expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less overall.

(c)Consider whether the employee had other adequate opportunity to arrange for permanent quarters. For example, you should not authorize temporary quarters if the employee had adequate opportunity during an extended temporary duty assignment to arrange for permanent quarters.

####### § 302-6.304 What factors should we consider in determining whether to offer an employee a lump sum payment option for TQSE?

When determining whether to offer an employee the lump sum payment option for TQSE the following factors should be considered:

(a)A lump sum for TQSE is paid to the employee prior to the occupancy of TQ, and the after the fact voucher process is eliminated under this method. Actual TQSE reimbursement requires an agency to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount.

(b)You should weigh the cost of each alternative. Actual TQSE reimbursement may extend up to 120 days, while the lump sum payment is limited to a maximum of 30 days.

(c)The employee is allowed to choose between actual TQSE reimbursement and the lump sum TQSE payment when you offer the lump sum payment method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.

####### § 302-6.305 Must we require transferees to sign a statement that TQSE will be incurred?

Yes, transferees electing the TQSE lump sum payment option must sign a statement, which should be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that they will occupy TQ and will incur TQSE. If no TQSE are incurred, the transferee must return all monies advanced for the lump sum TQSE payment to the agency.

####### § 302-6.306 When must we make the lump sum TQSE payment to the transferee?

You must pay the transferee the lump sum TQSE payment prior to the occupancy of TQ. You should make the lump sum TQSE payment as close as is reasonably possible to the time that the transferee will begin occupancy of TQ.

####### § 302-6.307 What factors should we consider in determining whether quarters are temporary?

In determining whether quarters are “temporary”, you should consider factors such as the duration of the lease, movement of household effects into the quarters, the type of quarters, the employee's expressions of intent, attempts to secure a permanent dwelling, and the length of time the employee occupies the quarters.

#### Subchapter D - Transportation and Storage of Property

##### PART 302-7 - TRANSPORTATION AND TEMPORARY STORAGE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS, PROFESSIONAL BOOKS, PAPERS, AND EQUIPMENT, (PBP&E) AND BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE

###### Subpart A - General Rules

####### § 302-7.1 Who is eligible for the transportation and temporary storage of household goods (HHG) at Government expense?

The following are eligible for the transportation and temporary storage of household goods (HHG) at Government expense when a relocation has been determined to be in the interest of the Government:

(a) An employee transferred between official stations, within or outside the continental United States (CONUS);

(b) A new appointee to his/her first official station within or outside the CONUS;

(c) An employee being returned to CONUS for separation from an outside CONUS assignment, after completion of an agreed upon period of services;

(d) An SES employee authorized last move home benefits under §§ 302&#x2013;3.304 through 302&#x2013;3.315 of this chapter;

(e) An employee authorized a temporary change of station (TCS).

####### § 302-7.2 What is the maximum weight of HHG that may be transported or stored at Government expense?

(a) The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight. For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment. In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials). The relocating employee is responsible for reimbursing the Government for all costs incurred if the shipment is overweight. For determining the weight of crated shipments, containerized shipments, and constructive weight for other types of household good shipments, pleasethe chart in § 302&#x2013;7.13.

(b) An agency may establish a lower net weight allowance and a lower allowance for packing materials in special circumstances, such as transferring an employee into government-furnished quarters.

####### § 302-7.3 May HHG be transported or stored in more than one lot?

Household goods may be transported and stored in multiple lots, however, your maximum HHG weight allowance is based upon shipping and storing all HHG as one lot.

####### § 302-7.4 Who pays for shipping professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP&E)?

The agency may pay for shipping PBP&E as a discretionary item. When authorized, shipping PBP&E is considered an administrative cost to the agency. However, for ease of administration in calculating this allowance, PBP&E should be included as part of the HHG shipment, if possible. That is, if the net weight of the HHG plus the PBP&E is less than 18,000 pounds, the agency should ship the items together and pay for the HHG shipment in one payment.

####### § 302-7.5 What happens if the HHG shipment includes PBP&E, and it might exceed, or did exceed, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance?

(a) Separate the PBP&E and have the HHG carrier estimate the weight of the PBP&E before the HHG shipment is picked up. Subtract 110 percent of the estimated PBP&E weight (to adjust for packing materials) from the estimated gross weight as shown on the shipping documents (net weight minus the PBP&E minus 10 percent of the PBP&E). If the result is more than the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance.

(b) If you did not discover that the HHG shipment exceeded the net weight allowance in advance, and if you did not weigh or estimate the PBP&E before shipping it, then weigh the PBP&E before it is delivered. Determine if the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance by applying the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) If the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment does not exceed the net weight allowance, then the agency may transport and pay for shipping the PBP&E plus packing materials with the household goods.

(d) However, if the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment may exceed the net weight allowance, and if the employee was authorized PBP&E, then the employee must pay for shipping all weight that exceeds the net weight allowance for their HHG, minus the PBP&E and packing materials for both. The agency may then pay for shipping the PBP&E as an administrative expense.

(e) The agency may require reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E and the weight of the PBP&E.

####### § 302-7.6 What are the authorized origin and destination points for the transportation of HHG and PBP&E?

The authorized origin and destination points for the transportation of HHG and PBP&E vary by category of employee and are listed in the following table:

####### § 302-7.7 May the origin and destination points be other than that prescribed in § 302-7.6?

Yes, shipments may originate or terminate at any location; however, your reimbursement is limited to the cost of transporting the property in one lot from the authorized origin to the authorized destination.

####### § 302-7.8 At what location can CONUS-to-CONUS or OCONUS-to-CONUS HHG shipments be temporarily stored?

Your HHG may be placed in temporary storage at origin, in transit, at destination, or any combination thereof upon agency approval.

####### § 302-7.9 What are the time limits for the temporary storage of authorized HHG shipments?

(a)The initial period of temporary storage at Government expense may not exceed 60 days. You may request additional time, up to a maximum of 90 days, and you must make such a request prior to the expiration of the original 60 days. This extension must be approved by the agency official designated for such requests. Under no circumstances may temporary storage at Government expense for CONUS to CONUS shipments exceed a total of 150 days.

(b)The initial period of temporary storage at Government expense may not exceed 90 days. You may request additional time, up to a maximum of 90 days, and you must make such a request prior to the expiration of the original 90 days. This extension must be approved by the agency official designated for such requests. Under no circumstances may temporary storage for shipments at Government expense that include an OCONUS origin or destination exceed a total of 180 days.

####### § 302-7.10 What are the reasons that would justify the additional storage beyond the initial 60 days CONUS and 90 days OCONUS limits?

Reasons for justifying temporary storage beyond the initial limit include, but are not limited to:

(a) An intervening temporary duty or long-term training assignment;

(b) Non-availability of suitable housing;

(c) Completion of residence under construction;

(d) Serious illness of employee or illness or death of a dependent; or

(e) Strikes, acts of God, or other circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

####### § 302-7.11 Is property acquired en route eligible for transportation at Government expense?

No, property acquired en route will not be eligible for transportation at Government expense.

####### § 302-7.12 What is the Government's liability for loss or damage to HHG?

The Government's liability for loss or damage to HHG is determined by your agency under title 31 U.S.C. 3721&#x2013;3723 and agency implementing rules and regulations issued pursuant to the law.

####### § 302-7.13 What are the various methods of shipping HHG and how is the weight determined for each type of shipment?

HHG should be shipped by the most economical method available. The various methods of shipment and weight calculations include the following:

####### § 302-7.14 What methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are authorized?

There are two authorized methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage. Your agency will determine which of the following methods will be authorized.

(a)Under the commuted rate system you assume total responsibility for arranging and paying for, at least the following services: packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/deliver, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage of your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier or by renting self drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move. When any PBP&E is transported as an administrative expense of your agency, all arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) will be handled and paid for by your agency.

(b)Under the actual expense method, your agency assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for all aspects (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, temporary storage, etc.), of transporting your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier.

####### § 302-7.15 Are there any disadvantages to using the commuted rate method for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage?

Yes. The disadvantages to using the commuted rate method for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are that the:

(a) Government cannot take advantage of any special rates that may be offered only to Government shipments;

(b) Commuted rate method does not apply to intrastate moves; and

(c) Commuted rate method may not fully reimburse your out-of-pocket expenses.

####### § 302-7.16 Must I use the methods selected by my agency for transportation and temporary storage of my HHG and PBP&E?

No, you do not have to use the method selected (§ 302&#x2013;7.401) by your agency for transportation and temporary storage of your HHG and PBP&E. You may pursue other methods; however, your reimbursement is limited to the actual cost incurred, not to exceed what the Government would have incurred under the method selected by your agency.

####### § 302-7.17 Is the maximum weight allowance for HHG and temporary storage limited when quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS or upon return to CONUS?

When quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS, your agency may limit the weight of HHG and temporary storage that can be transported to that location. Only the authorized weight allowance that was shipped to the OCONUS location may be returned to CONUS upon completion of the tour of duty, unless the agency makes an exception under conditions specified in agency internal regulations.

####### § 302-7.18 May PBP&E be transported at Government expense upon returning to CONUS for separation from Government service, after completion of an OCONUS assignment?

Any PBP&E that was transported as an administrative expense of the Government to the OCONUS assignment will be returned as an administrative expense of the Government to the place of actual residence or any other location, not to exceed the cost to the authorized destination.

####### § 302-7.19 Who is liable for any loss or damage to HHG incident to an authorized relocation?

When transporting HHG under the commuted rate or actual expense method and a commercial HHG carrier is used, the carrier accepts limited liability for any loss or damage in accordance with HHG carrier tariffs. For transporting HHG by self drive equipment for a do-it-yourself-move and for any loss or damage not covered by the HHG carrier, see part 302&#x2013;11 of this chapter.

####### § 302-7.20 Should I include items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value in my HHG shipment?

Generally no; items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value should not be included in your HHG shipment. Additional insurance may be purchased, at your expense, to cover any loss or damage, however, such items are not necessarily provided special security. Accordingly, it is advisable that you or an immediate family member(s) transport such items personally.

####### § 302-7.21 If my HHG shipment includes an item for which a weight additive is assessed by the HHG carrier (e.g., boat, trailer, ultralight vehicle), am I responsible for payment?

(a) No, you will not be responsible for the shipping charges that result from a weight additive so long as the actual weight of your HHG without the additive does not exceed the 18,000 pound net weight allowance for relocation. However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe).

(b) You are also responsible for the cost of special packing, crating, and handling of the weight additive items, if any.§ 302&#x2013;7.200 on how charges are paid and who makes the shipping arrangements.

###### Subpart B - Commuted Rate

####### § 302-7.100 How are the charges of transporting HHG, and temporary storage calculated?

The charges for transporting HHG, and temporary storage are computed by multiplying the number of pounds shipped divided by 100 (within the 18,000 maximum limitation) by the applicable rate per one-hundred pounds for the distance transported. This includes, but is not limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, drayage, weighing, pickup/delivery, line-haul, accessorial charges, and temporary storage charges, including but not limited to handling in/out, etc. However, your reimbursement may not fully cover your total out-of-pocket expenses. In determining the distance shipped you may use the tariffs filed with GSA travel management centers or any other mileage guide authorized by your agency. If the exact mileage is not shown, the next higher mileage distance applies. If there is a minimum weight charge above the actual weight under applicable tariffs, reimbursement will be based on the minimum weight charge instead of the actual weight.

####### § 302-7.101 Where can the commuted rate schedules for the transportation of HHG and temporary storage be found?

The commuted rate table is published at

####### § 302-7.102 How is the mileage distance determined under the commuted rate method?

To determine the distance from the authorized origin to the authorized destination, you may use the tariffs filed with GSA travel management centers or any other mileage guide authorized by your agency.

####### § 302-7.103 How are the charges calculated when a carrier charges a minimum weight, but the actual weight of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage is less than the minimum weight charged?

Charges for HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are calculated based on the minimum weight charged by the carrier, but not to exceed 18,000 pounds.

####### § 302-7.104 What documentation must be provided for reimbursement?

When claiming reimbursement under the commuted rate, you must provide:

(a) A receipted copy of the bill of lading (reproduced copies are acceptable) including any attached weight certificate copies if issued; or

(b) Other evidence showing points of origin and destination and the weight of your HHG, if no bill of lading was issued, or

(c) If a commercial HHG carrier is not used, you are responsible for establishing the weight of the HHG, and temporary storage by obtaining proper certified weight certificates. Certified weight certificates include the gross and tare weights. This is required because payment at commuted rates on the basis of constructive weight usually is not possible.

####### § 302-7.105 May an advance of funds be authorized for transporting HHG and temporary storage?

An advance of funds may be authorized when the transportation of HHG and temporary storage is authorized under the commuted rate method.

####### § 302-7.106 What documentation is required to receive an advance under the commuted rate method?

To receive an advance under the commuted rate method, you must provide a copy of an estimate of costs from a commercial HHG carrier or a written statement that includes:

(a) Origin and destination;

(b) A signed copy of a commercial bill of lading annotated with actual weight (or other evidence of actual weight) or a reasonable estimate acceptable to your agency; and

(c) Anticipated temporary storage period (not to exceed 90 days) at Government expense.

####### § 302-7.107 May my HHG be temporarily stored at Government expense?

Yes, HHG may be stored at Government expense incident to the transporting of such goods either at the HHG carrier storage facility or a self storage facility. Storage may be at any combination of origin, en route locations or destination.

####### § 302-7.108 What temporary storage expenses will be reimbursed?

The following will be reimbursed:

(a) Reimbursable temporary storage cost incident to storage at the HHG carriers facility are:

(1) Handling in;

(2) Daily storage;

(3) Handling out; and

(4) Drayage to residence.

(b) Reimbursable cost of storage at a self storage facility. This is the cost of the storage space that will reasonably accommodate the HHG transported.

####### § 302-7.109 Are receipts required?

Yes, under the commuted rate system, a receipted copy of the warehouse or other bill for storage is required to support reimbursement.

####### § 302-7.110 Is there a reimbursement limit?

Yes, reimbursement must not exceed the limits in the commuted rate table published by GSA and found at

###### Subpart C - Actual Expense Method

####### § 302-7.200 How are charges paid and who makes the arrangements for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage under the actual expense method?

Your agency is responsible for making all the necessary arrangements for transporting HHG, PBP&E, and temporary storage, including but not limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, etc., under the actual expense method. Your agency will issue a Bill of Lading or any other shipping document with all charges billed directly to the agency. Any cost or weight in excess of 18,000 pounds will be at your expense. If the shipment exceeds the maximum weight prescribed in § 302&#x2013;7.2, the Government will pay the total charges and the employee will reimburse the Government for the cost of transportation and other charges applicable to the excess weight.

####### § 302-7.201 Is temporary storage in excess of authorized limits and excess valuation of goods and services payable at Government expense?

No, charges for excess weight, valuation above the minimum amount, and services obtained at higher costs must be borne by the employee in the same manner as he/she is responsible for excess transportation costs.

###### Subpart D - Baggage Allowance

####### § 302-7.300 When may I be authorized an unaccompanied air baggage (UAB) shipment?

UAB is used in connection with permanent change of station OCONUS, renewal agreement travel, and temporary change of station. You may be authorized a UAB shipment prior to transferring from a CONUS location to an OCONUS location, between OCONUS locations, or from an OCONUS location to a CONUS location. UAB for CONUS to CONUS shipments is not allowed under the FTR.

####### § 302-7.301 Is my UAB shipment in addition to the 18,000 pounds net weight of the HHG weight allowance?

No, for all shipments made under the authority of the FTR, the UAB shipment is part of, not in addition to, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG.

####### § 302-7.302 What is the maximum weight allowance for a UAB shipment?

The maximum weight allowance your agency may grant for a UAB shipment is&#x2014;

(a) Up to 350 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for the employee and each immediate family member 12 years of age and over; or

(b) Up to 175 pounds actual weight (including the weight of the luggage or packing material) for each immediate family member under 12 years of age.

####### § 302-7.303 When may my agency authorize the shipment of UAB by expedited means?

Your agency may authorize the shipment of UAB by expedited means when:

(a) Shipment by a lower cost mode cannot deliver the items being shipped by the time they will be needed by the employee and/or the employee's immediate family; or

(b) You certify that expedited shipment of your UAB is necessary to carry out your assigned duties; or

(c) Your agency determines that an expedited shipment is necessary to prevent undue hardship to you and members of your immediate family.

####### § 302-7.304 Who makes arrangements for transporting my UAB?

Your agency or your agency's designee should arrange for the transport of your UAB. In limited situations, the agency may ask the employee to make the arrangements for a UAB shipment.

####### § 302-7.305 When must my agency ship my UAB?

Your agency must ship your UAB in time to ensure that your shipment arrives by the time you (and/or your family) report to your new official station. Arrangements should begin prior to your and/or your family's departure to your new official station.

###### Subpart E - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-7.400 What policies and procedures must we establish for this subpart?

You must establish policies and procedures as required for this subpart, including who will:

(a) Administer your household goods program;

(b) Authorize commuted rate or actual expense for transportation and payment for HHG, PBP&E, and temporary storage;

(c) Authorize PBP&E to be transported as an agency administrative expense in accordance with FTR guidelines (usually the authorizing official for PBP&E will be at the employee's new official station);

(d) Authorize an employee to ship UAB;

(e) Collect any excess costs or charges;

(f) Advise the employee on the Government's liability for any personal property damage or loss claims (31 U.S.C. 3721,);

(g) Ensure that international HHG shipments by water are made on ships registered under the laws of the United States whenever such ships are available (The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (10 U.S.C. 2631) and The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (46 U.S.C. 55302));

(h) Authorize temporary storage in excess of the initial 60-day limit for CONUS shipments or 90-day limit for OCONUS shipments; and

(i) Ensure pre-payment audits are completed.

####### § 302-7.401 What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment and temporary storage of HHG?

There are two methods of arranging and paying for shipment of HHG and providing for temporary storage: actual expense and commuted rate. You must authorize actual expense or commuted rate, depending on which is less costly to the Government. You must then specify the selected method on the relocation travel authorization.

(a)Under the actual expense method, the Government assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for the actual expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used for all shipments to/from/between OCONUS, and within CONUS where deemed economical to the Government.

(b)

(1) Under the commuted rate system, the employee assumes total responsibility for arranging and paying for the expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used only for shipments within CONUS, and only where it is less costly to the Government than actual expense. The employee may arrange for shipment with a commercial HHG carrier or may rent self-drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move.

(2) The commuted rate is calculated based on published HHG tariffs applied to the actual weight of the goods being shipped (subject also to the weight limitation in §§ 302&#x2013;7.2 through 302&#x2013;7.5).

(3) If a PBP&E shipment causes the weight of a shipment under the commuted rate method to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, then the actual cost of shipping that excess weight attributed to the PBP&E may be paid as an administrative expense of the agency. In this case, all related transportation arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) associated with shipping this excess weight will be handled and paid for by the agency (§ 302&#x2013;7.5 for the process of determining what will paid for by the agency).

####### § 302-7.402 What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment of PBP&E and UAB?

(a) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's PBP&E only when the weight of the PBP&E causes the employee's shipment to exceed the maximum 18,000 pounds net HHG weight limitation and in accordance with § 302&#x2013;7.403. Preferably, PBP&E should be identified and weighed prior to shipment, so the weight can easily be deducted from the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance. In cases where the weight of the PBP&E causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the PBP&E shipment may be paid for as an administrative expense by you, provided you authorized PBP&E.

(b) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's UAB. UAB should be identified, weighed, and shipped prior to shipment of HHG. In cases where the weight of the UAB causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the cost of the excess weight is the responsibility of the employee. Under the actual expense method of shipment, you are responsible for paying the bill of lading in full and then collecting any excess cost from the employee.

####### § 302-7.403 What guidelines must we follow when authorizing transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense?

You have the sole discretion to authorize transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense and may do so provided that:

(a) The authorizing official has certified that the PBP&E is necessary for performance of the employee's duties at the new duty station;

(b) The authorizing official has certified that, if these items were not transported, the same or similar items would have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's use at the new official station;

(c) You have acquired evidence that transporting the PBP&E would cause the employees' HHG to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance; and

(d) If you have requested it, the employee has provided reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E and the weight of the PBP&E for review by the authorizing official (who is usually an official at the employee's new official station).

####### § 302-7.404 Are separate weight certificates required when HHG are shipped under the actual expense method and PBP&E are shipped as an administrative expense in the same lot?

Yes, separate weight certificates are required when the PBP&E and its packing allowance pushes the shipment over the net weight allowance. Otherwise, for administrative efficiency, the HHG shipment should be billed and paid for as a single shipment. If separate weight certificates are required, then the weight of PBP&E and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be listed as separate items on the bill of lading or other shipping document.

####### § 302-7.405 How must we arrange and pay for transportation of HHG and UAB, if we have authorized actual expense for transportation?

When arranging transportation of HHG and UAB under the actual expense method, you should:

(a) Determine the constructive cost of transporting the HHG plus the UAB, as follows:

(1) Compute the cost of transporting the HHG (not including the UAB) in one lot, by the most economical means; be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.

(2) Compute the cost of transporting the UAB.

(3) If the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then compute the cost of transporting only the net weight allowance as one shipment; again, be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.

(4) The constructive cost is either that described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, depending on whether the weight of the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the net weight allowance.

(b) Limit the employee's HHG plus UAB transportation payment to the constructive cost as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, so long as it is equal to or less than the 18,000 pound net limit of this Chapter;

(c) Make arrangements for transporting the employee's HHG and UAB under two separate bills of lading, with direct payment by the agency for both; and

(d) Advise employees of this relocation entitlement limitation and its potential to result in out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. That is, advise employees that they will have to use their personal funds to pay for transporting HHG (including UAB) in excess of 18,000 pounds net weight allowance.

##### PART 302-8 - ALLOWANCES FOR EXTENDED STORAGE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS (HHG)

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 302-8.1 When may extended storage of HHG be authorized?

Your agency may authorize extended storage of HHG under the following circumstances:

(a) Extended storage of HHG may be authorized in lieu of shipment when:

(1) You are assigned to an isolated duty station within CONUS (see subpart B of this part);

(2) You are assigned to an overseas official station where your agency limits the amount of HHG you may transport to that location;

(3) You are assigned to an OCONUS official station and your agency determines extended storage is in the public interest or cost effective to do so; or

(4) It is necessary for a temporary change of station (TCS).

(b) Extended storage of HHG is not permitted for a career SES employee eligible for last move home benefits.

####### § 302-8.2 What is the purpose of extended storage?

The purpose of extended storage is to assist in protecting personal items when you are:

Your agency will indicate on your travel authorization the specific allowances you are authorized as provided in this chapter.

####### § 302-8.4 May I receive an advance of funds for storage allowances covered by this part?

No, an advance of funds is not allowed for storage allowances of HHG.

###### Subpart B - Extended Storage During Assignment to Isolated Locations in the Continental United States (CONUS)

####### § 302-8.100 What is the policy for extended storage of HHG during assignment to isolated locations in CONUS?

Extended storage of HHG belonging to an employee transferred or a new appointee assigned to an official station at an isolated location in CONUS may be allowed only when it is clearly justified under the conditions in this part and is not primarily for the convenience, or at the request of, the employee or the new appointee.

####### § 302-8.101 What are the criteria for determining whether an official station is an isolated official station for purposes of this part?

(a) As determined by your agency, an official station at an isolated location is a place of permanent duty assignment in CONUS at which you have no alternative except to live where you are unable to use your HHG because:

(1) The type of quarters you are required to occupy at the isolated official station will not accommodate your HHG; or

(2) Residence quarters which would accommodate your HHG are not available within reasonable daily commuting distance of the official station.

(b) The designation of an official station as isolated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude a determination in individual instances that adequate housing is available for some employees stationed there based on housing which may be available within daily commuting distance and the size and other characteristics of each employee's immediate family. In such instances the station shall not be considered isolated with regard to you if your agency determines adequate family housing is available for you.

####### § 302-8.102 Am I eligible for extended storage of HHG and personal effects?

(a) Your agency will conduct periodic reviews to determine whether current housing conditions at your isolated official station warrant continuation of storage;

(b) Eligibility for extended storage at Government expense will terminate on your last day of active duty at the isolated official station. However your HHG may remain in temporary storage for an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days, if approved by your agency.

(c) When eligibility ceases, storage at Government expense may continue until the beginning of the second month after the month in which your tour at the official station OCONUS terminates, unless to avoid inequity your agency extends the period.

###### Subpart C - Extended Storage During Assignment Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS)

####### § 302-8.200 Am I eligible for extended storage during assignment OCONUS?

Yes, you are eligible for extended storage during assignment OCONUS if your agency authorizes it, and if:

(a) The official station is one to which you are not authorized to take, or at which you are unable to use, your HHG; or

Yes, you may require that employees participate in counseling before listing their homes, provided this is written into your agency's relocation policy. This is a common practice in the private sector. Please note, however, that this may exclude from your homesale program any employee who lists his/her home before the relocation travel authorization is approved. If you choose to make this part of your agency policy, you should make a major, ongoing effort to inform as many of your potential transferees as possible of this policy.

####### § 302-12.110 [Reserved]

####### § 302-12.111 May we require an employee to use a real estate broker specified by the RSC?

Yes, you may require, through your contract with the RSC, that every employee enrolled in the homesale program use a real estate broker specified by the RSC. This provision is not part of the standard terms for a homesale program, but it may provide a pricing advantage in negotiations with potential RSC, as well as an opportunity for better management of the homesale process.

####### § 302-12.112 May we require an employee to use a mortgage service provider specified by the RSC?

No. Under the Real Estate Procedures Settlement Act (RESPA), you may not require that the employee obtain any mortgage from a lender specified by the RSC. The RSC may provide the employee access to multiple mortgage service providers as long as there is no use requirement, and the employee is provided a choice. Allowing the RSC to provide access to multiple providers is not part of the standard terms for a homesale program, but it may provide a pricing advantage in negotiations with potential RSCs, as well as an opportunity for better management of the homesale process.

####### § 302-12.113 What must we do when planning, establishing, and administering a RSC contract?

(a) When planning and establishing a RSC contract, you must structure the contract so that it provides the best possible value to the Government, considering costs, tax implications, morale, mobility, employee choice, productivity, and any other relevant considerations. For most agencies and most relocations, this structure will include the possibility of a BVO sale or an amended value sale.

(b) Once you have a RSC contract, you must monitor costs and tax consequences and make adjustments as necessary, to ensure that your homesale program continues to provide the same best value to the Government.

####### § 302-12.114 What policies must we establish when offering our employees the services of a RSC?

If you choose to offer the services of a RSC to your employees, you must establish policies governing:

(a) The conditions under which you will authorize an employee to use the contract with the RSC;

(b) Which employees you will allow to use the contract with the RSC;

(c) Which services the RSC will provide to the employee;

(d) Who will determine in each case if an employee may use the contract with the RSC and which services the RSC will provide;

(e) How you will monitor and evaluate the counseling provided by you and/or the RSC to your employees; and

(f) How you will monitor and maintain an appropriate balance between the three types of homesale transactions in your homesale programs (appraised value, buyer value option, and amended value).

####### § 302-12.115 What are the income tax consequences that we must consider when offering relocation services?

Amounts you pay to a relocation services company on behalf of an employee may be taxable to the employee. In some cases, such as certain homesale programs, the amounts may not be taxable. You must determine the taxability of such payments, and pay a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance in accordance with part 302&#x2013;17 of this chapter on payments you determine to be taxable to the employee. You may contact the: Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 5501, Washington, DC 20224, for information on the income tax consequences of payments you make to a relocation services company.

####### § 302-12.116 What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?

You must consider the following factors in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method:

(a)Under a fixed fee contract, the relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if a residence does not sell immediately, while under a cost-reimbursable homesale program you assume some or all risks of selling the residence.

(b)Under the fixed fee method of contracting, the fee includes a cost component for risks assumed by the relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.

(c)You must obligate funds for a relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of computing fund obligation estimates.

####### § 302-12.117 May we take title to an employee's residence?

No, you may not take title to an employee's residence except as specifically provided by statute. The statutes which form the basis for the provisions of this part do not provide such authority.

####### § 302-12.118 Under a homesale program, may we establish a maximum home value above which we will not pay for homesale services?

Yes, if a home exceeding the maximum value above which you will not pay is sold under your homesale program, the employee will be responsible for any additional costs. You must establish a maximum amount commensurate with your agency's experience. You may consider, among other factors, budgetary constraints, the value range of homes in areas where you have offices, and the value range of homes previously entered in your program.

####### § 302-12.119 Under a homesale program, may we pay an employee for losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence?

No, under a home sale program, you may not pay an employee for losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence, but this does not preclude you reimbursing a relocation service's company for losses incurred while the contractor holds the property.

####### § 302-12.120 Under a homesale program, may we direct the relocation services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value of his/her residence?

No, under a homesale program, you may not direct the relocation services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value (as determined by the residence appraisal process) of his/her home.

####### § 302-12.121 May we use a relocation services contract for services which we are contractually bound to obtain under another travel services contract?

No, you may not use a relocation services contract to which you are contractually bound to obtain the services of another relocation service provider or to circumvent the travel and transportation expense payment system contract if you are a user of that contract.

##### PART 302-14 - HOME MARKETING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

###### Subpart A - Payment of Incentive to the Employee

####### § 302-14.1 What is a “homesale program'?

A “homesale program” is a program offered by an agency through a contractual arrangement with a relocation services company. The relocation services company purchases a transferred employee's residence at fair market (appraised) value and then independently markets and sells the residence.

####### § 302-14.2 What is the purpose of a home marketing incentive payment?

The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment is to reduce the Government's relocation costs by encouraging transferred employees to participate in their employing agency's homesale program to independently and aggressively market, and find a bona fide buyer for their residence. This significantly reduces the fees/expenses their agencies must pay to relocation services companies and effectively lowers the cost of such programs.

####### § 302-14.3 Am I eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment?

Yes, you are eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer and you otherwise meet requirements for sale of your residence at Government expense.

####### § 302-14.4 Must my agency pay me a home marketing incentive?

No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest to offer you a home marketing incentive.

####### § 302-14.5 Under what circumstances will I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

You will receive a home marketing incentive payment when:

(a) You enter your residence in your agency's homesale program;

(b) You independently and aggressively market your residence;

(c) You find a bona fide buyer for your residence as a result of your independent marketing efforts;

(d) You transfer the residence to the relocation services company;

(e) Your agency pays a reduced fee/expenses to the relocation services company as a result of your independent marketing efforts;

(f) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established, including but not limited to, mandatory marketing periods, list price guidelines, closing requirements, and residence value caps; and

(g) Your agency has established a home marketing incentive program.

####### § 302-14.6 How much may my agency pay me for a home marketing incentive?

Your agency will determine the amount of your home marketing incentive payment. The incentive payment, however, may not exceed the lesser of:

(a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid when it purchased the residence from you; or

(b) The savings your agency realized from the reduced fee/expenses it paid as a result of you finding a bona fide buyer.

####### § 302-14.7 Are there tax consequences when I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

Yes, the home marketing incentive payment is considered income. Consequently, you will be taxed, and your agency will withhold income and employment taxes, on the home marketing incentive payment. You will not, however, receive a withholding tax allowance (WTA) to offset the withholding on your home marketing incentive payment, nor will you receive a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance payment for substantially all of your Federal, state and local income taxes on the incentive payment.

###### Subpart B - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-14.100 How should we administer our home marketing incentive payment program?

Your goal in using an incentive payment program is to reduce your overall relocation costs. You must not make a home marketing incentive payment that exceeds the savings you realize from the reduced fees/expenses you pay the relocation services company.

####### § 302-14.101 What policies must we establish to govern our home marketing incentive payment program?

You must establish policies to govern:

(a) The conditions under which you will authorize a home marketing incentive payment for an employee;

(b) The amount of the home marketing incentive payment(s) you will offer (or) the method you will use to compute your home marketing incentive payments); and

(c) Who will determine in each case whether a home marketing incentive payment is authorized.

####### § 302-14.102 What factors should we consider in determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program?

In determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program, you should consider:

(a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to you. If your historical percentage of employee-generated sales is below your benchmark, a home marketing incentive payment program may benefit you; and

(b) The expected net savings from a home marketing incentive payment program.

####### § 302-14.103 What factors should we consider in determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment?

In determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment, you should consider the:

(a) Amount of savings from reduced fee/expenses paid to the relocation services company. The home marketing incentive payment program is intended to reduce your relocation costs. The amount of each home marketing incentive payment you make, therefore, must not exceed the savings you realize from the reduced fee you pay to the relocation services company; and

(b) Employee's efforts in marketing the residence. The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment program is to encourage a transferred employee who participates in a homesale program to independently and aggressively market his/her residence and find a bona fide buyer.

##### PART 302-15 - ALLOWANCE FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES

###### Subpart A - General Rules for the Employee

####### § 302-15.1 What are property management services?

“Property management services” are programs provided by private companies for a fee, which help an employee to manage his/her residence at the old official station as a rental property. These services typically include, but are not limited to, obtaining a tenant, negotiating the lease, inspecting the property regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from rental proceeds and/or funds of the employee, and accounting for the transactions and providing periodic reports to the employee.

####### § 302-15.2 What are the purposes of the property management services allowance?

The purposes of the property management services allowance are to:

(a) Reduce overall Government relocation costs by using the property management services allowance in place of allowances for the sale of the employee's residence; and

(b) Relieve employees transferred to OCONUS duty stations from the costs of maintaining a home in CONUS during their tour of duty.

####### § 302-15.3 Am I eligible for payment for property management services under this part?

Yes, you are eligible for payment for property management services when:

(a) You transfer in the interest of the Government; and

(b) You and/or a member(s) of your immediate family hold(s) title to a residence which you are eligible to sell at Government expense under part 302&#x2013;11 or part 302&#x2013;12 of this chapter.

####### § 302-15.4 Who is not eligible for payment for property management services?

New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees transferring wholly outside the United States are not eligible for payment for property management services. However, relocations wholly outside the United States do not affect previously authorized property management services as long as the employee continues to meet the requirements of § 302&#x2013;15.6 and any other conditions established by the agency.

####### § 302-15.5 Is my agency required to authorize payment for property management services?

No, your agency is not required to authorize payment for property management services. However, your agency determines:

(a) When you meet the conditions set forth in § 302&#x2013;15.3;

(b) When to authorize payment for these services; and

(c) What procedures you must follow when it authorizes such payment.

####### § 302-15.6 Under what circumstances may my agency authorize payment under this part?

(a) For a relocation to an official station in the United States, your agency may authorize payment under this part when:

(1) You are being returned from a foreign area post of duty to a different official station than the one from which you were transferred for your foreign tour of duty;

(2) Your agency has determined that property management services is more advantageous and cost effective for the Government than having to sell your residence;

(3) You have signed a service agreements; and

(4) You meet any additional conditions that your agency has established.

(b) For relocations to official stations outside the United States, your agency will authorize payment under this part when you meet conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section.

####### § 302-15.7 For what property may my agency authorize payment under this part?

Under this part, payment may be authorized only for your residence at the last official station in the United States from which you transferred.

####### § 302-15.8 When my agency authorizes payment for me under this part, am I obligated to use such services, or may I elect instead to sell my residence at Government expense?

You are not obligated to use your authorized property management services allowance. You have the option of choosing to sell your residence at Government expense or to use the property management services allowance.

####### § 302-15.9 Must I repay property management expenses my agency paid under this part if I elect to sell my former residence in the United States at Government expense when I am transferred from my current foreign post of duty to an official station in the United States other than the one I left?

No, you are not required to repay any property management expenses paid by your agency if you elect to sell your former residence in the United States when transferred from your post of duty to an official station in the United States. The authority for your agency to pay for property management services under this part when you are transferred to a foreign post of duty arises from your transfer to the foreign post of duty. It is separate from, and in addition to, the authority to sell your residence at Government expense when you are transferred to an official station in the United States other than the official station from which you were transferred to the foreign post of duty.

####### § 302-15.10 How long may my agency pay under this part?

Your agency may pay:

(a) For transfers within the United States for a period not to exceed one year from your effective date of transfer, with up to a 1-year extension, under the same conditions required in § 302&#x2013;11.21 of this chapter; or

(b) From the time you transfer to a foreign area post of duty until you:

(1) Transfer back to an official station in the United States; or

(2) Complete a service agreement at your post of duty and remain there, but do not sign a new service agreement; or

(3) Separate from Government service.

####### § 302-15.11 If my agency authorized, and I elected to receive, payment for property management expenses, may I later elect to sell my residence at Government expense?

Yes, you may change your selection from receiving property management expenses to selling your residence at Government expense provided:

(a) Your agency allows you to change your election of payment from property management expenses to the sale of your residence at Government expense; and

(b) Payment for sale of your residence at Government expense is offset in accordance with your agency's policy established under § 302&#x2013;15.70(d).

####### § 302-15.12 If my agency is paying for property management services under this part and my service agreement expires, what must I do to ensure that payment for property management services continues?

You must sign a new service agreement (see § 302&#x2013;2.14 of this chapter) to continue to this benefit.

####### § 302-15.13 What are the income tax consequences when my agency pays for my property management services?

When your agency pays for your property management services, you will be taxed on the amount of expenses your agency pays for property management services whether it reimburses you directly or whether it pays a relocation services company to manage your residence. Your agency must pay you a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance for the additional Federal, State and local income taxes you incur on property management expenses it reimburses you or pays on your behalf.

###### Subpart B - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-15.70 What governing policies must we establish for the allowance for property management services?

You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) When you will authorize payment for property management services for an employee who transfers in the interest of the Government;

(b) When it is appropriate to authorize this service on a reimbursable basis to the employee, rather than paying the property management company directly, as long as any reimbursement is equal to or less than the agency negotiated rate for this service (agencies may require that employees hire only licensed and/or certified property managers).

(c) Who will determine, for relocations to official duty stations in the United States, whether payment for property management services is more advantageous and cost effective than sale of an employee's residence at Government expense;

(d) If and when you will allow an employee who was offered and accepted payment for property management services to change his/her residence at Government expense in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; and

(e) How you will offset expenses you have paid for property management services against payable expenses for sale of the employee's residence when an eligible employee who elected payment for property management services later changes his/her mind and elects instead to sell his/her residence at Government expense.

#### Subchapter F - Miscellaneous Allowances

(a) Either $650 or the equivalent of one week's basic gross pay, whichever is the lesser amount, if you have no immediate family relocating with you; or

(b) $1,300 or the equivalent of two weeks' basic gross pay, whichever is the lesser amount, if you have immediate family members relocating with you.

####### § 302-16.103 May I claim an amount in excess of that prescribed in § 302-16.102?

Yes, you may claim an amount in excess of that prescribed in § 302&#x2013;16.12 if authorized by your agency; and

####### § 302-16.105 What standard of care must I use in incurring miscellaneous expenses?

You must exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if relocating at personal expense.

###### Subpart C - Agency Responsibilities

##### PART 302-17 - TAXES ON RELOCATION EXPENSES

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 302-17.1 What special terms apply to this part?

The following definitions apply to this part:

means

(1) Money paid to the employee to cover future expenses, such as the miscellaneous expense(see part 302&#x2013;16 of this chapter for information about the miscellaneous expense);

(2) Money paid to the employee to cover past expenses, such as the relocation income tax(RITA) under the two-year tax process described in part 302&#x2013;17, subpart G; or

(3) A limit established by statute or regulation, such as the 18,000 pound net weightfor household goods shipments (see part 302&#x2013;7 of this chapter for information about the 18,000 pound net weight).

means any unit of general local government as defined in 31 CFR 215.2(b).

means a single rate determined by combining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal, state, and local income taxes, using the formula provided in § 302&#x2013;17.40. (If you incur liability for income tax in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, see § 302&#x2013;17.44.)

means any unit of local general government as defined in 31 CFR 215.2(e).

used as a noun in this part means:

(1) The process that your agency uses to estimate the additional income tax liability that you incur as a result of relocation benefits and taxes on those benefits; or

(2) The result of theprocess.

means Title 26 of the United States Code, which governs Federal income taxes.

means a tax imposed by a recognized city or county tax authority that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as aunder the IRC, at 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3). (See the definitions for the termsandin this section.)

means the tax rate that applies to the last increment of taxable income after taxable relocation benefits have been added to the employee's income. Examples of how to determine the marginal tax rate using the IRS Tax Rate Schedules are published in an FTR bulletin at.

means money paid to you to cover expenses that you have already paid for out of your own funds.

means all reimbursements and allowances that you receive, plus all direct payments that your agency makes on your behalf, in connection with your relocation.

means the payment to individuals to cover the difference between the withholding tax allowance (WTA), if any, and the actual income tax liability incurred by the individual, and such individual's spouse (if filing jointly), as a result of their taxable relocation benefits authorized pursuant to this chapter. RITA is paid whenever the actual income tax liability exceeds the WTA and applies to any travel, transportation, and relocation expenses reimbursed or furnished in kind pursuant to chapter 57, subchapter II of title 5 U.S.C. and 5 U.S.C. chapter 41.

means any one of the several states of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States.

means a tax imposed by a state tax authority that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes under the IRC, specifically 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3).

means the amount paid to the Federal IRS by the agency as withholding of income taxes for any taxable relocation allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.

####### § 302-17.2 Why does relocation affect personal income taxes?

When you are relocated from one permanent duty station to another, you are reimbursed by your employing agency for certain expenses. The IRC requires that you report many of these relocation benefits, including some that your agency pays on your behalf, as taxable income. When you receive taxable benefits, you must pay income tax on the amount or value of those benefits. However, 5 U.S.C. 5724b also requires that your agency reimburse you for substantially all of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes you incur as a result of any taxable relocation benefits. A reimbursement for taxes is also a taxable benefit on which you must pay additional taxes.

####### § 302-17.3 What is the Government's objective in reimbursing the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?

The Government's objective is to reimburse employees or individuals eligible for relocation expense allowances under § 302&#x2013;1.1 of this chapter for substantially all (not exactly all&#x2014;see § 302&#x2013;17.4) of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation, including the taxes on the taxable relocation benefits and the taxes on the reimbursement for taxes.

####### § 302-17.4 Why is the reimbursement for substantially all, and not exactly all, of the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?

Because of the complexity of the calculations, which involve not only Federal income tax but also the income tax rates of many states and localities, it is not reasonable for the Government to compute the exact impact of relocation on an affected employee's taxes. Making a good faith effort to reimburse substantially all additional income taxes is sufficient. The statute where this appears, at 5 U.S.C. 5724b does not define substantially all. This Part provides the description through its provisions.

####### § 302-17.5 Who is eligible for the WTA and the RITA?

The withholding tax allowance (WTA) and the relocation income tax allowance (RITA) are the two allowances through which the Government reimburses you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation. You are eligible for the WTA and the RITA if you are relocating in the interest of the Government, and your agency's reimbursements to you for relocation expenses result in you being liable for additional income taxes. Eligibility for WTA and RITA includes, among others, transferred employees, appointments (new or political), assignments under the Government Employees Training Act, and those returning from an overseas assignment for the purpose of separation from Government service.

####### § 302-17.6 Is there any circumstance under which the WTA and the RITA are not paid even though I would otherwise be eligible?

If you violate the 12-month service agreement under which you are relocated, your agency will not pay the WTA or the RITA to you, and you must repay any relocation benefits paid prior to the violation.

####### § 302-17.7 What limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to various relocation reimbursements?

(a) Some relocation expenses reimbursed to you or paid directly by the Government on or after January 1, 2018, and on or before December 31, 2025, must be reported as income and you cannot claim them as deductible expenses on your Federal tax return.

(b) A table summarizing the FTR allowances, limitations, and tax treatment of each reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a service provider or vendor is published atThe table also cites relevant FTR paragraphs for details. GSA will revise the table to reflect any changes as quickly as possible; however, users of this part may wish to consult with a tax advisor to determine what limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to your relocation reimbursement(s).

####### § 302-17.8 Who is responsible for knowing which relocation expenses are taxable and which expenses are nontaxable?

Both you and your agency must know which reimbursements and direct payments to vendors are taxable and which are nontaxable in your specific circumstances. When you submit a voucher for reimbursement, your agency must determine whether the reimbursement is taxable income at the Federal, state, and/or local level. Then, when you file your income tax returns, you must report the taxable allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors as income. Your agency is ultimately responsible for calculating and reporting withholding accurately and you are ultimately responsible for filing your taxes correctly.

####### § 302-17.9 Which expenses should I report on my state tax returns if I am required to file returns in two different states?

In most cases, your state tax return for the state you are leaving should reflect your reimbursement or allowance, if any, for househunting expenses and your reimbursement or direct payments to vendors for real estate expenses at the home you are leaving. All other taxable expenses should be shown as income on the tax return you file in the state into which you have moved. However, you and your agency must carefully study the rules in both states and include everything that each state considers to be income on each of your state tax returns.

####### § 302-17.10 When is an expense considered completed in a specific tax year?

A reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor is considered completed in a specific tax year only if the money was actually disbursed to the employee or vendor during the tax year in question.

####### § 302-17.11 Where can I find additional information and guidance on WTA and RITA?

GSA has published additional information on WTA and RITA, including the illustrations and examples of various RITA computations, in FTR Bulletins which are updated as necessary. GSA FTR Bulletins may be found at.

####### § 302-17.12 How are taxes on extended TDY benefits and taxes on relocation allowances related?

(a) Taxes on extended TDY benefits are computed using exactly the same processes described in this Part for the WTA and RITA except that:

(1) The tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “withholding tax allowance” (WTA) in exactly the same fashion as the process for taxes on relocation allowances; however, in place of the term “relocation income tax allowance,” the tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “extended TDY tax reimbursement allowance” (ETTRA); and

(2) All benefits are taxable under extended TDY, so the sections of this Part that discuss which benefits are taxable and which are not have no relevance to ETTRA.

(b) See part 301&#x2013;11, subpart F of this title for additional information about taxes on extended TDY benefits.

###### Subpart B - The Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA)

####### § 302-17.20 What is the purpose of the WTA?

The purpose of the WTA is to protect you from having to use part of your relocation expense reimbursements to pay Federal income tax withholding; it does not cover state taxes, local taxes, Medicare taxes, or Social Security taxes (see § 302&#x2013;17.22(c) and (d)).

####### § 302-17.21 What relocation expenses does the WTA cover?

The WTA covers certain allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors, to the extent that each of them is taxable income. In particular, the WTA covers:

(a) En route lodging, meals and incidental expenses&#x2014;Reimbursements for lodging, meals and incidental expenses while en route to the new official station for you and your immediate family member(s). (See part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter).

(b) Transportation&#x2014;Transportation expenses, to include commercial air or privately owned vehicle, for you and your immediate family member(s) transferred between official stations. (See part 302&#x2013;4 of this chapter).

(c) Househunting trip&#x2014;Travel (including per diem and transportation) expenses for you and/or your spouse for a round trip to the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters. Househunting is covered regardless of whether reimbursed under the per diem allowance or lump sum method. (See part 302&#x2013;5 of this chapter).

(d) Temporary quarters&#x2014;Subsistence expenses for you and your immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters at the old or new official station. Temporary quarters are covered regardless of whether reimbursed under the actual expense or lump sum method. (See part 302&#x2013;6 of this chapter).

(e) Transportation and temporary storage of personal property&#x2014;Transportation and temporary storage of household goods (HHG) and at Government expense for employees who transferred between official stations. (See part 302&#x2013;7 of this chapter).

(f) Extended storage&#x2014;Extended storage of household goods for a temporary change of station in CONUS or assignment to an isolated duty station in CONUS. (See part 302&#x2013;8 of this chapter).

(g) Transportation of privately owned vehicle&#x2014;Transportation of a privately owned vehicle at Government expense for employees who transferred between official stations in CONUS. (See part 302&#x2013;9 of this chapter).

(h) Transportation of mobile homes and boats used as a primary residence&#x2014;Expenses for transportation of a mobile home or boat in lieu of transportation of household goods to the new official station. (See part 302&#x2013;10 of this chapter).

(i) Real estate&#x2014;Expenses for the sale of the residence at your old official station and/or purchase of a home at your new official station, when reimbursement is made directly to you. This can also include expenses for settling an unexpired lease (“breaking” a lease) at your old official station. (See part 302&#x2013;11 of this chapter. If you or a member of your immediate family do not hold full title to the home you are selling or buying, see § 302&#x2013;11.103 of this chapter).

(j) Relocation services company&#x2014;Expenses paid by a relocation services company to the extent such payments constitute taxable income to the employee. The extent to which such payments constitute taxable income varies according to the individual circumstances of your relocation, and by the state and locality in which you reside. (See appropriate state and local tax authorities for additional information). (See also part 302&#x2013;12 of this chapter).

(k) Property Management Services&#x2014;Payment for the services of a property manager for renting rather than selling a residence at your old official station. (See part 302&#x2013;15 of this chapter).

(l) Miscellaneous expense allowance&#x2014;Miscellaneous expenses for defraying certain relocation expenses not covered by other relocation benefits. (See part 302&#x2013;16 of this chapter).

####### § 302-17.22 What relocation expenses does the WTA not cover?

The WTA does not cover the following relocation expenses:

(a) Any reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor that should not be reported as taxable income when you file your Federal tax return; this includes but is not limited to expenses for transportation of POVs for OCONUS assignments.

(b) Reimbursed expenses for extended storage of household goods during an OCONUS assignment, if reimbursement is permitted under your agency's policy.

(c) State and local withholding tax obligations. To the extent that your state or local tax authority requires periodic (such as quarterly) tax payments, you are responsible to pay these from your own funds. Your agency reimburses you for substantially all of these payments through the RITA process, but your agency does not provide a WTA for them. If required to by state or local law, your agency may withhold these from your reimbursement.

(d) Additional taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act including Social Security tax, if applicable, and Medicare tax. Current law does not allow Federal agencies to reimburse transferees for these employment taxes on relocation benefits. However, your agency will deduct for these taxes from your reimbursements for taxable items.

(e) Home marketing incentive payment. In accordance with FTR part 302&#x2013;14, your agency may not provide you either a WTA or RITA for this incentive.

(f) Any recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive payment that you receive. Any withholding of taxes for such payments is outside the scope of this regulation. Rather, it is covered by regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management, Treasury's Financial Management Service, and the IRS.

(g) Any allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors not related to your relocation; for example, a reimbursement for office supplies would not be covered by the WTA, even if it occurred during your relocation.

####### § 302-17.23 What are the procedures for my WTA?

(a) Your agency prepares a relocation travel authorization, which includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate funds for your relocation.

(b) Your agency pays certain allowances to you. Your agency also pays vendors directly for other relocation expenses.

(c) Your agency instructs you as to whether to submit one voucher after you have completed your relocation or to submit vouchers at various points as your relocation progresses plus another when your relocation is completed.

(d) You submit your voucher(s) for reimbursement of certain relocation expenses.

(e) Your agency determines the extent to which each allowance, each item on your voucher(s), and each direct payment to a vendor is nontaxable or is taxable income to you under the IRC.

(f) For the taxable items, your agency calculates your WTA and any reimbursement(s) due to you in accordance with § 302&#x2013;17.24. Your agency sets aside the amount of your WTA and pays the IRS as a withholding tax in accordance with IRS requirements.

####### § 302-17.24 How does my agency compute my WTA?

Each time your agency pays a covered, taxable relocation expense, regardless of whether it is a reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor, it is considered “supplemental wages” as defined in 26 CFR 31.3402(g)&#x2013;1(a) (see also IRS Publication 15, Employer's Tax Guide). You owe taxes on the WTA itself because, like most other relocation allowances, it is taxable income. To reimburse you for the taxes on the WTA itself, your agency computes the WTA by using the grossed-up withholding formula below and the appropriate supplemental wage rate, as specified in IRS Publication 15. This rate, along with examples of how to calculate the WTA, is published in an FTR bulletin available at. The formula for calculating the WTA is:

Where R is the withholding rate for supplemental wages.

###### Subpart C - The Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA)

####### § 302-17.30 What is the purpose of the RITA?

(a) The purpose of the RITA is to reimburse you for any taxes that you owe that were not adequately reimbursed by the WTA. As discussed in § 302&#x2013;17.24, the WTA calculation is based on the income tax withholding rate applicable to supplemental wages. This may be higher or lower than your actual tax rate. The RITA, on the other hand, is based on your marginal tax rate, determined by your actual taxable income and filing status, which allows your agency to reimburse you forof your Federal income taxes. The RITA also reimburses you for any additional state and local taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation, because they are not reimbursed in the WTA process.

(b) The WTA may be optional to you. See § 302&#x2013;17.61 for a discussion of criteria for choosing whether or not to accept the WTA. See §§ 302&#x2013;17.62 through 302&#x2013;17.69 for procedures if you choose not to accept the WTA.

####### § 302-17.31 What are the procedures for calculation and payment of my RITA?

The procedures for the calculation and payment of your RITA depend on whether your agency has chosen to use a one-year or two-year RITA process. See Subpart F for the one-year process and Subpart G for the two-year process.

####### § 302-17.32 Who chooses the one-year or two-year process?

Your agency or a major component of your agency determines whether it will adopt a one-year or two-year RITA process. Your agency may use the one-year RITA process for one or more specific categories of employees and the two-year process for one or more other categories.

####### § 302-17.33 May I ask my agency to recalculate my RITA?

(a) Yes, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA provided you filed your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” and amended it, if necessary, in a timely manner. If, once you have completed all Federal, state, and local tax returns, you believe that your RITA should have been significantly different from the RITA that your agency calculated, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA. This is true for either the one-year or two-year process. With any request for recalculation, you must submit a statement explaining why you believe your RITA was incorrect.

(b) Please note that your agency may require that you also submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” (if, for example, you inadvertently did not report some of your income in your original Statement), your actual tax returns, or both, as attachments to your request for recalculation.

###### Subpart D - The Combined Marginal Tax Rate (CMTR)

####### § 302-17.40 How does my agency calculate my CMTR?

(a) The CMTR is a key element that greatly enhances the accuracy of the calculation of your RITA. Your agency uses the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as amended, to determine your CMTR, as follows (see subparts F and G of this part for information about the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).

(b) The CMTR is, in essence, a combination of your Federal, state, and local tax rates. However, the CMTR cannot be calculated by merely adding the Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates together because of the deductibility of state and local income taxes from income on your Federal income tax return. The formula prescribed below for calculating the CMTR, therefore, is designed to adjust the state and local tax rates to compensate for their deductibility from income for Federal tax purposes. Examples of how to calculate the CMTR are published in an FTR bulletin available at.

(c) The formula for calculating the CMTR is:

(d) Your agency finds the Federal marginal tax rate by comparing your taxable income, as shown in your “Statement of Income and Filing Status,” to the Federal tax tables in the current year's Form 1040&#x2013;ES instructions (see §§ 302&#x2013;17.50&#x2014;302&#x2013;17.53 and §§ 302&#x2013;17.63&#x2014;302&#x2013;17.65 for additional information on the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).

(e) Your agency finds the state and local marginal tax rates that apply to you (if any) by comparing your taxable income to the most current state and/or local tax tables provided by the states and localities. Every Federal payroll office and every provider of tax calculation software has these tables readily available, and the tables are also available on the Web sites of the various state and local taxing authorities.

####### § 302-17.41 Is there any difference in the procedures for calculating the CMTR, depending on whether my agency chooses the one-year or two-year RITA process?

No. The procedures for calculating the CMTR are the same for the one-year and two-year RITA processes.

####### § 302-17.42 Which state marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use to calculate the CMTR if I incur tax liability in more than one state, and how does this affect my RITA and my state tax return(s)?

If two or more states that are involved in your relocation impose an income tax on relocation benefits, then your relocation benefits may be taxed by both states. Most commonly, your old and new duty stations are in the two states involved. The following table lays out the possibilities:

####### § 302-17.43 What local marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use?

(a) If you incur local tax liability, you provide the applicable marginal tax rate(s) on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”. Your agency validates the applicable local marginal tax rate(s) and uses it (them) in the CMTR formula.

(b) If you incur local income tax liability in more than one locality, then your agency should follow the rules described for state income taxes in § 302&#x2013;17.42 to calculate the local marginal tax rate that will be used in the CMTR formula and to compute your RITA, and you should follow the rules in § 302&#x2013;17.42 to determine your actions.

(c) If a locality in which you incur income tax liability publishes its tax rates in terms of a percentage of your Federal or state taxes, then your agency must convert that tax rate to a percentage of your income to use it in computing your CMTR. This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal or state tax rate by the applicable local tax rate. For example, if the state marginal tax rate is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50 percent of state income tax liability, the local marginal tax rate stated as a percentage of taxable income would be 3 percent.

####### § 302-17.44 What if I incur income tax liability to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico?

A Federal employee who is relocated to or from a point, or between points, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be subject to income tax by both the Federal Government and the government of Puerto Rico. However, under current Puerto Rico law, an employee receives a credit on his/her Puerto Rico income tax for the amount of taxes paid to the Federal Government. Therefore:

(a) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, isthan the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then your agency uses the Federal marginal tax rates and the formula in § 302&#x2013;17.40(c) in calculating your CMTR.

(b) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, isthan the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, and if all of the states involved either have no income tax oran adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the rate for Puerto Rico in place of the Federal marginal tax rate in the formula in § 302&#x2013;17.40(c).

(c) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, isthan the applicable Federal marginal tax rate and one or more of the state(s) involvedan adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and/or Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the formula below:

####### § 302-17.45 What if I incur income tax liability to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any other territory or possession of the United States?

If you are relocated to, from, or within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any territory or possession of the United States that is covered by the definition in § 302&#x2013;17.1, your agency will have to determine the tax rules of that locality and then include those taxes in your RITA calculation, as applicable.

###### Subpart E - Special Procedure If a State Treats an Expense as Taxable Even Though It Is Nontaxable Under the Federal IRC

####### § 302-17.46 What does my agency do if a state treats an expense as taxable even though it is nontaxable under the Federal IRC?

If one or more of the states where you have incurred tax liability for relocation expenses treats one or more relocation expenses as taxable, even though it (they) are nontaxable under Federal tax rules, you may be required to pay additional state income tax when you file tax returns with those states. In this case, your agency calculates a state gross-up to cover the additional tax liability resulting from the covered relocation expense reimbursement(s) that are nontaxable under Federal, but not state tax rules. Your agency calculates the state gross-up and then adds that amount to your RITA. Your agency will use this formula to calculate the state gross-up:

“N” is determined as follows:

1. Take the dollar amount of reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors treated as nontaxable under Federal tax rules.

2. Subtract the dollar amount of reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors treated as nontaxable by the state.

3. The difference represents “N.”

###### Subpart F - The One-Year RITA Process

####### § 302-17.50 What information should I provide to my agency to make the RITA calculation possible under the one-year process?

You should provide the information required in the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” as follows:

####### § 302-17.51 When should I file my “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” under the one-year process?

For the one-year process, you should file this form as soon as you receive your relocation orders, or as soon as you file your tax returns for the most recent tax year, whichever occurs later.

####### § 302-17.52 When should I file an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” under the one-year process?

You should submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” to your agency under the one-year process whenever the information on it changes, and you should continue to amend it until you have received the last W&#x2013;2 from your agency in connection with a specific relocation. In particular, you should file an amended version of this statement whenever:

(a) Your filing status changes;

(b) Your income changes enough that your income, including WTA and RITA, might put you into a different tax bracket; or

(c) You have taxable relocation expenses in a second or third calendar year.

####### § 302-17.53 What happens if I do not file and amend the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner?

If you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and/or amend it when necessary, your agency will switch to the 2-year process, and because the WTA is an advance of your income tax expenses, you will be liable to repay the full amount of the WTA that your agency has paid to the IRS. See subpart G of this part.

####### § 302-17.54 How does my agency calculate my RITA under the one-year process?

(a) Your agency provides allowances to you, reimburses you for vouchers that you submit, and pays certain relocation vendors directly, all during the calendar year as described in subpart B of this part. Some of these reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable income to you, the employee, as described in subpart A of this part. Your agency computes a WTA and reports the WTA to the IRS as taxes withheld for you for each of these taxable reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors. The WTA may be optional to you. However, if your agency is using a one-year RITA process, there is no advantage to you in choosing not to receive the WTA, because your agency will adjust the WTA payment to the IRS. See § 302&#x2013;17.55(a)(1).

(b) Your agency establishes a cutoff date (for example, December 1), after which it will not issue reimbursements or allowances to you or make direct payments to relocation vendors for the rest of the calendar year.

(c) If the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” changes after you have submitted the initial version, you must submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” no later than your agency's cutoff date.

(d) During the period between the cutoff date and the end of the calendar year, your agency calculates your RITA.

(e) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by using a gross-up formula that multiplies the grossed-up CMTR by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits, and then subtracts your grossed-up WTA from that total. That is:

####### § 302-17.55 What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the one-year process?

(a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA computed and reported during the year, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:

(1) If the calculation above results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as WTA), then your agency will send an adjustment to the IRS using Form 941. In this case, your agency does not make a RITA payment to you because you do not need additional funds to pay your taxes. That is, everything you need to pay substantially all of your taxes was included in the adjusted WTA, and that is the amount that will appear on your Form W&#x2013;2.

(2) If the calculation above results in a positive value (that is if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money for your income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of the calendar year and report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year.

(b) Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency will provide one or two W&#x2013;2 Forms to you. At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W&#x2013;2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA (if any), along with your payroll wages, or you may receive one W&#x2013;2 for your payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.

####### § 302-17.56 What do I do, under the one-year process, once my agency has provided my W-2(s)?

(a) You must use all W&#x2013;2(s) that you have received to file your tax returns. On those returns, you must include all taxable relocation expenses shown on your W&#x2013;2(s) as income, including your WTA and RITA (if any). Please note that you must also include all WTA as withholding, in addition to the standard withholding from your payroll wages.

(b) If you finished your relocation within one calendar year, and your agency paid all of your relocation reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors in the same calendar year, before the cutoff date, then your tax returns for that calendar year are the end of your relocation tax process. If, on the other hand, your agency reimburses you for relocation expenses, or pays allowances or relocation vendors on your behalf, during a second (and possibly a third) calendar year, then you and your agency repeat the process above for each of those years.

###### Subpart G - The Two-Year RITA Process

####### § 302-17.60 How are the terms “Year 1” and “Year 2” used in the two-year RITA process?

(a) Year 1 is the calendar year in which the agency reimburses you for a specific expense, provides an allowance, or pays a vendor directly. If your reimbursements, allowances, and/or direct payments to vendors occur in more than one calendar year, you will have more than one Year 1.

(b) Year 2 is the calendar year in which you submit your RITA claim and your agency pays your RITA to you.

(c) In most cases:

(1) For every Year 1 you will have a corresponding Year 2;

(2) Every Year 2 immediately follows a Year 1; and

(3) Year 2 is the year in which you file a tax return reflecting your remaining tax liability for taxable reimbursement(s), allowance(s), and/or direct payments to vendors in each Year 1.

####### § 302-17.61 Is the WTA optional under the two-year process?

(a) Yes. If your agency makes the WTA optional to you, you may choose to not receive the WTA.

(b) When deciding whether or not to receive the WTA, you should consider the following:

(1) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be equal to or higher than the supplemental wage rate for the calendar year in which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to elect to receive the WTA.

(2) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than the supplemental wage rate for the calendar year in which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to decline receiving the WTA to avoid or limit possible overpayment of the WTA, the so-called “negative RITA” situation. In a “negative RITA” situation, you must repay some of the WTA in Year 2. However, even if your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than the supplemental wage rate, you may want to accept the WTA so that your initial reimbursement is larger.

(3) Examples showing relocation allowances paid by accepting or declining the WTA are published in an FTR bulletin available at.

####### § 302-17.62 What information do I put on my tax returns for Year 1 under the two-year process?

(a) Your agency provides allowances to you, reimburses you for vouchers that you submit, and pays certain relocation vendors directly, all during the same calendar year, as described in subpart B of this part. Some of these reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable income to you, the employee. Your agency computes a WTA and reports that withholding to the IRS for each of these that is taxable. This is Year 1 of the two-year process.

(b) If your agency makes the WTA optional to you and you have chosen not to receive the WTA, then your agency computes withholding tax for each taxable reimbursement, allowance, and direct payment, and reports that withholding to the IRS.

(c) Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency provides one or more W&#x2013;2 forms to you. At its discretion, your agency may include all of your taxable relocation expenses and WTA (if any) in one W&#x2013;2, along with your regular payroll wages, or it may provide you one W&#x2013;2 for your regular payroll wages and a separate W&#x2013;2 for your taxable relocation expenses and WTA (if any).

(d) At approximately the same time as your agency provides your W&#x2013;2(s), it also may provide you an itemized list of all relocation benefits and the WTA (if any) for each benefit. You should use this statement to verify that your agency has included all covered taxable items in its calculations and to check your agency's calculations.

(e) You must submit all W&#x2013;2s that you have received with your Year 1 tax returns. On those returns, you must include all taxable relocation expenses during the previous year as income. Furthermore, you must include the WTA (if any) as tax payments that your agency made for you during the previous year, in addition to the regular withholding of payroll taxes from your salary.

####### § 302-17.63 What information should I provide to my agency to make the RITA calculation possible under the two-year process?

You should provide the information required in the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” shown below. This information should be taken from the income tax returns you filed for Year 1.

####### § 302-17.64 When should I file my “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and RITA claim under the two-year process?

For the two-year process, you should file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in Year 2, along with your RITA claim, after you file your income tax return. If your agency pays any taxable expenses covered by the WTA (if any) in more than one year, then you will have to file a new “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” each year. Your agency establishes the deadline each year for filing of your Statement.

####### § 302-17.65 What happens if I do not file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner?

The WTA is an advance on your income tax expenses, thus if you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner, your agency will require you to repay the entire amount of the withholding and WTA (if any) that the agency has paid on your behalf.

####### § 302-17.66 How do I claim my RITA under the two-year process?

(a) To claim your RITA under the two-year process, you must submit a voucher and attach the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as discussed in §§ 302&#x2013;17.63&#x2013;302&#x2013;17.65.

(b) Your voucher must claim a specific amount. However, your agency will calculate your actual RITA after you submit your RITA voucher and your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status;” the amount you claim on your voucher does not enter into that calculation. You should perform the RITA calculation for yourself, as a check on your agency's calculation, but you are not required to put the “right answer” on the voucher you submit to claim your RITA.

####### § 302-17.67 How does my agency calculate my RITA under the two-year process?

(a) Your agency calculates your RITA after receipt of your RITA voucher.

(b) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by applying the CMTR to the final amount rather than the reimbursed amount.

(c) Thus, your agency calculates your RITA by multiplying the Combined Marginal Tax Rate (CMTR) (using the state and local tax tables most current at the time of the RITA calculation) by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits during the applicable Year 1, and then subtracting your WTA(s), if any, from the same Year 1 from that total. That is:

####### § 302-17.68 What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the two-year process?

(a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA(s) paid during Year 1, if any, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:

(1) If the RITA calculation in § 302&#x2013;17.67 results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as income taxes), then your agency will report this result to you and will send you a bill for the difference, to repay the excess amount that it sent to the IRS on your behalf as withheld income taxes. The IRS will credit you for the full amount of withheld taxes, including the excess amount, when you file your income tax return for Year 1; therefore, you must repay the excess amount to your agency within 90 days, or within a time period set by your agency. If you are required to repay an amount in Year 2 that was included as wages on your W&#x2013;2 in Year 1, you may be entitled to a miscellaneous itemized deduction on your Federal income tax return in Year 2. For more information, see IRS Publication 535, “Business Expenses.” If your agency chooses to offer you the choice, then you may want to decline the WTA to avoid this so-called “negative RITA” situation.

(2) If the RITA calculation in § 302&#x2013;17.67 results in a positive value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money as income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of Year 2 and will report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year. Also, after your agency has paid your RITA to you, it will provide a W&#x2013;2 that shows your RITA as taxable income to you.

(b) At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W&#x2013;2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA (if any), and RITA (if any), along with your regular payroll wages, or you may receive one W&#x2013;2 for your regular payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.

####### § 302-17.69 How do I pay taxes on my RITA under the two-year process?

When income taxes are due for Year 2, you must report your RITA, if any, as taxable income on your Federal, state, and local tax returns.

(a) If your relocation process results in only one Year 2, or if the previous year was your last Year 1, your RITA is the only amount that you report as income resulting from your relocation for that Year 2.

(b) If, on the other hand, your relocation process results in more than one Year 2 (if, for example, you incurred relocation expenses during more than one calendar year), then, except for your last Year 2, you will need to report reimbursements, allowances, direct payments to vendors, and WTA(s), if any, for succeeding Year 1's at the same time that you report each Year 2's RITA.

(c) See the table in § 302&#x2013;17.60 for a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2.

###### Subpart H - Agency Responsibilities

####### § 302-17.100 May we use a relocation services provider to comply with the requirements of this part?

Yes. You may use the services of relocation companies to manage all aspects of relocation, including the RITA computation. Agencies that relocate few employees or do not have the resources to manage the complexity of relocation may find that the use of relocation companies is a practical alternative. As another alternative, agencies with infrequent requirements for relocation or with inadequate internal resources may establish an interagency agreement with one or more other agencies to pool resources to provide this service.

####### § 302-17.101 What are our responsibilities with regard to taxes on relocation expenses?

To ensure that all provisions of this Part are fulfilled, you must:

(a) Prepare a relocation travel authorization that includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate the funds that will be needed.

(b) Determine, in light of the specific circumstances of each employee relocation, which reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable, and which are nontaxable.

(c) Decide whether or not you will allow individual employees and/or categories of employees to choose not to receive the WTA.

(d) Calculate the WTA, and credit the amount of the WTA to the employee at the time of reimbursement.

(e) Prepare the employee's W&#x2013;2 Form(s) and ensure that it (they) reflect(s) the WTA.

(f) Provide each employee an itemized list of relocation expenses after the end of each calendar year in which you provided an allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.

(g) Establish processes for identifying the relevant Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates and for keeping that information current.

(h) Establish processes for identifying states that treat a reimbursement or direct payment to a vendor as taxable even though it is nontaxable under the Federal IRC, and for keeping that information current.

(i) Calculate the employee's CMTR(s).

(j) Decide whether you will use the one-year or two-year RITA process and whether you will use different processes (that is, one-year or two-year) for different groups of employees within your agency.

(k) Make sure the RITA calculation is done correctly and in a timely manner, whether your policies call for the calculation to be done by you or by a third party.

(l) Make sure that payment of the RITA occurs in a timely manner (this is especially critical for the one-year process).

(m) Develop criteria for accepting and rejecting requests for recalculation of RITA.

(n) Establish a process for recalculating the RITA when the employee's request for recalculation is accepted.

(o) Consult with IRS for clarification of any confusion stemming from taxes on relocation expenses.

####### § 302-17.102 What happens if an employee fails to file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date?

(a) If a relocating employee does not file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date, and you are using a one-year RITA process, you are to switch to a two-year RITA process and send a written warning to the employee reminding them of the requirement and informing them that if they do not submit the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” you may declare the entire amount of the WTA forfeited.

(b) If the relocating employee does not file and/or amend a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to the required date, and you are using a two-year RITA process, you are to send the employee a written warning informing them they have 60 days to file or amend their “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” or you will declare the WTA that you have already paid on his/her behalf forfeited and due as a debt to the Government.

(c) If the relocating employee chose not to receive the WTA and fails to file a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to your required date, you are to send the employee a written warning that they have 60 days to file. If the employee still fails to file, you may close your case file and refuse any later claims for RITA related to this specific relocation.

####### § 302-17.103 What are the advantages of choosing a 1-year or a 2-year RITA process?

(a) The one-year process is simpler. It reimburses the employee more quickly, and it eases the administrative burden required to calculate the RITA. Most importantly, the one-year process eliminates the possibility of charging employees for excess payments to the IRS, the so-called “negative RITA.”

(b) The two-year process provides a somewhat more accurate calculation of the additional taxes the employee incurs because it is based on the employee's actual Year One taxable income and filing status rather than the taxable income and filing status from the year before.

###### § 302-17.0 General.

Use of the pronouns “I,” “you,” and their variants throughout this part refer to the employee, unless otherwise noted.

Except as provided in § 304&#x2013;3.13 of this subchapter, your agency must approve acceptance of such payments in advance of your travel.

##### PART 304-2 - DEFINITIONS

###### § 304-2.1 What definitions apply to this chapter?

The following definitions apply to this chapter:

means an appointed officer or employee of an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, including a special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, or an expert or consultant appointed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 3109.

means a conference, seminar, speaking engagement, symposium, training course, or similar event that takes place away from the employee's official station. “Meeting” as defined in this chapter does not include a meeting or other event required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions such as investigations, inspections, audits, site visits, negotiations or litigation. “Meeting” also does not include promotional vendor training or other meetings held for the primary purpose of marketing the non-Federal sources products or services, or long term TDY or training travel. A meeting need not be widely attended for purposes of this definition and includes but is not limited to the following:

(1) An event where the employee will participate as a speaker or panel participant focusing on his/her official duties or on the policies, programs or operations of the agency.

(2) A conference, convention, seminar, symposium or similar event where the primary purpose is to receive training other than promotional vendor training, or to present or exchange substantive information of mutual interest to a number of parties.

(3) An event where the employee will receive an award or honorary degree, which is in recognition of meritorious public service that is related to the employee's official duties, and which may be accepted by the employee consistent with the applicable standards of conduct regulations.

means any person or entity other than the Government of the United States. The term includes any individual, private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or association, international or multinational organization (irrespective of whether an agency holds membership in the organization or association), or foreign, State or local government (including the government of the District of Columbia).

means a monetary payment from a non-Federal source to a Federal agency for travel, subsistence, related expenses by check or other monetary instrument payable to the Federal agency (electronic fund transfer (EFT), money order, charge card, etc.) or payment in kind.

means transportation, food, lodging, or other travel-related services provided by a non-Federal source instead of monetary payments to the Federal agency for these services. Payment in kind also includes waiver or discount of any fees that a non-Federal source collects from meeting attendees (registration fees), but does not include waivers or discounts of an employee's fees on the day(s) they are participating in the meeting or similar function as a speaker, panelist, or presenter.

means the same types of expenses payable under chapter 301 of this title, the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) for transportation, food, lodging or other travel-related services for official travel (e.g., baggage expenses, services of guides, drivers, interpreters, communication services, hire of conference rooms, lodging taxes, laundry/dry cleaning, taxi or TNC fares, or the cost of utilizing an innovative mobility technology company, etc). These expenses also include conference or training fees (in whole or in part), as well as benefits that cannot be paid under the applicable travel regulations, but which are incident to the meeting, provided in kind, and made available by the meeting sponsor(s) to all attendees. For example, this definition as applied to this chapter would allow an employee or spouse to attend a sporting event hosted by the sponsor(s) in connection with the meeting that is available to all participants. However, it would not allow the employee to accept tickets to a professional sporting event, concert or similar event, for use at a later date even if such tickets were given to all other participants.

(a) If your agency has already authorized acceptance of payment for some of your travel expenses for that meeting from a non-Federal source, then you may accept on behalf of your agency, payment for any of your additional travel expenses from the same non-Federal source as long as&#x2014;

(1) The expenses paid or provided in kind are comparable in value to those offered to or purchased by other similarly situated meeting attendees; and

(i) Only the types of travel expenses that are authorized by your travel authorization (meals, lodging, transportation, but not recreation or other personal expenses); and

(ii) Only travel expenses that are within the maximum allowances stated on your travel authorization (e.g., if your travel authorization states that you are authorized to incur lodging expenses up to $100 per night, you may not accept payment from the non-Federal source for a $200 per night hotel room);

(2) You must request your agency's authorization for acceptance from the non-Federal source within 7 working days after your trip ends; and

Your reimbursement is limited to the types of expenses authorized in Chapter 301 of this title or analogous provisions of the Joint Travel Regulations or Foreign Affairs Manual. Reimbursement from your agency for expenses will not in any case exceed the amount of the expenses you incur. Such reimbursement will also adhere to established regulatory limitations except where your agency accepts payments under § 304&#x2013;5.4, § 304&#x2013;5.5 or § 304&#x2013;5.6 of this chapter.

However, you may be required to report any such payments that you and/or your accompanying spouse receive on your own behalf, rather than on the agency's behalf, pursuant to other reporting requirements (e.g., those required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978).

###### Subpart D - Penalties

###### Subpart E - Relation to Other Authorities

####### § 304-3.19 Are there other situations when I may accept payment from a non-Federal source for my travel expenses?

Yes, you may also accept payment of travel expenses from a non-Federal source under the following authorities, in addition to this part:

(a) Under 5 U.S.C. 4111 for acceptance of contributions, awards, and other payments from tax-exempt entities for non-Government sponsored training or meetings (see regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR part 410).

(b) Under 5 U.S.C. 7342 for travel taking place entirely outside the United States which is paid by a foreign government, where acceptance is permitted by your agency and any regulations which may be prescribed by your agency.

(c) Under 5 U.S.C. 7324(b) when payment is for travel to be performed for a partisan rather than an official purpose in accordance with the Hatch Act (5 U.S.C. 7321&#x2013;7326); or

(d) Pursuant to the applicable standards of ethical conduct regulations concerning personal acceptance of gifts. For example, under 5 CFR 2635.204(e), which authorizes executive branch employees to accept gifts based on outside business employment relationships. (Note: You may also be able to accept attendance at, but not other travel expenses to, a widely attended gathering under 5 CFR 2635.204(g) when the gathering is not a meeting, as defined in this part, and you are not attending in your official capacity. Unless authorized to do so by your agency, you may not accept travel, subsistence, or related expenses, including meals, offered by a non-Federal source for participation as a speaker, panelist, or presenter at a meeting or similar function that takes place away from your permanent duty station. Such expenses are considered payments in kind and must be accepted, if at all, in accordance with this part.)

Use of pronouns “we”, “you”, and their variants throughout this part refers to the agency.

###### § 304-4.2 What is the purpose of this part?

The purpose of this part is to establish Governmentwide policy and guidance for acceptance by a Federal agency of payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source for employees to attend meetings under 31 U.S.C. 1353. It prescribes how such payments may be accepted.

###### § 304-4.3 Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source?

You may accept payment for travel expenses to events other than meetings from a non-Federal source pursuant to an agency gift statute or similar statutory authority. However, this part 304 is the only authority you may use to accept (or authorize your employee to accept on your behalf) payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source to attend a meeting. For example, you could not pay the travel expenses for an employee to attend a meeting and then authorize the employee to use the widely attended gathering exception in 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) to accept free attendance at that same meeting. You would only be able to accept payment for the employee's attendance at that meeting under this part 304.

An official at the highest practical administrative level who can evaluate the requirements in § 304&#x2013;5.3, must approve acceptance of such payments.

###### § 304-5.3 What does our approving official need to consider before authorizing acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel expenses for a meeting?

(a) The approving official must not authorize acceptance of the payment if he/she determines that acceptance of the payment under the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts relevant to a particular case to question the integrity of agency programs or operations. The approving official must be guided by all relevant considerations, including but not limited to the&#x2014;

(1) Identity of the non-Federal source;

(2) Purpose of the meeting;

(3) Identity of other expected participants;

(4) Nature and sensitivity of any matter pending at the agency which may affect the interest of the non-Federal source;

(5) Significance of the employee's role in any such matter; and

(6) Monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered by the non-Federal source.

###### § 304-5.5 May we authorize an employee to use other than coach class accommodations on common carriers if we accept payment in full from a non-Federal source for such transportation expenses?

Yes, you may authorize an employee to use other than coach class accommodations on common carriers as long as the:

(a) Non-Federal source makes full payment for such transportation services in advance of travel; and

(b) Transportation accommodations furnished are comparable in value to those offered to, or purchased by other similarly situated meeting attendees; and

(c) Travel meets at least one of the conditions in § 301&#x2013;10.103 of this title.

Yes, you may accept payment from more than one non-Federal source for a single trip, as long as the total of such payments do not exceed the total cost of the trip.

If applicable, acceptance of the registration fee must be reported to U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) in accordance with part 304&#x2013;6 of this chapter.

(b) When a waived or discounted registration fee is not a payment in kind pursuant to § 304&#x2013;3.10 of this chapter, the employee may only accept items that you authorize separately. If applicable, the value of any payments in kind so accepted should be reported to OGE in accordance with part 304&#x2013;6 of this chapter. In particular, if a registration fee is waived or discounted on the day(s) an employee is participating as a speaker, panelist, or presenter, and the registration fee includes meal(s), the employee may accept meal(s) as a payment in kind only if you review the offer and authorize acceptance. Review the reporting guidelines at § 304&#x2013;6.4 of this chapter to see if the aggregated meal amounts (if more than one meal, or meals of both an employee and spouse) will need to be reported to OGE.

However, a waiver or discount of the registration fee by the non-Federal sponsor of the event for the day(s) the employee participated in the meeting or similar function as a speaker, panelist, or presenter is not a payment in kind and does not need to be reported.

(b) For transportation or lodging, you must report the cost that the non-Federal source paid or usually would have been charged for such event.

(c) For meals, you must use the M&IE deduction chart for CONUS and OCONUS located atand report the appropriate amount for each meal based on the temporary duty locality.

(a) Within 30 days after the applicable due date.

(b) Within 30 days after the date OGE actually receives the report.

####### § 304-6.9 Does acceptance by OGE of the Standard Form (SF) 326 constitute a determination by OGE that the data submitted is adequate or a concurrence by OGE in the agency's conflict of interest analysis?
