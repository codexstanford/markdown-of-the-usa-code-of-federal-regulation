##### Subpart G - Exempt Systems of Records

###### § 6.86 General exemptions.

(a) Whenever the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, determines it to be necessary and proper, with respect to any system of records maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to exercise the right to promulgate rules to exempt such systems in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), each specific exemption, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for each exemption shall be published in theas part of FEMA's Notice of Systems of Records.

(b) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), (3), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), (e) (5) and (8) (f) and (g) of the Privacy Act.

####### Exempt systems.

(1)The following systems of records, which contain information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552(j)(2), shall be exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

####### Reasons for exemptions.

(2)(i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would give individuals an opportunity to learn whether they are of record either as suspects or as subjects of a criminal investigation; this would compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to complete investigations and identify or detect violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Individuals would be able (A) to take steps to avoid detection, (B) to inform co-conspirators of the fact that an investigation is being conducted, (C) to learn the nature of the investigation to which they are being subjected, (D) to learn the type of surveillance being utilized, (E) to learn whether they are only suspects or identified law violators, (F) to continue to resume their illegal conduct without fear of detection upon learning that they are not in a particular system of records, and (G) to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.

(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would compromise its ability to complete or continue criminal investigations and to detect or identify violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed system of records would provide individuals with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, and this could enable them to avoid detection or apprehension in the following ways:

(A) By discovering the collection of facts which would form the basis for their arrest, (B) by enabling them to destroy evidence of criminal conduct which would form the basis for their arrest, and (C) by learning that the criminal investigators had reason to believe that a crime was about to be committed, they could delay the commission of the crime or change the scene of the crime to a location which might not be under surveillance. Granting access to ongoing or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning criminal activity to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing law enforcement officers' established investigative tools and procedures. Further, granting access to investigative files and records could disclose the identity of confidential sources and other informers and the nature of the information which they supplied, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those sources of information by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided information relating to the criminal activities of those individuals who are the subjects of the investigative files and records; confidential sources and other informers might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information if they could not be secure in the knowledge that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure of either their names or the nature of the information they supplied, and this would seriously impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mandate to enforce criminal and related laws. Additionally, providing access to records contained in the above-listed system of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement personnel who compiled information regarding individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those undercover personnel or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.

(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4), which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of other law enforcement agencies to make effective use of information provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the investigation, detection and apprehension of violators of the criminal laws enforced by those other law enforcement agencies. Making accountings of disclosure available to violators or possible violators would alert those individuals to the fact that another agency is conducting an investigation into their criminal activities, and this could reveal the geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other geographic areas or by destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for their arrest. In addition, providing violators with accountings of disclosure would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has information regarding their criminal activities and could inform those individuals of the general nature of that information; this, in turn, would afford those individuals a better opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid detection or apprehension for violations of criminal and related laws.

(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires that an agency inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. Since this provision is dependent on an individual's having been provided an opportunity to contest (seek amendment to) records pertaining to him/her, and since the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt from those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to amendments of records as indicated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that this provision should not be applicable to the above system of records.

(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires that an agency publish a public notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The categories of sources of this system of records have been published in thein broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.

####### maintain

(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The termas defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes "collect" and "disseminate." At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of an investigation, and in many cases, information which initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law discovered during a criminal investigation fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMA investigation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, therefore, believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).

(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires that an agency collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct investigations and to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws for the following reasons:

(A) Most information collected about an individual under criminal investigations is obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers, and it is usually not feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his/her criminal activities, (B) an attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to attempt to conceal his/her criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension, (C) in certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation is not required to supply information to criminal investigators as a matter of legal duty, and (D) during criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound investigative procedures to obtain information from a variety of sources in order to verify information already obtained.

(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires that an agency inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, either on the form which the agency uses to collect the information or on a separate form which can be retained by the individual, with the following information: The authority which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; the routine uses which may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual of not providing all or part of the requested information. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision in order to avoid adverse effects on its ability to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws. In many cases, information is obtained by confidential sources, other informers or undercover law enforcement officers under circumstances where it is necessary that the true purpose of their actions be kept secret so as to avoid alerting the subject of the investigation or his/her associates that a criminal investigation is in process. Further, if it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in a criminal investigation, that officer's life or physical safety could be endangered through reprisal, and, under such circumstances it may not be possible to continue to utilize that officer in the investigation. In many cases, individuals, for personal reasons, would feel inhibited in talking to a person representing a criminal law enforcement agency but would be willing to talk to a confidential source or undercover officer who they believe is not involved in law enforcement activities. In addition, providing a source of information with written evidence that he was a source, as required by this provision, could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be the subject of retaliatory action by the subject of the investigation. Further, application of this provision could result in an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the subject of the criminal investigation, particularly where further investigation would result in a finding that the subject was not involved in any criminal activity.

(x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires that an agency maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines "maintain" to include "collect" and "disseminate," application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would hinder the initial collection of any information which could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, relevant, timely and complete. Similarly, application of this provision would seriously restrict the necessary flow of information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to other law enforcement agencies when a FEMA investigation revealed information pertaining to a violation of law which was under investigative jurisdiction of another agency. In collecting information during the course of a criminal investigation, it is not possible or feasible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to collection of the information; in disseminating information to other law enforcement agencies it is often not possible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to dissemination because the disseminating agency may not have the expertise with which to make such determinations. Further, information which may initially appear to be inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete may, when gathered, grouped, and evaluated with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise of their judgment in reporting on results obtained during criminal investigations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5).

(xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires that an agency make reasonable effort to serve notice on an individual when any record on the individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempt from this provision in order to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those records and in order to prevent revelation of the existence on an on-going investigation where there is a need to keep the existence of the investigation secret.

(xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides civil remedies to an individual for an agency's refusal to amend a record or to make a review of a request for amendment; for an agency's refusal to grant access to a record; for an agency's failure to maintain accurate, relevant, timely and complete records which are used to make a determination which is adverse to the individual; and for an agency's failure to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision to the extent that the civil remedies provided therein may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt. Since the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section are proposed to be inapplicable to the above-listed systems of records for the reasons stated therein, there should be no corresponding civil remedies for failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions to which the exemption is proposed to apply. Further, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would adversely affect its ability to conduct criminal investigations by exposing to civil court action every stage of the criminal investigative process in which information is compiled or used in order to identify, detect, or otherwise investigate persons suspected or known to be engaged in criminal conduct.

(xiii) Individuals may not have access to another agency's records, which are contained in files maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when that other agency's regulations provide that such records are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, FEMA will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.

###### § 6.87 Specific exemptions.

####### Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).

(a)The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency has determined that certain systems of records may be exempt from the requirements of (c)(3) and (d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to the extent that the system contains any information properly classified under Executive Order 12356 or any subsequent Executive order and which are required to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. To the extent that this occurs, such records in the following systems would be exempt:

####### Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f).

(b)The Federal Emergency Management Agency will not deny individuals access to information which has been used to deny them a right, privilege, or benefit to which they would otherwise be entitled.

####### Exempt systems.

(1)The following systems of records, which contain information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), shall be exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

####### Reasons for exemptions.

(2)(i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of FEMA to successfully complete investigations and inquiries of suspected violators of civil and criminal laws and regulations under its jurisdiction. In many cases investigations and inquiries into violations of civil and criminal laws and regulations involve complex and continuing patterns of behavior. Individuals, if informed, that they have been identified as suspected violators of civil or criminal laws and regulations, would have an opportunity to take measures to prevent detection of illegal action so as to avoid prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. They would also be able to learn the nature and location of the investigation or inquiry, the type of surveillance being utilized, and they would be able to transmit this knowledge to co-conspirators. Finally, violators might be given the opportunity to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation under investigation or inquiry.

(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair its ability to complete or continue civil or criminal investigations and inquiries and to detect violators of civil or criminal laws. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed systems of records would provide violators with significant information concerning the nature of the civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. Knowledge of the facts developed during an investigation or inquiry would enable violators of criminal and civil laws and regulations to learn the extent to which the investigation or inquiry has progressed, and this could provide them with an opportunity to destroy evidence that would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. In addition, knowledge gained through access to investigatory material could alert a violator to the need to temporarily postpone commission of the violation or to change the intended point where the violation is to be committed so as to avoid detection or apprehension. Further, access to investigatory material would disclose investigative techniques and procedures which, if known, could enable violators to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing investigators' established and effective investigative tools and procedures. In addition, investigatory material may contain the identity of a confidential source of information or other informer who would not want his/her identity to be disclosed for reasons of personal privacy or for fear of reprisal at the hands of the individual about whom he/she supplied information. In some cases mere disclosure of the information provided by an informer would reveal the identity of the informer either through the process of elimination or by virtue of the nature of the information supplied. If informers cannot be assured that their identities (as sources for information) will remain confidential, they would be very reluctant in the future to provide information pertaining to violations of criminal and civil laws and regulations, and this would seriously compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mission. Further, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) to the above-listed systems of records would make available attorney's work product and other documents which contain evaluations, recommendations, and discussions of on-going civil and criminal legal proceedings; the availability of such documents could have a chilling effect on the free flow of information and ideas within the Federal Emergency Management Agency which is vital to the agency's predecisional deliberative process, could seriously prejudice the agency's or the Government's position in a civil or criminal litigation, and could result in the disclosure of investigatory material which should not be disclosed for the reasons stated above. It is the belief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that, in both civil actions and criminal prosecutions, due process will assure that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to learn of the existence of, and to challenge, investigatory records and related materials which are to be used in legal proceedings.

(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph, and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and inquiries into civil and criminal violations under their respective jurisdictions. Making accountings available to violators would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another law enforcement authority is conducting an investigation or inquiry into their activities, and such accountings could reveal the geographic location of the investigation or inquiry, the nature and purpose of the investigation or inquiry and the nature of the information disclosed, and the date on which that investigation or inquiry was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, transferring their activities to other locations or destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions.

####### maintain

(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The termas defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes "collect" and "disseminate." At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of investigation or inquiry, and in many cases information which initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation or inquiry, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law uncovered during a Federal Emergency Management Agency inquiry fall within the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMAs civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. The Federal Emergency Management Agency therefore believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).

####### Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).

(c)The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency has determined that certain systems of records are exempt from the requirements of (c)(3) and (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.

####### Exempt systems.

(1)The following systems of records, which contain information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), shall be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a listed in paragraph (c) of this section.

####### Reasons for exemptions.

(2)All information about individuals in these records that meet the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosure available to the subject and access to and amendment of records. These exemptions are claimed because the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management Information System, contains investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for access to classified information or classified Federal contracts, but only to the extent that the disclosure would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. During the litigation process and investigations, it is possible that certain records from the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management System may be necessary and relevant to the litigation or investigation and included in these systems of records. To the extent that this occurs, the Administrator, FEMA, has determined that the records would also be exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) to protect such records. A determination will be made at the time of the request for a record concerning whether specific information would reveal the identity of a source. This exemption is required in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of information compiled for the purpose of determining access to classified information. This confidentiality helps maintain the Government's continued access to information from persons who would otherwise refuse to give it.

In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible agency official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantee, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.

####### Compliance reports.

(b)Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the responsible agency official or his designee timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible agency official or his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this regulation. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this regulation.

####### Access to sources of information.

(c)Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible agency official or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this regulation. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

####### Information to beneficiaries and participants.

(d)Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this regulation and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protection against discrimination assured them by the Act and this regulation.

###### § 7.11 Conduct of investigations.

####### Periodic compliance reviews.

(a)The responsible agency official or his designee shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this regulation.

####### Complaints.

(b)Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this regulation may by himself or by a representative file a written complaint with the National Headquarters or any Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible agency official or his designee.

####### Investigations.

(c)The responsible agency official or his designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this regulation. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this regulation occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this regulation.

####### Resolution of matters.

(d)(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this regulation, the responsible agency official or his designee will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in section 12.

(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the responsible agency official or his designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

####### Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.

(e)No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this regulation, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this regulation. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this regulation, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

###### § 7.12 Procedure for effecting compliance.

####### General.

(a)If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this regulation may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under state or local law.

(b)If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under section 7 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The agency shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the agency shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application thereof approved prior to the effective date of this regulation.

####### Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.

(c)No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this regulation, (3) the action has been approved by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to section 14, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Administrator has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

####### Other means authorized by law.

(d)No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the action has been approved by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, (3) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (4) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person.

The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and section 12(c) of this regulation and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

(iii) That before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Administrator, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;

(iv) That the notice must state: The alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court (Federal or State) of the United States.

L. 93-234); and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Pub. L. 91-190). Section 2(d) of Executive Order 11988 requires issuance of new or amended regulations and procedures to satisfy its substantive and procedural provisions. E.O. 11990 was issued in furtherance of NEPA, and at section 6 required issuance of new or amended regulations and procedures to satisfy its substantive and procedural provisions.

##### § 9.4 Definitions.

The following definitions shall apply throughout this regulation.

###### Action

means any action or activity including: (a) Acquiring, managing and disposing of Federal lands and facilities; (b) providing federally undertaken, financed or assisted construction and improvements; and (c) conducting Federal activities and programs affecting land use, including, but not limited to, water and related land resources, planning, regulating and licensing activities.

###### Actions Affecting or Affected by Floodplains or Wetlands

means actions which have the potential to result in the long- or short-term impacts associated with (a) the occupancy or modification of floodplains, and the direct or indirect support of floodplain development, or (b) the destruction and modification of wetlands and the direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands.

###### Administrator

means the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

###### Agency

means the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

###### Agency Assistance

means grants for projects or planning activities, loans, and all other forms of financial or technical assistance provided by the Agency.

###### Base Flood

means the flood which has a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year (also known as a 100-year flood). This term is used in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to indicate the minimum level of flooding to be used by a community in its floodplain management regulations.

###### Base Floodplain

means the 100-year floodplain (one percent chance floodplain).

###### Coastal High Hazard Area

means the areas subject to high velocity waters including but not limited to hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. On a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), this appears as zone V1-30, VE or V.

###### Critical Action

means an action for which even a slight chance of flooding is too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical actions is the 500-year floodplain, i.e., critical action floodplain. Critical actions include, but are not limited to, those which create or extend the useful life of structures or facilities:

(a) Such as those which produce, use or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic or water-reactive materials;

(b) Such as hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;

(c) Such as emergency operation centers, or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and

(d) Such as generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines.

###### Direct Impacts

means changes in floodplain or wetland values and functions and changes in the risk to lives and property caused or induced by an action or related activity. Impacts are caused whenever these natural values and functions are affected as a direct result of an action. An action which would result in the discharge of polluted storm waters into a floodplain or wetland, for example, would directly affect their natural values and functions. Construction-related activities, such as dredging and filling operations within the floodplain or a wetland would be another example of impacts caused by an action.

###### Emergency Actions

means emergency work essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety performed under sections 305 and 306 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5145 and 5146). See 44 CFR part 205, subpart E.

###### Enhance

means to increase, heighten, or improve the natural and beneficial values associated with wetlands.

###### Facility

means any man-made or man-placed item other than a structure.

###### FEMA

###### Five Hundred Year Floodplain

(the 500-year floodplain or 0.2 percent change floodplain) means that area, including the base floodplain, which is subject to inundation from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.

###### Flood,flooding

ormeans a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland and/or tidal waters, and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

###### Flood Fringe

means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway (often referred to as "floodway fringe").

###### Flood Hazard Boundary Map

(FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zone A, M, or E.

###### Flood Insurance Rate Map

(FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. FIRMs are also available digitally, and are called Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM).

###### Flood Insurance Study

(FIS) means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.

###### Floodplain

means the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters including, at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Wherever in this regulation the term "floodplain" is used, if a critical action is involved, "floodplain" shall mean the area subject to inundation from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year (500-year floodplain). "Floodplain" does not include areas subject only to mudflow until FIA adopts maps identifying "M" Zones.

###### Floodproofing

means the modification of individual structures and facilities, their sites, and their contents to protect against structural failure, to keep water out, or to reduce effects of water entry.

###### Floodway

means that portion of the floodplain which is effective in carrying flow, within which this carrying capacity must be preserved and where the flood hazard is generally highest, i.e., where water depths and velocities are the greatest. It is that area which provides for the discharge of the base flood so the cumulative increase in water surface elevation is no more than one foot.

###### Functionally Dependent Use

means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, (e.g., bridges, and piers).

###### Indirect Impacts

means an indirect result of an action whenever the action induces or makes possible related activities which effect the natural values and functions of floodplains or wetlands or the risk to lives and property. Such impacts occur whenever these values and functions are potentially affected, either in the short- or long-term, as a result of undertaking an action.

###### Minimize

means to reduce to the smallest amount or degree possible.

###### Mitigation

means all steps necessary to minimize the potentially adverse effects of the proposed action, and to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial floodplain values and to preserve and enhance natural values of wetlands.

###### Mitigation Directorate

means the Mitigation Directorate of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

###### Natural Values of Floodplains and Wetlands

means the qualities of or functions served by floodplains and wetlands which include but are not limited to: (a) Water resource values (natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge); (b) living resource values (fish, wildlife, plant resources and habitats); (c) cultural resource values (open space, natural beauty, scientific study, outdoor education, archeological and historic sites, recreation); and (d) cultivated resource values (agriculture, aquaculture, forestry).

###### New Construction

means the construction of a new structure (including the placement of a mobile home) or facility or the replacement of a structure or facility which has been totally destroyed.

###### New Construction in Wetlands

includes draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, and related activities and any structures or facilities begun or authorized after the effective dates of the Orders, May 24, 1977.

###### Orders

means Executive Orders 11988, Floodplain Management, and 11990, Protection of Wetlands.

###### Practicable

means capable of being done within existing constraints. The test of what is practicable depends upon the situation and includes consideration of all pertinent factors, such as environment, cost and technology.

###### Preserve

means to prevent alterations to natural conditions and to maintain the values and functions which operate the floodplains or wetlands in their natural states.

###### Regional Administrator

means the Regional Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Region in which FEMA is acting, or the Disaster Recovery Manager when one is designated.

###### Regulatory Floodway

means the area regulated by federal, State or local requirements to provide for the discharge of the base flood so the cumulative increase in water surface elevation is no more than a designated amount (not to exceed one foot as set by the National Flood Insurance Program).

###### Restore

means to reestablish a setting or environment in which the natural functions of the floodplain can again operate.

###### Structures

means walled or roofed buildings, including mobile homes and gas or liquid storage tanks.

###### Substantial Improvement

means any repair, reconstruction or other improvement of a structure or facility, which has been damaged in excess of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50% of the market value of the structure or replacement cost of the facility (including all "public facilities" as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974) (a) before the repair or improvement is started, or (b) if the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to be restored, before the damage occurred. If a facility is an essential link in a larger system, the percentage of damage will be based on the relative cost of repairing the damaged facility to the replacement cost of the portion of the system which is operationally dependent on the facility. The term "substantial improvement" does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

###### Support

means to encourage, allow, serve or otherwise facilitate floodplain or wetland development. Direct support results from actions within a floodplain or wetland, and indirect support results from actions outside of floodplains or wetlands.

###### Wetlands,Classification of Wetlands and Deep Water Habitats of the United States

means those areas which are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, or that under normal hydrologic conditions does or would support, a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life typically adapted for life in saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions. Examples of wetlands include, but are not limited to, swamps, fresh and salt water marshes, estuaries, bogs, beaches, wet meadows, sloughs, potholes, mud flats, river overflows and other similar areas. This definition includes those wetlands areas separated from their natural supply of water as a result of activities such as the construction of structural flood protection methods or solid-fill road beds and activities such as mineral extraction and navigation improvements. This definition is intended to be consistent with the definition utilized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the publication entitled(Cowardin, et al., 1977).

##### § 9.5 Scope.

###### Applicability.

(a)(1) These regulations apply to all Agency actions which have the potential to affect floodplains or wetlands or their occupants, or which are subject to potential harm by location in floodplains or wetlands.

(2) The basic test of the potential of an action to affect floodplains or wetlands is the action's potential (both by itself and when viewed cumulatively with other proposed actions) to result in the long- or short-term adverse impacts associated with:

(i) The occupancy or modification of floodplains, and the direct and indirect support of floodplain development; or

(ii) The destruction or modification of wetlands and the direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands.

(3) This regulation applies to actions that were, on the effective date of the Orders (May 24, 1977), ongoing, in the planning and/or development stages, or undergoing implementation, and are incomplete as of the effective date of these regulations. The regulation also applies to proposed (new) actions. The Agency shall:

(i) Determine the applicable provisions of the Orders by analyzing whether the action in question has progressed beyond critical stages in the floodplain management and wetlands protection decision-making process, as set out below in § 9.6. This determination need only be made at the time that followup actions are being taken to complete or implement the action in question; and

(ii) Apply the provisions of the Orders and of this regulation to all such actions to the fullest extent practicable.

###### Limited exemption of ongoing actions involving wetlands located outside the floodplains.

(b)(1) Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, contains a limited exemption not found in Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management. Therefore, this exemption applies only to actions affecting wetlands which are located outside the floodplains, and which have no potential to result in harm to or within floodplains or to support floodplain development.

(2) The following proposed actions that impact wetlands located outside of floodplains are exempt from this regulation:

(i) Agency-assisted or permitted projects which were under construction before May 24, 1977; and

(ii) Projects for which the Agency has proposed a draft of a final environmental impact statement (EIS) which adequately analyzes the action and which was filed before October 1, 1977. Proposed actions that impact wetlands outside of floodplains are not exempt if the EIS:

(A) Only generally covers the proposed action;

(B) Is devoted largely to related activities; or

(C) Treats the project area or program without an adequate and specific analysis of the floodplain and wetland implications of the proposed action.

###### Decision-making involving certain categories of actions.,not applicable

(c)The provisions set forth in this regulation areto the actions enumerated below except that the Regional Administrators shall comply with the spirit of the Order to the extent practicable. For any action which is excluded from the actions enumerated below, the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6) (except as indicated at paragraphs (d), (f) and (g) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusions). The provisions of these regulations do not apply to the following (all references are to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-288, as amended, except as noted):

(1) Assistance provided for emergency work essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety performed pursuant to sections 305 and 306;

(2) Emergency Support Teams (section 304);

(3) Unemployment Assistance (section 407);

(4) Emergency Communications (section 415);

(5) Emergency Public Transportation (section 416);

(8) The following Individual and Family Grant Program (section 408) actions:

(i) Housing needs or expenses, except for restoring, repairing or building private bridges, purchase of mobile homes and provision of structures as minimum protective measures;

(ii) Personal property needs or expenses;

(iii) Transportation expenses;

(iv) Medical/dental expenses;

(v) Funeral expenses;

(vi) Limited home repairs;

(vii) Flood insurance premium;

(viii) Cost estimates;

(ix) Food expenses; and

(x) Temporary rental accommodations.

(9) Mortgage and rental assistance under section 404(b);

(10) Use of existing resources in the temporary housing assistance program [section 404(a)], except that Step 1 (§ 9.7) shall be carried out;

(11) Minimal home repairs [section 404(c)];

(12) Debris removal (section 403), except those grants involving non-emergency disposal of debris within a floodplain or wetland;

(13) Repairs or replacements under section 402, of less than $5,000 to damaged structures or facilities.

(14) Placement of families in existing resources and Temporary Relocation Assistance provided to those families so placed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, Public Law 96-510.

###### shall apply steps 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8

(d) For each action enumerated below, the Regional Administratorof the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.8, 9.10 and 9.11, see § 9.6). Steps 3 and 6 (§ 9.9) shall be carried out except that alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland need not be considered. After assessing impacts of the proposed action on the floodplain or wetlands and of the site on the proposed action, alternative actions to the proposed action, if any, and the "no action" alternative shall be considered. The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. For any action which is excluded from the actions listed below. (except as indicated in paragraphs (c), (f) and (g) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6). The references are to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Public Law 93-288, as amended.

(1) Actions performed under the Individual and Family Grant Program (section 408) for restoring or repairing a private bridge, except where two or more individuals or families are authorized to pool their grants for this purpose.

(2) Small project grants (section 419), except to the extent that Federal funding involved is used for construction of new facilities or structures.

(3) Replacement of building contents, materials and equipment. (sections 402 and 419).

(4) Repairs under section 402 to damaged facilities or structures, except any such action for which one or more of the following is applicable:

(i) FEMA estimated cost of repairs is more than 50% of the estimated reconstruction cost of the entire facility or structure, or is more than $100,000, or

(ii) The action is located in a floodway or coastal high hazard area, or

(iii) The facility or structure is one which has previously sustained structural damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency or on which a flood insurance claim has been paid, or

(iv) The action is a critical action.

###### Other categories of actions.

(e)Based upon the completion of the 8-step decision-making process (§ 9.6), the Director may find that a specific category of actions either offers no potential for carrying out the purposes of the Orders and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(c), or has no practicable alternative sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(d), or has no practicable alternative actions or sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in § 9.5(g). This finding will be made in consultation with the Federal Insurance Administration and the Council on Environmental Quality as provided in section 2(d) of E.O. 11988. Public notice of each of these determinations shall include publication in theand a 30-day comment period.

###### The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

(f)(1) Most of what is done by FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, in administering the National Flood Insurance Program is performed on a program-wide basis. For all regulations, procedures or other issuances making or amending program policy, FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, shall apply the 8-step decision-making process to that program-wide action. The action to which the 8-step process must be applied is the establishment of programmatic standards or criteria, not the application of programmatic standards or criteria to specific situations. Thus, for example, FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, would apply the 8-step process to a programmatic determination of categories of structures to be insured, but not to whether to insure each individual structure. The two prime examples of where FIA or the Mitigation Directorate, does take site specific actions which would require individual application of the 8-step process are property acquisition under section 1362 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and the issuance of an exception to a community under 44 CFR 60.6(b). (See also § 9.9(e)(6) and § 9.11(e).)

(2) The provisions set forth in this regulation are not applicable to the actions enumerated below except that the Federal Insurance Administrator or the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation, as appropriate shall comply with the spirit of the Orders to the extent practicable:

(i) The issuance of individual flood insurance policies and policy interpretations;

(ii) The adjustment of claims made under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy;

(iii) The hiring of independent contractors to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program;

(iv) The issuance of individual flood insurance maps, Map Information Facility map determinations, and map amendments; and

(v) The conferring of eligibility for emergency or regular program (NFIP) benefits upon communities.

###### shall apply steps 1, 4, 5 and 8

(g) For the action listed below, the Regional Administratorof the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.10 and 9.11). For any action which is excluded from the actions listed below, (except as indicated in paragraphs (c), (d) and (f) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (See § 9.6). The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. The references are to the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, Public Law 93-288. The above requirements apply to repairs, under section 402, between $5,000 and $25,000 to damaged structures of facilities except for:

(1) Actions in a floodway or coastal high hazard area; or

(2) New or substantially improved structures or facilities; or

(3) Facilities or structures which have previously sustained structural damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency.

##### § 9.6 Decision-making process.

###### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of this section is to set out the floodplain management and wetlands protection decision-making process to be followed by the Agency in applying the Orders to its actions. While the decision-making process was initially designed to address the floodplain Order's requirements, the process will also satisfy the wetlands Order's provisions due to the close similarity of the two directives. The numbering of Steps 1 through 8 does not firmly require that the steps be followed sequentially. As information is gathered throughout the decision-making process and as additional information is needed, reevaluation of lower numbered steps may be necessary.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in § 9.5 (c), (d), (f), and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion when proposing an action, the Agency shall apply the 8-step decision-making process. FEMA shall:

###### Step 1.

Determine whether the proposed action is located in a wetland and/or the 100-year floodplain (500-year floodplain for critical actions); and whether it has the potential to affect or be affected by a floodplain or wetland (see § 9.7);

###### Step 2.

Notify the public at the earliest possible time of the intent to carry out an action in a floodplain or wetland, and involve the affected and interested public in the decision-making process (see § 9.8);

###### Step 3.

Identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to locating the proposed action in a floodplain or wetland (including alternative sites, actions and the "no action" option) (see § 9.9). If a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland FEMA must locate the action at the alternative site.

###### Step 4.

Identify the potential direct and indirect impacts associated with the occupancy or modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action (see § 9.10);

###### Step 5.

Minimize the potential adverse impacts and support to or within floodplains and wetlands to be identified under Step 4, restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains, and preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values served by wetlands (see § 9.11);

###### Step 6.

Reevaluate the proposed action to determine first, if it is still practicable in light of its exposure to flood hazards, the extent to which it will aggravate the hazards to others, and its potential to disrupt floodplain and wetland values and second, if alternatives preliminarily rejected at Step 3 are practicable in light of the information gained in Steps 4 and 5. FEMA shall not act in a floodplain or wetland unless it is the only practicable location (see § 9.9);

###### Step 7.

Prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation of any final decision that the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative (see § 9.12); and

###### Step 8.

Review the implementation and post-implementation phases of the proposed action to ensure that the requirements stated in § 9.11 are fully implemented. Oversight responsibility shall be integrated into existing processes.

##### § 9.7 Determination of proposed action's location.

(a) The purpose of this section is to establish Agency procedures for determining whether any action as proposed is located in or affects (1) the base floodplain (the Agency shall substitute the 500-year floodplain for the base floodplain where the action being proposed involves a critical action), or (2) a wetland.

###### Information needed.

(b)The Agency shall obtain enough information so that it can fulfill the requirements of the Orders to (1) avoid floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives; and (2) minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands. In all cases, FEMA shall determine whether the proposed action is located in a floodplain or wetland. In the absence of a finding to the contrary, FEMA may assume that a proposed action involving a facility or structure that has been flooded is in the floodplain. Information about the 100-year and 500-year floods and location of floodways and coastal high hazard areas may also be needed to comply with these regulations, especially § 9.11. The following additional flooding characteristics shall be identified by the Regional Administrator as appropriate:

(i) Velocity of floodwater;

(ii) Rate of rise of floodwater;

(iii) Duration of flooding;

(iv) Available warning and evacuation time and routes;

(v) Special problems:

(A) Levees;

(B) Erosion;

(C) Subsidence;

(D) Sink holes;

(E) Ice jams;

(F) Debris load;

(G) Pollutants;

(H) Wave heights;

(I) Groundwater flooding;

(J) Mudflow.

###### Floodplain determination.

(c)(1) In the search for flood hazard information, FEMA shall follow the sequence below:

(i) The Regional Administrator shall consult the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) the Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM) and the Flood Insurance Study (FIS).

(ii) If a detailed map (FIRM or FBFM) is not available, the Regional Administrator shall consult an FEMA Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) . If data on flood elevations, floodways, or coastal high hazard areas are needed, or if the map does not delineate the flood hazard boundaries in the vicinity of the proposed site, the Regional Administrator shall seek the necessary detailed information and assistance from the sources listed below.

(iii) If the sources listed do not have or know of the information necessary to comply with the Orders' requirements, the Regional Administrator shall seek the services of a Federal or other engineer experienced in this type of work.

(2) If a decision involves an area or location within extensive Federal or state holdings or a headwater area, and an FIS, FIRM, FBFM, or FHBM is not available, the Regional Administrator shall seek information from the land administering agency before information and/or assistance is sought from the sources listed in this section. If none of these sources has information or can provide assistance, the services of an experienced Federal or other engineer shall be sought as described above.

###### Wetland determination.

(d)The following sequence shall be followed by the Agency in making the wetland determination.

(1) The Agency shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for information concerning the location, scale and type of wetlands within the area which could be affected by the proposed action.

(2) If the FWS does not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall consult wetland inventories maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, various states, communities and others.

(3) If state or other sources do not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall carry out an on-site analysis performed by a representative of the FWS or other qualified individual for wetlands characteristics based on the performance definition of what constitutes a wetland.

(4) If an action is in a wetland but not in a floodplain, and the action is new construction, the provisions of this regulation shall apply. Even if the action is not in a wetland, the Regional Administrator shall determine if the action has the potential to result in indirect impacts on wetlands. If so, all adverse impacts shall be minimized. For actions which are in a wetland and the floodplain, completion of the decision-making process is required. (See § 9.6.) In such a case the wetland will be considered as one of the natural and beneficial values of floodplain.

##### § 9.8 Public notice requirements.

###### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of this section is to establish the initial notice procedures to be followed when proposing any action in or affecting floodplains or wetlands.

###### General.

(b)The Agency shall provide adequate information to enable the public to have impact on the decision outcome for all actions having potential to affect, adversely, or be affected by floodplains or wetlands that it proposes. To achieve this objective, the Agency shall:

(1) Provide the public with adequate information and opportunity for review and comment at the earliest possible time and throughout the decision-making process; and upon completion of this process, provide the public with an accounting of its final decisions (see § 9.12); and

(2) Rely on its environmental assessment processes, to the extent possible, as vehicles for public notice, involvement and explanation.

###### Early public notice.

(c)The Agency shall provide opportunity for public involvement in the decision-making process through the provision of public notice upon determining that the proposed action can be expected to affect or be affected by floodplains or wetlands. Whenever possible, notice shall precede major project site identification and analysis in order to preclude the foreclosure of options consistent with the Orders.

(1) For an action for which an environmental impact statement is being prepared, the Notice of Intent to File an EIS is adequate to constitute the early public notice, if it includes the information required under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

(2) For each action having national significance for which notice is being provided, the Agency shall use theas the minimum means for notice, and shall provide notice by mail to national organizations reasonably expected to be interested in the action. The additional notices listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used in accordance with the determination made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(3) The Agency shall base its determination of appropriate notices, adequate comment periods, and whether to issue cumulative notices (paragraphs (c)(4), (6) and (7) of this section) on factors which include, but are not limited to:

(i) Scale of the action;

(ii) Potential for controversy;

(iii) Degree of public need;

(iv) Number of affected agencies and individuals; and

(v) Its anticipated potential impact.

(4) For each action having primarily local importance for which notice is being provided, notice shall be made in accordance with the criteria under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and shall entail as appropriate:

(i) [Reserved]

(ii) Notice to Indian tribes when effects may occur on reservations.

(iii) Information required in the affected State's public notice procedures for comparable actions.

(iv) Publication in local newspapers (in papers of general circulation rather than legal papers).

(v) Notice through other local media.

(vi) Notice to potentially interested community organizations.

(vii) Publication in newsletters that may be expected to reach potentially interested persons.

(viii) Direct mailing to owners and occupants of nearby or affected property.

(ix) Posting of notice on and off site in the area where the action is to be located.

(x) Holding a public hearing.

(5) The notice shall include:

(i) A description of the action, its purpose and a statement of the intent to carry out an action affecting or affected by a floodplain or wetland;

(ii) Based on the factors in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a map of the area or other indentification of the floodplain and/or wetland areas which is of adequate scale and detail so that the location is discernible; instead of publication of such map, FEMA may state that such map is available for public inspection, including the location at which such map may be inspected and a telephone number to call for information;

(iii) Based on the factors in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a description of the type, extent and degree of hazard involved and the floodplain or wetland values present; and

(iv) Identification of the responsible official or organization for implementing the proposed action, and from whom further information can be obtained.

(6) The Agency shall provide for an adequate comment period.

(7) In a post-disaster situation in particular, the requirement for early public notice may be met in a cumulative manner based on the factors set out in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Several actions may be addressed in one notice or series of notices. For some actions involving limited public interest a single notice in a local newspaper or letter to interested parties may suffice.

###### Continuing public notice.

(d)The Agency shall keep the public informed of the progress of the decision-making process through additional public notices at key points in the process. The preliminary information provided under paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall be augmented by the findings of the adverse effects of the proposed actions and steps necessary to mitigate them. This responsibility shall be performed for actions requiring the preparation of an EIS, and all other actions having the potential for major adverse impacts, or the potential for harm to the health and safety of the general public.

##### § 9.9 Analysis and reevaluation of practicable alternatives.

###### Purpose.

(a)(1) The purpose of this section is to expand upon the directives set out in § 9.6, of this part, in order to clarify and emphasize the Orders' key requirements to avoid floodplains and wetlands unless there is no practicable alternative.

(2) Step 3 is a preliminary determination as to whether the floodplain is the only practicable location for the action. It is a preliminary determination because it comes early in the decision-making process when the Agency has a limited amount of information. If it is clear that there is a practicable alternative, or the floodplain or wetland is itself not a practicable location, FEMA shall then act on that basis. Provided that the location outside the floodplain or wetland does not indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein (see § 9.10), the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is not required. If such location does indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein, the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is required. If the preliminary determination is to act in the floodplain, FEMA shall gather the additional information required under Steps 4 and 5 and then reevaluate all the data to determine if the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative.

###### Analysis of practicable alternatives.

(b)The Agency shall identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to carrying out a proposed action in floodplains or wetlands, including:

(1) Alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland;

(2) Alternative actions which serve essentially the same purpose as the proposed action, but which have less potential to affect or be affected by the floodplain or wetlands; and

###### No action.

(3)The floodplain and wetland site itself must be a practicable location in light of the factors set out in this section.

(c) The Agency shall analyze the following factors in determining the practicability of the alternatives set out in paragraph (b) of this section:

(1) Natural environment (topography, habitat, hazards, etc.);

(2) Social concerns (aesthetics, historical and cultural values, land patterns, etc.);

(3) Economic aspects (costs of space, construction, services, and relocation); and

(4) Legal constraints (deeds, leases, etc.).

###### Action following the analysis of practicable alternatives.

(d)(1) The Agency shall not locate the proposed action in the floodplain or in a wetland if a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland.

(2) For critical actions, the Agency shall not locate the proposed action in the 500-year floodplain if a practicable alternative exists outside the 500-year floodplain.

(3) Even if no practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland, in order to carry out the action the floodplain or wetland must itself be a practicable location in light of the review required in this section.

###### Reevaluation of alternatives.

(e)Upon determination of the impact of the proposed action to or within the floodplain or wetland and of what measures are necessary to comply with the requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands (§ 9.11), FEMA shall:

(1) Determine whether:

(i) The action is still practicable at a floodplain or wetland site in light of the exposure to flood risk and the ensuing disruption of natural values;

(ii) The floodplain or wetland site is the only practicable alternative;

(iii) There is a potential for limiting the action to increase the practicability of previously rejected non-floodplain or wetland sites and alternative actions; and

(iv) Minimization of harm to or within the floodplain can be achieved using all practicable means.

(2) Take no action in a floodplain unless the importance of the floodplain site clearly outweighs the requirement of E.O. 11988 to:

(i) Avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development;

(ii) Reduce the risk of flood loss;

(iii) Minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare; and

(iv) Restore and preserve floodplain values.

(3) Take no action in a wetland unless the importance of the wetland site clearly outweighs the requirements of E.O. 11990 to:

(i) Avoid the destruction or modification of the wetlands;

(ii) Avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands;

(iii) Minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands; and

(iv) Preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands.

(4) In carrying out this balancing process, give the factors in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, the great weight intended by the Orders.

(5) Choose the "no action" alternative where there are no practicable alternative actions or sites and where the floodplain or wetland is not itself a practicable alternative. In making the assessment of whether a floodplain or wetland location is itself a practicable alternative, the practicability of the floodplain or wetland location shall be balanced against the practicability of not carrying out the action at all. That is, even if there is no practicable alternative outside of the floodplain or wetland, the floodplain or wetland itself must be a practicable location in order for the action to be carried out there. To be a practicable location, the importance of carrying out the action must clearly outweigh the requirements of the Orders listed in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Unless the importance of carrying out the action clearly outweighs those requirements, the "no action" alternative shall be selected.

(6) In any case in which the Regional Director has selected the "no action" option, FIA may not provide a new or renewed contract of flood insurance for that structure.

##### § 9.10 Identify impacts of proposed actions.

###### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of this section is to ensure that the effects of proposed Agency actions are identified.

(b) The Agency shall identify the potential direct and indirect adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action. Such identification of impacts shall be to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of the Orders to avoid floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives and to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands.

(c) This identification shall consider whether the proposed action will result in an increase in the useful life of any structure or facility in question, maintain the investment at risk and exposure of lives to the flood hazard or forego an opportunity to restore the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains or wetlands. Regional Offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be contacted to aid in the identification and evaluation of potential impacts of the proposed action on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values.

(d) In the review of a proposed or alternative action, the Regional Administrator shall specifically consider and evaluate: impacts associated with modification of wetlands and floodplains regardless of its location; additional impacts which may occur when certain types of actions may support subsequent action which have additional impacts of their own; adverse impacts of the proposed actions on lives and property and on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values; and the three categories of factors listed below:

###### Flood hazard-related factors.

(1)These include for example, the factors listed in § 9.7(b)(2);

###### Natural values-related factors.

(2)These include, for example, the following: Water resource values (natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and ground water recharge); living resource values (fish and wildlife and biological productivity); cultural resource values (archeological and historic sites, and open space recreation and green belts); and agricultural, aquacultural and forestry resource values.

###### Factors relevant to a proposed action's effects on the survival and quality of wetlands.

(3)These include, for example, the following: Public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards; and sediment and erosion; maintenance of natural systems, including conservation and long term productivity of existing flora and fauna, species and habitat diversity and stability, hydrologic utility, fish, wildlife, timber, and food and fiber resources; and other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.

##### § 9.11 Mitigation.

###### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of this section is to expand upon the directives set out in § 9.6 of this part, and to set out the mitigative actions required if the preliminary determination is made to carry out an action that affects or is in a floodplain or wetland.

###### General provisions.

(b)(1) The Agency shall design or modify its actions so as to minimize harm to or within the floodplain;

(2) The Agency shall minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands;

(3) The Agency shall restore and preserve natural and beneficial floodplain values; and

(4) The Agency shall preserve and enhance natural and beneficial wetland values.

###### Minimization provisions.

(c)The Agency shall minimize:

(1) Potential harm to lives and the investment at risk from the base flood, or, in the case of critical actions, from the 500-year flood;

(2) Potential adverse impacts the action may have on others; and

(3) Potential adverse impact the action may have on floodplain and wetland values.

###### Minimization Standards.

(d)In its implementation of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, the Agency shall apply at a minimum, the following standards to its actions to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c), of this section, (except as provided in § 9.5 (c), (d), and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion). Any Agency action to which the following specific requirements do not apply, shall nevertheless be subject to the full 8-step process (§ 9.6) including the general requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains:

(1) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement in a floodway, and no new construction in a coastal high hazard area, except for:

(i) A functionally dependent use; or

(ii) A structure or facility which facilitates an open space use.

(2) For a structure which is a functionally dependent use, or which facilitates an open space use, the following applies. There shall be no construction of a new or substantially improved structure in a coastal high hazard area unless it is elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns, and securely anchored to such piles or columns so that the lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level (the 500-year flood level for critical actions) (including wave height). The structure shall be anchored so as to withstand velocity waters and hurricane wave wash. The Regional Administrator shall be responsible for determining the base flood level, including the wave height, in all cases. Where there is a FIRM in effect, it shall be the basis of the Regional Administrator's determination. If the FIRM does not reflect wave heights, or if there is no FIRM in effect, the Regional Administrator is responsible for delineating the base flood level, including wave heights.

###### Elevation of structures.

(3)(i) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement of structures unless the lowest floor of the structures (including basement) is at or above the level of the base flood.

(ii) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement of structures involving a critical action unless the lowest floor of the structure (including the basement) is at or above the level of the 500-year flood.

(iii) If the subject structure is nonresidential, FEMA may, instead of elevating the structure to the 100-year or 500-year level, as appropriate, approve the design of the structure and its attendant utility and sanitary facilities so that below the flood level the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.

(iv) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section do not apply to the extent that the Federal Insurance Administration has granted an exception under 44 CFR § 60.6(b) (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(b)), or the community has granted a variance which the Regional Administrator determines is consistent with 44 CFR 60.6(a) (formerly 24 CFR 1910.6(a)). In a community which does not have a FIRM in effect, FEMA may approve a variance from the standards of paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, after compliance with the standards of 44 CFR 60.6(a).

(4) There shall be no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements of structures or facilities, or other development within a designated regulatory floodway that would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the base floodplain unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

(5) Even if an action is a functionally dependent use or facilitates open space uses (under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section) and does not increase flood heights (under paragraph (d)(4) of this section), such action may only be taken in a floodway or coastal high hazard area if:

(i) Such site is the only practicable alternative; and

(ii) Harm to and within the floodplain is minimized.

###### et seq.

(6) In addition to standards (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, no action may be taken if it is inconsistent with the criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59) or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain management standards.

(7) New construction and substantial improvement of structures shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill, in all cases in coastal high hazard areas and elsewhere, where practicable.

(8) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:

(i) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;

(ii) Facilitate adequate access and egress to and from the site of the proposed action; and

(iii) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood, rapid-rise or tsunami areas.

(9) In the replacement of building contents, materials and equipment, the Regional Administrator shall require as appropriate, disaster proofing of the building and/or elimination of such future losses by relocation of those building contents, materials and equipment outside or above the base floodplain or the 500-year floodplain for critical actions.

###### In the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program.

(e)(1) The Federal Insurance Administration shall make identification of all coastal high hazard areas a priority;

(2) Beginning October 1, 1981, the Federal Insurance Administration of FEMA may only provide flood insurance for new construction or substantial improvements in a coastal high hazard area if:

(i) Wave heights have been designated for the site of the structure either by the Administrator of FEMA based upon data generated by FEMA or by another source, satisfactory to the Administrator; and

(ii) The structure is rated by FEMA-FIA based on a system which reflects the capacity to withstand the effects of the 100-year frequency flood including, but not limited to, the following factors:

(A) Wave heights;

(B) The ability of the structure to withstand the force of waves.

(3)(i) FEMA shall accept and take fully into account information submitted by a property owner indicating that the rate for a particular structure is too high based on the ability of the structure to withstand the force of waves. In order to obtain a rate adjustment, a property owner must submit to FEMA specific information regarding the structure and its immediate environment. Such information must be certified by a registered professional architect or engineer who has demonstrable experience and competence in the fields of foundation, soils, and structural engineering. Such information should include:

(A) Elevation of the structure (bottom of lowest floor beam) in relation to the Base Flood Elevation including wave height;

(B) Distance of the structure from the shoreline;

(C) Dune protection and other environmental factors;

(D) Description of the building support system; and

(E) Other relevant building details.

(ii) FIA shall notify communities with coastal high hazard areas and federally related lenders in such communities, of the provisions of this paragraph. Notice to the lenders may be accomplished by the Federal instrumentalities to which the lenders are related.

(4) In any case in which the Regional Director has been, pursuant to § 9.11(d)(1), precluded from providing assistance for a new or substantially improved structure in a floodway, FIA may not provide a new or renewed policy of flood insurance for that structure.

###### Restore and preserve.

(f)(1) For any action taken by the Agency which affects the floodplain or wetland and which has resulted in, or will result in, harm to the floodplain or wetland, the Agency shall act to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains and wetlands.

(2) Where floodplain or wetland values have been degraded by the proposed action, the Agency shall identify, evaluate and implement measures to restore the values.

(3) If an action will result in harm to or within the floodplain or wetland, the Agency shall design or modify the action to preserve as much of the natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values as is possible.

##### § 9.12 Final public notice.

If the Agency decides to take an action in or affecting a floodplain or wetland, it shall provide the public with a statement of its final decision and shall explain the relevant factors considered by the Agency in making this determination.

(a) In addition, those sent notices under § 9.8 shall also be provided the final notice.

(b) For actions for which an environmental impact statement is being prepared, the FEIS is adequate to constitute final notice in all cases except where:

(1) Significant modifications are made in the FEIS after its initial publication;

(2) Significant modifications are made in the development plan for the proposed action; or

(3) Significant new information becomes available in the interim between issuance of the FEIS and implementation of the proposed action.

(c) For actions for which an environmental assessment was prepared, the Notice of No Significant Impact is adequate to constitute final public notice, if it includes the information required under paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) For all other actions, the finding shall be made in a document separate from those described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Based on an assessment of the following factors, the requirement for final notice may be met in a cumulative manner:

(1) Scale of the action;

(2) Potential for controversy;

(3) Degree of public need;

(4) Number of affected agencies and individuals;

(5) Its anticipated potential impact; and

(6) Similarity of the actions, i.e., to the extent that they are susceptible of common descriptions and assessments.

(e) The final notice shall include the following:

(1) A statement of why the proposed action must be located in an area affecting or affected by a floodplain or a wetland;

(2) A description of all significant facts considered in making this determination;

(3) A list of the alternatives considered;

(4) A statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable state and local floodplain protection standards;

(5) A statement indicating how the action affects or is affected by the floodplain and/or wetland, and how mitigation is to be achieved;

(6) Identification of the responsible official or organization for implementation and monitoring of the proposed action, and from whom further information can be obtained; and

(7) A map of the area or a statement that such map is available for public inspection, including the location at which such map may be inspected and a telephone number to call for information.

(f) After providing the final notice, the Agency shall, without good cause shown, wait at least 15 days before carrying out the action.

##### § 9.13 Particular types of temporary housing.

(a) The purpose of this section is to set forth the procedures whereby the Agency will provide certain specified types of temporary housing.

(b) Prior to providing the types of temporary housing enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section, the Agency shall comply with the provisions of this section. For all temporary housing not enumerated below, the full 8-step process (see § 9.6) applies.

(c) The following temporary housing actions are subject to the provisions of this section and not the full 8-step process:

(1) [Reserved]

(2) Placing a mobile home or readily fabricated dwelling on a private or commercial site, but not a group site.

(d) The actions set out in paragraph (c) of this section are subject to the following decision-making process:

(1) The temporary housing action shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of § 9.7 to determine if it is in or affects a floodplain or wetland.

(2) No mobile home or readily fabricated dwelling may be placed on a private or commercial site in a floodway or coastal high hazard area.

(3) An individual or family shall not be housed in a floodplain or wetland unless the Regional Administrator has complied with the provisions of § 9.9 to determine that such site is the only practicable alternative. The following factors shall be substituted for the factors in § 9.9 (c) and (e) (2) through (4):

(i) Speedy provision of temporary housing;

(ii) Potential flood risk to the temporary housing occupant;

(iii) Cost effectiveness;

(iv) Social and neighborhood patterns;

(v) Timely availability of other housing resources; and

(vi) Potential harm to the floodplain or wetland.

(4) An individual or family shall not be housed in a floodplain or wetland (except in existing resources) unless the Regional Administrator has complied with the provisions of § 9.11 to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands. The following provisions shall be substituted for the provisions of § 9.11(d) for mobile homes:

(i) No mobile home or readily fabricated dwelling may be placed on a private or commercial site unless it is elevated to the fullest extent practicable up to the base flood level and adequately anchored.

###### et seq.)

(ii) No mobile home or readily fabricated dwelling may be placed if such placement is inconsistent with the criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain management standard. Such standards may require elevation to the base flood level in the absence of a variance.

(iii) Mobile homes shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill where practicable.

(iv) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:

(A) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in placing mobile homes for temporary housing in floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;

(B) Provide adequate access and egress to and from the proposed site of the mobile home; and

(C) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood and rapid-rise areas.

(5) FEMA shall comply with Step 2 Early Public Notice (§ 9.8(c)) and Step 7 Final Public Notice (§ 9.12). In providing these notices, the emergency nature of temporary housing shall be taken into account.

(e) FEMA shall not sell or otherwise dispose of mobile homes or other readily fabricated dwellings which would be located in floodways or coastal high hazard areas. FEMA shall not sell or otherwise dispose of mobile homes or other readily fabricated dwellings which would be located in floodplains or wetlands unless there is full compliance with the 8-step process. Given the vulnerability of mobile homes to flooding, a rejection of a non-floodplain location alternative and of the no-action alternative shall be based on (1) a compelling need of the family or individual to buy a mobile home for permanent housing, and (2) a compelling requirement to locate the unit in a floodplain. Further, FEMA shall not sell or otherwise dispose of mobile homes or other readily fabricated dwellings in a floodplain unless they are elevated at least to the level of the 100-year flood. The Regional Administrator shall notify the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation of each instance where a floodplain location has been found to be the only practicable alternative for a mobile home sale.

##### § 9.14 Disposal of Agency property.

(a) The purpose of this section is to set forth the procedures whereby the Agency shall dispose of property.

(b) Prior to its disposal by sale, lease or other means of disposal, property proposed to be disposed of by the Agency shall be reviewed according to the decision-making process set out in § 9.6 of this part, as follows:

(1) The property shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of § 9.7 to determine if it affects or is affected by a floodplain or wetland;

(2) The public shall be notified of the proposal and involved in the decision-making process in accordance with the provisions of § 9.8;

(3) Practicable alternatives to disposal shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of § 9.9. For disposals, this evaluation shall focus on alternative actions (conveyance for an alternative use that is more consistent with the floodplain management and wetland protection policies set out in § 9.2 than the one proposed, e.g., open space use for park or recreational purposes rather than high intensity uses), and on the "no action" option (retain the property);

(4) Identify the potential impacts and support associated with the disposal of the property in accordance with § 9.10;

(5) Identify the steps necessary to minimize, restore, preserve and enhance in accordance with § 9.11. For disposals, this analysis shall address all four of these components of mitigation where unimproved property is involved, but shall focus on minimization through floodproofing and restoration of natural values where improved property is involved;

(6) Reevaluate the proposal to dispose of the property in light of its exposure to the flood hazard and its natural values-related impacts, in accordance with § 9.9. This analysis shall focus on whether it is practicable in light of the findings from §§ 9.10 and 9.11 to dispose of the property, or whether it must be retained. If it is determined that it is practicable to dispose of the property, this analysis shall identify the practicable alternative that best achieves all of the components of the Orders' mitigation responsibility;

(7) To the extent that it would decrease the flood hazard to lives and property, the Agency shall, wherever practicable, dispose of the properties according to the following priorities:

(i) Properties located outside the floodplain;

(ii) Properties located in the flood fringe; and

(iii) Properties located in a floodway, regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area.

(8) The Agency shall prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation in accordance with § 9.12.

(9) The Agency shall ensure that the applicable mitigation requirements are fully implemented in accordance with § 9.11.

(c) At the time of disposal, for all disposed property, the Agency shall reference in the conveyance uses that are restricted under existing Federal, State and local floodplain management and wetland protection standards relating to flood hazards and floodplain and wetland values.

##### § 9.15 Planning programs affecting land use.

The Agency shall take floodplain management into account when formulating or evaluating any water and land use plans. No plan may be approved unless it:

(a) Reflects consideration of flood hazards and floodplain management and wetlands protection; and

(b) Prescribes planning procedures to implement the policies and requirements of the Orders and this regulation.

##### § 9.16 Guidance for applicants.

(a) The Agency shall encourage and provide adequate guidance to applicants for agency assistance to evaluate the effects of their plans and proposals in or affecting floodplains and wetlands.

(b) This shall be accomplished primarily through amendment of all Agency instructions to applicants, e.g., program handbooks, contracts, application and agreement forms, etc., and also through contact made by agency staff during the normal course of their activities, to fully inform prospective applicants of:

(1) The Agency's policy on floodplain management and wetlands protection as set out in § 9.2;

(2) The decision-making process to be used by the Agency in making the determination of whether to provide the required assistance as set out in § 9.6;

(3) The nature of the Orders' practicability analysis as set out in § 9.9;

(4) The nature of the Orders' mitigation responsibilities as set out in § 9.11;

(5) The nature of the Orders' public notice and involvement process as set out in §§ 9.8 and 9.12; and

(6) The supplemental requirements applicable to applications for the lease or other disposal of Agency owned properties set out in § 9.14.

(c) Guidance to applicants shall be provided where possible, prior to the time of application in order to minimize potential delays in process application due to failure of applicants to recognize and reflect the provisions of the Orders and this regulation.

##### § 9.17 Instructions to applicants.

###### Purpose.

(a)In accordance with Executive Orders 11988 and 11990, the Federal executive agencies must respond to a number of floodplain management and wetland protection responsibilities before carrying out any of their activities, including the provision of Federal financial and technical assistance. The purpose of this section is to put applicants for Agency assistance on notice concerning both the criteria that it is required to follow under the Orders, and applicants' responsibilities under this regulation.

###### Responsibilities of Applicants.,Guidance for Implementing E.O. 11988,

##### Subpart C [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Personnel Claims Regulations

###### § 11.70 Scope and purpose.

(a) The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3721 to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of officers and employees of FEMA, amounting to not more than $25,000 for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Property may be replaced in-kind at the option of the Government. Claims are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall determine to be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is reasonable, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the type and quantity of property involved, circumstances attending acquisition and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service.

(b) The Government does not underwrite all personal property losses that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. If individuals possess excessive quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property privately insured. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim under this subpart.

###### § 11.71 Claimants.

(a) A claim pursuant to this subpart may only be made by: (1) An employee of FEMA; (2) a former employee of FEMA whose claim arises out of an incident occurring before his/her separation from FEMA; (3) survivors of a person named in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, in the following order of precedence: (i) Spouse; (ii) children; (iii) father or mother, or both or (iv) brothers or sisters, or both; (4) the authorized agent or legal representative of a person named in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.

(b) A claim may not be presented by or for the benefit of a subrogee, assignee, conditional vendor, or other third party.

###### § 11.72 Time limitations.

(a) A claim under this part may be allowed only if it is in writing, specifies a sum certain and is received in the Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472: (1) Within 2 years after it accrues; (2) or if it cannot be filed within the time limits of paragraph (a)(1) of this section because it accrues in time of war or in time of armed conflict in which any armed force of the United States is engaged or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after the claim accrues, when the claimant shows good cause, the claim may be filed within 2 years after the cause ceases to exist but not more than 2 years after termination of the war or armed conflict.

(b) For purposes of this subpart, a claim accrues at the time of the accident or incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage should have been discovered by the claimant by the exercise of due diligence.

###### § 11.73 Allowable claims.

(a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his/her agent, the members of his/her family, or his/her private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and (2) the possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and (3) the claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.

(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.

(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with FEMA may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed, unless excluded by § 11.74.

(ii) Any warehouse, office, working area, or other place (except quarters) authorized for the reception or storage of property.

(iv) When stolen from the quarters of the claimant where it is conclusively shown that the money was in a locked container and that the quarters themselves were locked. Exceptions to the foregoing "double lock" rule are permitted when the adjudicating authority determines that the theft loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, their agent, or their employee. The adjudicating authority should use the test of whether the claimant did their best under the circumstances to protect the property; or

(v) When taken by force from the claimant's person.

####### Clothing.

(6)Claims may be allowed for clothing and accessories customarily worn on the person which are damaged or lost:

(iii) Amounts may be obligated or expended for claims under this section only to the extent provided in advance in appropriation laws.

###### § 11.74 Claims not allowed.

####### Fees for estimates.

(16)Claims are not normally payable for fees paid to obtain estimates of repair in conjunction with submitting a claim under this subpart. However, where, in the opinion of the adjudicating authority, the claimant could not obtain an estimate without paying a fee, such a claim may be considered in an amount reasonable in relation to the value for the cost of repairs of the articles involved, provided that the evidence furnished clearly indicates that the amount of the fee paid will not be deducted from the cost of repairs if the work is accomplished by the estimator.

####### Items fraudulently claimed.

(17)Claims are not payable for items fraudulently claimed.

However, if the remainder of the claim is proper, it may be paid. This does not preclude appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.

####### Minimum amount.

###### § 11.75 Claims involving carriers and insurers.

In the event the property which is the subject of a claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:

(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost, or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.

(1) If more than one bill of lading or contract was issued, a separate demand should be made against the last carrier on each such document.

(2) The demand should be made within the time limit provided in the policy and prior to the filing of a claim against the Government.

(3) If it is apparent that the damage or loss is attributable to packing, storage, or unpacking while in the custody of the Government, no demand need be made against the carrier.

(b) Whenever property which is damaged, lost, or destroyed incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the concurrent claim against the Government.

(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer, had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.

(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit a claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer.

(1) Upon submission of a claim to the Government, the claimant must certify in the claim that no recovery (or the amount of recovery) has been gained from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.

(2) If the carrier or insurer has not taken final action on the claim against them, by the time the claimant submits a claim to the Government, the claimant will immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to him/her, in care of the Chief Counsel of FEMA.

(3) The claimant shall timely advise the Chief Counsel in writing, of any action which is taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim. On request, the claimant also will furnish such evidence as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim.

(e) When a claim is paid by FEMA, the claimant will assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by claimant, all rights, title, and interest in any claim against the carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the Government is based. After payment of the claim by the Government, the claimant will, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by the claimant from the United States.

(f) When a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before the claim against the Government under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows:

(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation is allowable under this subpart.

(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of such total loss;

(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f) the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the $25,000 maximum set forth above. However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds $25,000, the claimant will be allowed only $25,000.

###### § 11.76 Claims procedures.

####### Filing a claim.

(a)Applicants shall file claims in writing with the Chief Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472. Each written claim shall contain, as a minimum:

(1) Name, address, and place of employment of the claimant;

(2) Place and date of the damage or loss:

(3) A brief statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the damage or loss;

In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 16.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

###### Historic preservation programs.

(2)In meeting the requirements of § 16.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 16.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include-

(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

###### Transition plan.

(d)In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum-

(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 16.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

##### Subpart B - Activities by Own Employees

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 18.205 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, "professional and technical services" shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 18.210 Reporting.

No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

##### Subpart C - Activities by Other Than Own Employees

###### § 18.300 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) The reporting requirements in § 18.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, "professional and technical services" shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

##### Subpart D - Penalties and Enforcement

###### § 18.400 Penalties.

(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

###### § 18.405 Penalty procedures.

Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

###### § 18.410 Enforcement.

The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.

##### Subpart E - Exemptions

###### § 18.500 Secretary of Defense.

(a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

OMB shall provide detailed specifications in a memorandum to these agencies.

(g) Non-major agencies are requested to provide machine-readable compilations to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

(h) Agencies shall keep the originals of all disclosure reports in the official files of the agency.

###### § 18.605 Inspector General report.

###### § 59.2 Description of program.

(a) The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 was enacted by title XIII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-448, August 1, 1968) to provide previously unavailable flood insurance protection to property owners in flood-prone areas. Mudslide (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969). Flood-related erosion (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, December 31, 1973). The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 requires the purchase of flood insurance on and after March 2, 1974, as a condition of receiving any form of Federal or federally-related financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes with respect to insurable buildings and mobile homes within an identified special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard area that is located within any community participating in the Program. The Act also requires that on and after July 1, 1975, or one year after a community has been formally notified by the Federal Insurance Administrator. of its identification as community containing one or more special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard areas, no such Federal financial assistance, shall be provided within such an area unless the community in which the area is located is then participating in the Program, subject to certain exceptions. See FIA published Guidelines at § 59.4(c).

(b) To qualify for the sale of federally-subsidized flood insurance a community must adopt and submit to the Federal Insurance Administrator as part of its application, flood plain management regulations, satisfying at a minimum the criteria set forth at part 60 of this subchapter, designed to reduce or avoid future flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion damages. These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.

(c) Minimum requirements for adequate flood plain management regulations are set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, in § 60.4 for mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas and in § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas. Those applicable requirements and standards are based on the amount of technical information available to the community.

###### § 59.3 Emergency program.

The 1968 Act required a risk study to be undertaken for each community before it could become eligible for the sale of flood insurance. Since this requirement resulted in a delay in providing insurance, the Congress, in section 408 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969), established an Emergency Flood Insurance Program as a new section 1336 of the National Flood Insurance Act (42 U.S.C. 4056) to permit the early sale of insurance in flood-prone communities. The emergency program does not affect the requirement that a community must adopt adequate flood plain management regulations pursuant to part 60 of this subchapter but permits insurance to be sold before a study is conducted to determine risk premium rates for the community. The program still requires upon the effective date of a FIRM the charging of risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements and for higher limits of coverage for existing structures.

(c) Population of community and intensity of existing or proposed development of the flood plain, the mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and the flood-related erosion area;

(d) Availability of information on the community with respect to its flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion characteristics and previous losses;

(e) Extent of State and local progress in flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) area and flood-related erosion area management, including adoption of flood plain management regulations consistent with related ongoing programs in the area.

###### § 59.24 Suspension of community eligibility.

(a) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance shall be subject to suspension from the Program for failing to submit copies of adequate flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of § 60.3 or paragraph (b) of § 60.4 or § 60.5, within six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data upon which the flood plain regulations for the applicable paragraph shall be based. Where there has not been any submission by the community, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community that 90 days remain in the six month period in order to submit adequate flood plain management regulations. Where there has been an inadequate submission, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community of the specific deficiencies in its submitted flood plain management regulations and inform the community of the amount of time remaining within the six month period. If, subsequently, copies of adequate flood plain management regulations are not received by the Administrator, no later than 30 days before the expiration of the original six month period the Federal Insurance Administrator shall provide written notice to the community and to the state and assure publication of the community's loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method, such suspension to become effective upon the expiration of the six month period. Should the community remedy the defect and the Federal Insurance Administrator receive copies of adequate flood plain management regulations within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. If the Federal Insurance Administrator receives notice from the State that it has enacted adequate flood plain management regulations for the community within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. The community's eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(b) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be subject to probation. Probation shall represent formal notification to the community that the Federal Insurance Administrator regards the community's flood plain management program as not compliant with NFIP criteria. Prior to imposing probation, the Federal Insurance Administrator (1) shall inform the community upon 90 days prior written notice of the impending probation and of the specific program deficiencies and violations relative to the failure to enforce, (2) shall, at least 60 days before probation is to begin, issue a press release to local media explaining the reasons for and the effects of probation, and (3) shall, at least 90 days before probation is to begin, advise all policyholders in the community of the impending probation and the additional premium that will be charged, as provided in this paragraph, on policies sold or renewed during the period of probation. During this 90-day period the community shall have the opportunity to avoid probation by demonstrating compliance with Program requirements, or by correcting Program deficiencies and remedying all violations to the maximum extent possible. If, at the end of the 90-day period, the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that the community has failed to do so, the probation shall go into effect. Probation may be continued for up to one year after the community corrects all Program deficiencies and remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible. Flood insurance may be sold or renewed in the community while it is on probation. Where a policy covers property located in a community placed on probation on or after October 1, 1986, but prior to October 1, 1992, an additional premium of $25.00 shall be charged on each such policy newly issued or renewed during the one-year period beginning on the date the community is placed on probation and during any successive one-year periods that begin prior to October 1, 1992. Where a community's probation begins on or after October 1, 1992, the additional premium described in the preceding sentence shall be $50.00, which shall also be charged during any successive one-year periods during which the community remains on probation for any part thereof. This $50.00 additional premium shall further be charged during any successive one-year periods that begin on or after October 1, 1992, where the preceding one-year probation period began prior to October 1, 1992.

(c) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce its flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 and does not correct its Program deficiencies and remedy all violations to the maximum extent possible in accordance with compliance deadlines established during a period of probation shall be subject to suspension of its Program eligibility. Under such circumstances, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall grant the community 30 days in which to show cause why it should not be suspended. The Federal Insurance Administrator may conduct a hearing, written or oral, before commencing suspensive action. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. In the event of impending suspension, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall issue a press release to the local media explaining the reasons and effects of the suspension. The community's eligibility shall only be reinstated by the Federal Insurance Administrator upon his receipt of a local legislative or executive measure reaffirming the community's formal intent to adequately enforce the flood plain management requirements of this subpart, together with evidence of action taken by the community to correct Program deficiencies and remedy to the maximum extent possible those violations which caused the suspension. In certain cases, the Federal Insurance Administrator, in order to evaluate the community's performance under the terms of its submission, may withhold reinstatement for a period not to exceed one year from the date of his receipt of the satisfactory submission or place the community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which repeals its flood plain management regulations, allows its regulations to lapse, or amends its regulations so that they no longer meet the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be suspended from the Program. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibly for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. The community eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(e) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance may withdraw from the Program by submitting to the Federal Insurance Administrator a copy of a legislative action that explicitly states its desire to withdraw from the National Flood Insurance Program. Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final legislative action, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall withdraw the community from the Program and publish its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. A community that has withdrawn from the Program may be reinstated if its submits the application materials specified in § 59.22(a).

(f) If during a period of ineligibility under paragraphs (a), (d), or (e) of this section, a community has permitted actions to take place that have aggravated existing flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood related erosion hazards, the Federal Insurance Administrator may withhold reinstatement until the community submits evidence that it has taken action to remedy to the maximum extent possible the increased hazards. The Federal Insurance Administrator may also place the reinstated community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.

(g) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall promptly notify the servicing company and any insurers issuing flood insurance pursuant to an arrangement with the Federal Insurance Administrator of those communities whose eligibility has been suspended or which have withdrawn from the program. Flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed in those communities. Policies sold or renewed within a community during a period of ineligibility are deemed to be voidable by the Federal Insurance Administrator whether or not the parties to sale or renewal had actual notice of the ineligibility.

#### PART 60 - CRITERIA FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND USE

##### Subpart A - Requirements for Flood Plain Management Regulations

###### § 60.1 Purpose of subpart.

(a) The Act provides that flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed under the program within a community, unless the community has adopted adequate flood plain management regulations consistent with Federal criteria. Responsibility for establishing such criteria is delegated to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(b) This subpart sets forth the criteria developed in accordance with the Act by which the Federal Insurance Administrator will determine the adequacy of a community's flood plain management regulations. These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances or codes. Except as otherwise provided in § 60.6, the adequacy of such regulations shall be determined on the basis of the standards set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, § 60.4 for mudslide areas and § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas.

(c) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as modifying or replacing the general requirement that all eligible communities must take into account flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use.

(d) The criteria set forth in this subpart are minimum standards for the adoption of flood plain management regulations by flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and flood-related erosion-prone communities. Any community may exceed the minimum criteria under this part by adopting more comprehensive flood plain management regulations utilizing the standards such as contained in subpart C of this part. In some instances, community officials may have access to information or knowledge of conditions that require, particularly for human safety, higher standards than the minimum criteria set forth in subpart A of this part. Therefore, any flood plain management regulations adopted by a State or a community which are more restrictive than the criteria set forth in this part are encouraged and shall take precedence.

###### § 60.2 Minimum compliance with flood plain management criteria.

(a) A flood-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.3(a) in order to become eligible if a FHBM has not been issued for the community at the time of application. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data set forth in § 60.3 (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), in which to meet the requirements of the applicable paragraph. If a community has received a FHBM, but has not yet applied for Program eligibility, the community shall apply for eligibility directly under the standards set forth in § 60.3(b). Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data set forth in § 60.3 (c), (d), (e) or (f) in which to meet the requirements of the applicable paragraph.

(b) A mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.4(a) to become eligible. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas having special mudslide hazards are delineated in which to meet the requirements of § 60.4(b).

(c) A flood-related erosion-prone community applying for flood insurance eligibility shall meet the standards of § 60.5(a) to become eligible. Thereafter, the community will be given a period of six months from the date the flood-related erosion areas having special erosion hazards are delineated in which to meet the requirements of § 60.5(b).

(d) Communities identified in part 65 of this subchapter as containing more than one type of hazard (e.g., any combination of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazard areas) shall adopt flood plain management regulations for each type of hazard consistent with the requirements of §§ 60.3, 60.4 and 60.5.

(e) Local flood plain management regulations may be submitted to the State Coordinating Agency designated pursuant to § 60.25 for its advice and concurrence. The submission to the State shall clearly describe proposed enforcement procedures.

(f) The community official responsible for submitting annual or biennial reports to the Federal Insurance Administrator pursuant to § 59.22(b)(2) of this subchapter shall also submit copies of each annual or biennial report to any State Coordinating Agency.

(g) A community shall assure that its comprehensive plan is consistent with the flood plain management objectives of this part.

(h) The community shall adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations based on data provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Without prior approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator, the community shall not adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations based upon modified data reflecting natural or man-made physical changes.

###### § 60.3 Flood plain management criteria for flood-prone areas.

The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood hazard area designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special flood hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data formally provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:

(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not defined the special flood hazard areas within a community, has not provided water surface elevation data, and has not provided sufficient data to identify the floodway or coastal high hazard area, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall:

(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community, including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas;

(2) Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;

(3) Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall (i) be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and (iv) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(4) Review subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area, (ii) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;

(5) Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and

(6) Require within flood-prone areas (i) new and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and (ii) onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has designated areas of special flood hazards (A zones) by the publication of a community's FHBM or FIRM, but has neither produced water surface elevation data nor identified a floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:

(1) Require permits for all proposed construction and other developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;

(2) Require the application of the standards in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section to development within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;

(3) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data;

(4) Obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM meet the standards in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6), (c)(12), (c)(14), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section;

(5) Where base flood elevation data are utilized, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM:

(i) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures, and

(ii) Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed, and

(iii) Maintain a record of all such information with the official designated by the community under § 59.22 (a)(9)(iii);

(6) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to the Federal Insurance Administrator;

(7) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;

(8) Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

(c) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final flood elevations for one or more special flood hazard areas on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated other special flood hazard areas without base flood elevations on the community's FIRM, but has not identified a regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:

(1) Require the standards of paragraph (b) of this section within all A1-30 zones, AE zones, A zones, AH zones, and AO zones, on the community's FIRM;

(2) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's FIRM have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level, unless the community is granted an exception by the Federal Insurance Administrator for the allowance of basements in accordance with § 60.6 (b) or (c);

(3) Require that all new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the community's firm (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

(4) Provide that where a non-residential structure is intended to be made watertight below the base flood level, (i) a registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (c)(8)(ii) of this section, and (ii) a record of such certificates which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained with the official designated by the community under § 59.22(a)(9)(iii);

(5) Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

(6) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites

(i) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,

(ii) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,

(iii) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or

(iv) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation collapse and lateral movement.

(7) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);

(8) Require within any AO zone on the community's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures (i) have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or (ii) together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing standard specified in § 60.3(c)(3)(ii);

(9) Require within any A99 zones on a community's FIRM the standards of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4)(i) and (b)(5) through (b)(9) of this section;

(10) Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

(11) Require within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(12) Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A-1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(6) of this section be elevated so that either

(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or

(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may approve certain development in Zones Al-30, AE, and AH, on the community's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision, fulfills the requirements for such a revision as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(14) Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either

(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,

(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or

(iii) Meet the permit requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.

(d) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AO zones, AH zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has provided data from which the community shall designate its regulatory floodway, the community shall:

(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (14) of this section;

(2) Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point;

(3) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;

(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(e) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AH zones, AO zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has identified on the community's FIRM coastal high hazard areas by designating Zones V1-30, VE, and/or V, the community shall:

(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (14) of this section;

(3) Provide that all new construction within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM is located landward of the reach of mean high tide;

(4) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V1-30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation data is available, on the community's FIRM, are elevated on pilings and columns so that (i) the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; and (ii) the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of paragraphs (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section.

(5) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community's FIRM have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or State codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

(i) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and,

(ii) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural).

###### § 60.4 Flood plain management criteria for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas.

The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard area designations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases, the minimum requirements for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:

(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not yet identified any area within the community as an area having special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall

(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community so that it may determine whether development is proposed within mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas;

(2) Require review of each permit application to determine whether the proposed site and improvements will be reasonably safe from mudslides (i.e., mudflows). Factors to be considered in making such a determination should include but not be limited to (i) the type and quality of soils, (ii) any evidence of ground water or surface water problems, (iii) the depth and quality of any fill, (iv) the overall slope of the site, and (v) the weight that any proposed structure will impose on the slope;

(3) Require, if a proposed site and improvements are in a location that may have mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards, that (i) a site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering, (ii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvements are adequately designed and protected against mudslide (i.e., mudflow) damages, (iii) the proposed grading, excavations, new construction and substantial improvements do not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances, and (iv) drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance be such as not to endanger slope stability.

(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated Zone M on the community's FIRM, the community shall:

(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and

(2) Adopt and enforce a grading ordinance or regulation in accordance with data supplied by the Federal Insurance Administrator which (i) regulates the location of foundation systems and utility systems of new construction and substantial improvements, (ii) regulates the location, drainage and maintenance of all excavations, cuts and fills and planted slopes, (iii) provides special requirements for protective measures including but not necessarily limited to retaining walls, buttress fills, sub-drains, diverter terraces, benchings, etc., and (iv) requires engineering drawings and specifications to be submitted for all corrective measures, accompanied by supporting soils engineering and geology reports. Guidance may be obtained from the provisions of the 1973 edition and any subsequent edition of the Uniform Building Code, sections 7001 through 7006, and 7008 through 7015. The Uniform Building Code is published by the International Conference of Building Officials, 50 South Los Robles, Pasadena, California 91101.

###### § 60.5 Flood plain management criteria for flood-related erosion-prone areas.

The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations for flood-related erosion-prone areas shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources, pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood-related erosion hazard area designations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator they shall apply. The symbols defining such special flood-related erosion hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-related erosion-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:

(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not yet identified any area within the community as having special flood-related erosion hazards, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall

(1) Require the issuance of a permit for all proposed construction, or other development in the area of flood-related erosion hazard, as it is known to the community;

(2) Require review of each permit application to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing flood-related erosion hazard; and

(3) If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or to increase the erosion hazard, require the improvement to be relocated or adequate protective measures to be taken which will not aggravate the existing erosion hazard.

(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated Zone E on the community's FIRM, the community shall

(1) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and

(2) Require a setback for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water, to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer will be designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in conjunction with the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic and climatic characteristics of the community's land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only.

###### § 60.6 Variances and exceptions.

(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator does not set forth absolute criteria for granting variances from the criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, and 60.5. The issuance of a variance is for flood plain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The community, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre (as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. The Federal Insurance Administrator may review a community's findings justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management, the Federal Insurance Administrator may take appropriate action under § 59.24(b) of this subchapter. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. Procedures for the granting of variances by a community are as follows:

(1) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;

(2) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures of paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section;

(3) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;

(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;

(5) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in paragraph (a)(6) of this section; and

(6) A community shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(7) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(b)(1) The requirement that each flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone, and flood-related erosion prone community must adopt and submit adequate flood plain management regulations as a condition of initial and continued flood insurance eligibility is statutory and cannot be waived, and such regulations shall be adopted by a community within the time periods specified in § 60.3, § 60.4 or § 60.5. However, certain exceptions from the standards contained in this subpart may be permitted where the Federal Insurance Administrator recognizes that, because of extraordinary circumstances, local conditions may render the application of certain standards the cause for severe hardship and gross inequity for a particular community. Consequently, a community proposing the adoption of flood plain management regulations which vary from the standards set forth in § 60.3, § 60.4, or § 60.5, shall explain in writing to the Federal Insurance Administrator the nature and extent of and the reasons for the exception request and shall include sufficient supporting economic, environmental, topographic, hydrologic, and other scientific and technical data, and data with respect to the impact on public safety and the environment.

(2) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall prepare a Special Environmental Clearance to determine whether the proposal for an exception under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will have significant impact on the human environment. The decision whether an Environmental Impact Statement or other environmental document will be prepared, will be made in accordance with applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy. Ninety or more days may be required for an environmental quality clearance if the proposed exception will have significant impact on the human environment thereby requiring an EIS.

(c) A community may propose flood plain management measures which adopt standards for floodproofed residential basements below the base flood level in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE which are not subject to tidal flooding. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section the Federal Insurance Administrator may approve the proposal provided that:

(1) The community has demonstrated that areas of special flood hazard in which basements will be permitted are subject to shallow and low velocity flooding and that there is adequate flood warning time to ensure that all residents are notified of impending floods. For the purposes of this paragraph flood characteristics must include:

(i) Flood depths that are five feet or less for developable lots that are contiguous to land above the base flood level and three feet or less for other lots;

(ii) Flood velocities that are five feet per second or less; and

(iii) Flood warning times that are 12 hours or greater. Flood warning times of two hours or greater may be approved if the community demonstrates that it has a flood warning system and emergency plan in operation that is adequate to ensure safe evacuation of flood plain residents.

(2) The community has adopted flood plain management measures that require that new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures with basements in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE shall:

(i) Be designed and built so that any basement area, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities below the floodproofed design level, is watertight with walls that are impermeable to the passage of water without human intervention. Basement walls shall be built with the capacity to resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy resulting from flooding to the floodproofed design level, and shall be designed so that minimal damage will occur from floods that exceed that level. The floodproofed design level shall be an elevation one foot above the level of the base flood where the difference between the base flood and the 500-year flood is three feet or less and two feet above the level of the base flood where the difference is greater than three feet.

(ii) Have the top of the floor of any basement area no lower than five feet below the elevation of the base flood;

(iii) Have the area surrounding the structure on all sides filled to or above the elevation of the base flood. Fill must be compacted with slopes protected by vegetative cover;

(iv) Have a registered professional engineer or architect develop or review the building's structural design, specifications, and plans, including consideration of the depth, velocity, and duration of flooding and type and permeability of soils at the building site, and certify that the basement design and methods of construction proposed are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this paragraph;

(v) Be inspected by the building inspector or other authorized representative of the community to verify that the structure is built according to its design and those provisions of this section which are verifiable.

###### § 60.7 Revisions of criteria for flood plain management regulations.

From time to time part 60 may be revised as experience is acquired under the Program and new information becomes available. Communities will be given six months from the effective date of any new regulation to revise their flood plain management regulations to comply with any such changes.

###### § 60.8 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in part 59 of this subchapter are applicable to this part.

##### Subpart B - Requirements for State Flood Plain Management Regulations

###### § 60.11 Purpose of this subpart.

(a) A State is considered a "community" pursuant to § 59.1 of this subchapter; and, accordingly, the Act provides that flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed under the Program unless a community has adopted adequate flood plain management regulations consistent with criteria established by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(b) This subpart sets forth the flood plain management criteria required for State-owned properties located within special hazard areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator. A State shall satisfy such criteria as a condition to the purchase of a Standard Flood Insurance Policy for a State-owned structure or its contents, or as a condition to the approval by the Federal Insurance Administrator, pursuant to part 75 of this subchapter, of its plan of self-insurance.

###### § 60.12 Flood plain management criteria for State-owned properties in special hazard areas.

(a) The State shall comply with the minimum flood plain management criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, and 60.5. A State either shall:

(1) Comply with the flood plain management requirements of all local communities participating in the program in which State-owned properties are located; or

(2) Establish and enforce flood plain management regulations which, at a minimum, satisfy the criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, and 60.5.

(b) The procedures by which a state government adopts and administers flood plain management regulations satisfying the criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and 60.5 may vary from the procedures by which local governments satisfy the criteria.

(c) If any State-owned property is located in a non-participating local community, then the State shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the property.

###### § 60.13 Noncompliance.

If a State fails to submit adequate flood plain management regulations applicable to State-owned properties pursuant to § 60.12 within six months of the effective date of this regulation, or fails to adequately enforce such regulations, the State shall be subject to suspensive action pursuant to § 59.24. Where the State fails to adequately enforce its flood plain management regulations, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall conduct a hearing before initiating such suspensive action.

##### Subpart C - Additional Considerations in Managing Flood-Prone, Mudslide (i.e., Mudflow)-Prone and Flood-Related Erosion-Prone Areas

###### § 60.21 Purpose of this subpart.

The purpose of this subpart is to encourage the formation and adoption of overall comprehensive management plans for flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and flood-related erosion-prone areas. While adoption by a community of the standards in this subpart is not mandatory, the community shall completely evaluate these standards.

(14) Requirement of setbacks for new construction within Zones V1-30, VE, and V on a community's FIRM;

(15) Requirement of additional elevation above the base flood level for all new construction and substantial improvements within Zones A1-30, AE, V1-30, and VE on the community's FIRM to protect against such occurrences as wave wash and floating debris, to provide an added margin of safety against floods having a magnitude greater than the base flood, or to compensate for future urban development;

(16) Requirement of consistency between state, regional and local comprehensive plans and flood plain management programs;

(17) Requirement of pilings or columns rather than fill, for the elevation of structures within flood-prone areas, in order to maintain the storage capacity of the flood plain and to minimize the potential for negative impacts to sensitive ecological areas;

(18) Prohibition, within any floodway or coastal high hazard area, of plants or facilities in which hazardous substances are manufactured.

(19) Requirement that a plan for evacuating residents of all manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas be developed and filed with and approved by appropriate community emergency management authorities.

###### § 60.23 Planning considerations for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas.

#### PART 61 - INSURANCE COVERAGE AND RATES

##### § 61.1 Purpose of part.

This part describes the types of properties eligible for flood insurance coverage under the Program, the limits of such coverage, and the premium rates actually to be paid by insureds.

##### § 61.2 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in part 59 of this subchapter are applicable to this part.

##### § 61.3 Coverage and benefits provided under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

(a) Insurance coverage under the Program is available for buildings and their contents. Coverage for each may be purchased separately.

(b) In addition to building and contents coverage, the Dwelling Form of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) covers debris removal, loss avoidance measures, and condominium loss assessments. The General Property Form of the SFIP covers debris removal, loss avoidance measures, and pollution damage. The Residential Condominium Building Association Policy Form of the SFIP covers debris removal and loss avoidance measures.

(c) With the purchase of building coverage, the Standard Flood Insurance Policy covers the costs associated with bringing the building into compliance with local floodplain ordinances.

##### § 61.4 Special terms and conditions.

###### i.e.,

(a) No new flood insurance or renewal of flood insurance policies will be written for properties declared by a duly constituted State or local zoning or other authority to be in violation of any floodplain, mudslide (mudflow), or flood-related erosion area management or control law, regulation, or ordinance.

(b) In order to reduce the administrative costs of the Program, of which the Federal Government pays a major share, applicants must pay the full policy premium at the time of application.

##### § 61.5 Deductibles.

FEMA must provide policyholders with deductible options in various amounts, up to and including $10,000, subject to the following minimum deductible amounts:

(a) The minimum deductible for policies covering pre-FIRM buildings charged less than full-risk rates with building coverage amounts less than or equal to $100,000 is $1,500.

(b) The minimum deductible for policies covering pre-FIRM buildings charged less than full-risk rates with building coverage amounts greater than $100,000 is $2,000.

(c) The minimum deductible for policies covering post-FIRM buildings and pre-FIRM buildings charged full risk rates, with building coverage amounts equal to or less than $100,000 is $1,000.

(b) Coverage and benefits payable under the SFIP pursuant to § 61.3(b) and (c) are included in, not in addition to, the coverage limits provided by the Act or stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

##### § 61.7 Risk premium rate determinations.

(a) Pursuant to section 1307 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator is authorized to undertake studies and investigations to enable him/her to estimate the risk premium rates necessary to provide flood insurance in accordance with accepted actuarial principles, including applicable operating costs and allowances. Such rates are also referred to in this subchapter as "actuarial rates."

(b) The Federal Insurance Administrator is also authorized to prescribe by regulation the rates which can reasonably be charged to insureds in order to encourage them to purchase the flood insurance made available under the Program. Such rates are referred to in this subchapter as "chargeable rates." For areas having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazards, chargeable rates are usually lower than actuarial rates.

##### § 61.8 Applicability of risk premium rates.

Risk premium rates are applicable to all flood insurance made available for:

(a) Any structure, the construction or substantial improvement of which was started after December 31, 1974 or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM, whichever is later.

(b) Coverage which exceeds the following limits:

(1) For dwelling properties in States other than Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, and Guam (i) $35,000 aggregate liability for any property containing only one unit, (ii) $100,000 for any property containing more than one unit, and (iii) $10,000 liability per unit for any contents related to such unit.

(2) For dwelling properties in Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, and Guam (i) $50,000 aggregate liability for any property containing only one unit, (ii) $150,000 for property containing more than one unit, and (iii) $10,000 aggregate liability per unit for any contents related to such unit.

(c) Any structure or the contents thereof for which the chargeable rates prescribed by this part would exceed the risk premium rates.

##### § 61.9 Establishment of chargeable rates.

(a) Under section 1308 of the Act, we are establishing annual chargeable rates for each $100 of flood insurance coverage as follows for Pre-FIRM, A zone properties, Pre-FIRM, V-zone properties, and emergency program properties.

(b) We will charge rates for contents in pre-FIRM buildings according to the use of the building.

(c) A-zone rates for buildings without basements or enclosures apply uniformly to all buildings throughout emergency program communities.

(d) Properties that meet the definition of Severe Repetitive Loss properties as defined in § 79.2(g) of this subchapter, and who refuse an offer of mitigation pursuant to § 79.7 of this subchapter are not eligible for the rates identified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

(e) Properties leased from the Federal Government and located either on the river-facing side of a dike, levee, or other riverine flood control structure, or seaward of any seawall or other coastal flood control structure are not eligible for the rates identified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

##### § 61.10 Requirements for issuance or renewal of flood insurance coverage.

FEMA will not issue or renew flood insurance unless FEMA receives:

(a) The full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees); and

(b) A complete application, including the information necessary to establish a premium rate for the policy, or submission of corrected or additional information necessary to calculate the premium for the renewal of the policy.

##### § 61.11 Effective date and time of coverage under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy - New Business Applications and Endorsements.

(a) During the 13-month period beginning on the effective date of a revised Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map for a community, the effective date and time of any initial flood insurance coverage shall be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the first calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 2.

(b) Where the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the making, increasing, extension, or renewal of a loan, the coverage with respect to the property which is the subject of the loan shall be effective as of the time of the loan closing, provided the written request for the coverage is received by the NFIP and the flood insurance policy is applied for and the presentment of payment of premium is made at or prior to the loan closing.

(c) Where the following conditions are met, the effective date and time of any initial purchase of flood insurance coverage for any privately-owned property will be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the first calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium:

(1) The Administrator has determined that the property is affected by flooding on Federal land that is a result of, or is exacerbated by, post-wildfire conditions, after consultation with an authorized employee of the Federal agency that has jurisdiction of the land on which the wildfire that caused the post-wildfire conditions occurred; and

(2) The flood insurance coverage was purchased not later than 60 calendar days after the fire containment date, as determined by the appropriate Federal employee, relating to the wildfire that caused the post-wildfire conditions described in clause (1).

(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the effective date and time of any new policy, added coverage, or increase in the amount of coverage will be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the 30th calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 31.

(e) Adding new coverage or increasing the amount of coverage in force is permitted during the term of any policy, subject to any applicable waiting periods. The additional premium for any new coverage or increase in the amount of coverage will be calculated pro rata in accordance with the rates currently in force.

###### endorsement,application

(f) With respect to any submission of an application in connection with new business, the payment by an insured to an agent or the issuance of premium payment by the agent does not constitute payment to the NFIP. Therefore, it is important that an application for flood insurance, as well as the full amount due, be mailed to the NFIP promptly in order to have the effective date of the coverage based on the application date plus the waiting period. If the application and the full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP within ten (10) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application. Also, as an alternative, in those cases where the application and premium payment are mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application even though the application and full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP after ten (10) calendar days following the date of application. Thus, if the application and premium payment are received after ten (10) calendar days from the date of the application or are not mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of receipt at the office of the NFIP. To determine the effective date of any coverage added by endorsement to a flood insurance policy already in effect, substitute the termfor the termin this paragraph (f).

(g) The rules set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section apply to Write Your Own (WYO) companies, except that agents must mail the premium payments and accompanying applications and endorsements to the WYO company and the WYO company must receive the applications and endorsements, rather than the NFIP.

##### § 61.12 Rates based on a flood protection system involving Federal funds.

(a) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community has made adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system involving Federal funds which will significantly limit the area of special flood hazards, the applicable risk premium rates for any property, located within a special flood hazard area intended to be protected directly by such system will be those risk premium rates which would be applicable when the system is complete.

(b) Adequate progress in paragraph (a) of this section means that the community has provided information to the Federal Insurance Administrator sufficient to determine that substantial completion of the flood protection system has been effected because:

(1) 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been authorized;

(2) At least 60 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated;

(3) At least 50 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been expended;

(4) All critical features of the flood protection system, as identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator, are under construction, and each critical feature is 50 percent completed as measured by the actual expenditure of the estimated construction budget funds; and

(5) The community has not been responsible for any delay in the completion of the system.

(c) Each request by a community for a determination must be submitted in writing to the Risk Analysis Division, Mitigation Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington DC, and contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the flood protection system, including, but not limited to, supporting technical data (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood protection project data), cost schedules, budget appropriation data and the extent of Federal funding of the system's construction. Such facts shall include information sufficient to identify all persons affected by such flood protection system or by such request: A full and precise statement of intended purposes of the flood protection system; and a carefully detailed description of such project, including construction completion target dates. In addition, true copies of all contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents involved must be submitted with the request. Relevant facts reflected in documents, however, must be included in the statement and not merely incorporated by reference, and must be accompanied by an analysis of their bearing on the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, specifying the pertinent provisions. The request must contain a statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the person responsible for preparing the application for the community, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and the purpose of that litigation. The request must also contain a statement as to whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, detailing the disposition of such previous request. As documents become part of the file and cannot be returned, the original documents should not be submitted.

(d) The effective date for any risk premium rates established under this section shall be the date of final determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator that adequate progress toward completion of a flood protection system has been made in a community.

(e) A responsible official of a community which received a determination that adequate progress has been made towards completion of a flood protection system shall certify to the Federal Insurance Administrator annually on the anniversary date of receipt of such determination that no present delay in completion of the system is attributable to local sponsors of the system, and that a good faith effort is being made to complete the project.

(f) A community for which risk premium rates have been made available under section 1307(e) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator if, at any time, all progress on the completion of the flood protection system has been halted or if the project for the completion of the flood protection system has been canceled.

##### § 61.13 Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

###### Incorporation of forms.

(a)Each of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy forms included in appendix "A" hereto (General Property, Dwelling, and Residential Condominium Building Association) and by reference incorporated herein shall be incorporated into the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

###### Endorsements.

(b)All endorsements to the Standard Flood Insurance Policy shall be final upon publication in thefor inclusion in appendix A.

###### Applications.

(c)The application and renewal application forms utilized by the National Flood Insurance Program shall be the only application forms used in connection with the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

###### Waivers.

(d)The Standard Flood Insurance Policy and required endorsements must be used in the Flood Insurance Program, and no provision of the said documents shall be altered, varied, or waived other than by the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator through the issuance of an appropriate amendatory endorsement, approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator as to form and substance for uniform use.

###### Authorized only under terms and conditions established by the Act and Regulation.

(e)The Standard Flood Insurance Policy is authorized only under terms and conditions established by Federal statute, the program's regulations, the Federal Insurance Administrator's interpretations, and the express terms of the policy itself. Accordingly, representations regarding the extent and scope of coverage that are not consistent with Federal statute, the program's regulations, the Federal Insurance Administrator's interpretations, and the express terms of the policy itself, are void.

###### Agent acts only for policyholder.

(f)The duly licensed property or casualty agent acts for the policyholder and does not act as agent for the Federal Government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Write Your Own (WYO) program participating insurance company authorized by part 62 of this chapter, or the NFIP servicing agent.

###### Oral and written binders.

(g)No oral binder or contract will be effective. No written binder will be effective unless issued with express authorization of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(h) The Standard Flood Insurance Policy and endorsements may be issued by private sector Write Your Own (WYO) property insurance companies, based upon flood insurance applications and renewal forms, all of which instruments of flood insurance may bear the name, as Insurer, of the issuing WYO company. In the case of any Standard Flood Insurance Policy, and its related forms, issued by a WYO company, wherever the names "Federal Emergency Management Agency" and "Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration" appear, a WYO company must substitute its own name therefore. Standard Flood Insurance Policies issued by WYO companies may be executed by the issuing WYO company as Insurer, in the place and stead of the Federal Insurance Administrator, but the risk of loss is borne by the National Flood Insurance Fund, not the WYO company.

##### § 61.14 Standard Flood Insurance Policy Interpretations.

###### Definition.

(a)A Standard Flood Insurance Policy Interpretation is a written determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator construing the scope of the flood insurance coverage that has been and is provided under the policy.

###### Publication and requests for interpretation.

(b)The Federal Insurance Administrator shall, pursuant to these regulations from time to time, issue interpretative rulings regarding the provisions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy. Such Interpretations shall be published in themade a part of appendix C to these regulations, and incorporated by reference as part of these regulations. Any policyholder or person in privity with a policyholder may file a request for an interpretation in writing with the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472.

##### § 61.16 Probation additional premium.

The additional premium charged pursuant to § 59.24(b) on each policy sold or renewed within a community placed on probation prior to October 1, 1992, is $25.00. Where the community was placed on probation on or after October 1, 1992, the additional premium charge is $50.00."

##### § 61.17 Group Flood Insurance Policy.

(a) A Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) is a policy covering all individuals named by a State as recipients under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174) of an Individuals and Households Program (IHP) award for flood damage as a result of major disaster declaration by the President.

(b) The premium for the GFIP is a flat fee of $600 per insured. We may adjust the premium to reflect NFIP loss experience and any adjustment of benefits under the IHP program.

(c) The amount of coverage is equivalent to the maximum grant amount established under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174).

(d) The term of the GFIP is for 36 months and begins 60 days after the date of the disaster declaration.

(e) Coverage for individual grantees begins on the thirtieth day after the NFIP receives the required data for individual grantees and their premium payments.

(f) We will send a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each individual insured under the GFIP.

(g) The GFIP is the Standard Flood Insurance Policy Dwelling Form (a copy of which is included in appendix A(1) of this part), except that:

(1) VI. DEDUCTIBLES does not apply to the GFIP. A special deductible of $200 (applicable separately to any building loss and any contents loss) applies to insured flood-damage losses sustained by the insured property in the course of any subsequent flooding event during the term of the GFIP. The deductible does not apply to:

(i) III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or

(ii) III. C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments coverage.

(2) VIII. POLICY NULLIFICATION, CANCELLATION, AND NON-RENEWAL, C. Cancellation of the Policy by You, does not apply to the GFIP.

(3) VII. GENERAL CONDITIONS, E. Policy Renewal, does not apply to the GFIP.

(h) We will send a notice to the GFIP certificate holders approximately 60 days before the end of the thirty-six month term of the GFIP. The notice will encourage them to contact a local insurance agent or producer or a private insurance company selling NFIP policies under the Write Your Own program of the NFIP Standard Flood Insurance Policy, and advise them as to the amount of coverage they must maintain in order not to jeopardize their eligibility for future disaster assistance. The IHP program will provide the NFIP the amount of flood insurance coverage to be maintained by certificate holders.

The policy will also cover improvements made or acquired solely at your expense in the dwelling or apartment in which you reside, but for not more than 10 percent of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.

7. If you are the owner of a unit and have insured personal property under Coverage B in this policy, we will also cover your interior walls, floor, and ceiling (not otherwise insured under a flood insurance policy purchased by your condominium association) for not more than 10 percent of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page.

(iv) Plastic sheeting and lumber used in connection with these items.

(b) The value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, that you or a member of your household perform.

(2) This coverage for Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor only applies if damage to insured property by or from flood is imminent and the threat of flood damage is apparent enough to lead a person of common prudence to anticipate flood damage. One of the following must also occur:

(a) A general and temporary condition of flooding in the area near the described location must occur, even if the flood does not reach the building; or

(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.

This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.

(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.

(3) Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b and c, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.

(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

a. Subject to III.C.3.b below, if this policy insures a condominium unit, we will pay, up to the Coverage A limit of liability, your share of loss assessments charged against you by the condominium association in accordance with the condominium association's articles of association, declarations and your deed. The assessment must be made because of direct physical loss by or from flood during the policy term, to the unit or to the common elements of the NFIP insured condominium building in which this unit is located.

b. We will not pay any loss assessment:

(1) Charged against you and the condominium association by any governmental body;

(2) That results from a deductible under the insurance purchased by the condominium association insuring common elements;

(3) That results from a loss to personal property, including contents of a condominium building;

(4) In which the total payment combined under all policies exceeds the maximum amount of coverage available under the Act for a single unit in a condominium building where the unit is insured under both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP; or

(5) On any item of damage that has already been paid under a RCBAP where a single unit in a condominium building is insured by both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP.

c. Condominium Loss Assessment coverage does not increase the Coverage A Limit of Liability and is subject to the maximum coverage limits available for a single-family dwelling under the Act, payable between all policies issued and covering the unit, under the Act.

This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:

a. Non-residential buildings.

b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6(b) or (c)].

We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A-Building Property and Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.

a. A building insured under Coverage A-Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:

(1) Be a "repetitive loss building." A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:

(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.

(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.

(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.

(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or

(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.

b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:

(1) 3.a.1 above.

(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.

###### i.e.,

(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local "free-board" requirements,that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.

c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are eligible for Coverage D.

d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Coverage D Exclusion 5.g below.

e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.

a. When a building insured under Coverage A-Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.

b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.

Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), we will not pay for:

a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.

b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.

c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.

d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:

(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and

(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.

###### e.g.,

f. Any code upgrade requirements,plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.

h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.

i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.

j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.

k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.

l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.

a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the 80 percent insurance-to-value requirement for replacement cost coverage as set forth in Art. VII.R ("Loss Settlement") of this policy.

b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.

We do not insure any of the following:

1. Personal property not inside a building.

2. A building, and personal property in it, located entirely in, on, or over water or seaward of mean high tide if it was constructed or substantially improved after September 30, 1982.

3. Open structures, including a building used as a boathouse or any structure or building into which boats are floated, and personal property located in, on, or over water.

###### see

4. Recreational vehicles other than travel trailers described in the Definitions section (II.C.6.c) whether affixed to a permanent foundation or on wheels.

10. Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.

11. Buildings or units and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.

12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.

13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.

14. Hot tubs and spas that are not bathroom fixtures, and swimming pools, and their equipment, such as, but not limited to, heaters, filters, pumps, and pipes, wherever located.

15. Property not eligible for flood insurance pursuant to the provisions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act and amendments to these acts.

16. Personal property you own in common with other unit owners comprising the membership of a condominium association.

A. We only pay for direct physical loss by or from flood, which means that we do not pay you for:

1. Loss of revenue or profits;

2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;

3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;

4. Loss from interruption of business or production;

5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;

6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance; or

7. Any other economic loss you suffer.

###### Flood in Progress.

B.If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the full amount due. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 61.11(f).

C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:

1. Earthquake;

2. Landslide;

3. Land subsidence;

4. Sinkholes;

5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land area; or

6. Gradual erosion.

###### see

We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (II.B.1.c and II.B.2).

D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following:

1. The pressure or weight of ice;

2. Freezing or thawing;

3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;

4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:

a. Substantially confined to the dwelling; or

b. That is within your control, including but not limited to:

(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;

(2) Failure, stoppage, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or

(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;

5. Water or water-borne material that:

a. Backs up through sewers or drains;

b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or

c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property;

6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;

7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;

8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;

9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspire to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or

10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.

E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.

F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.

A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.

However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.

B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.

C. The deductible does NOT apply to:

1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures;

2. III.C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments; or

3. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.

In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:

1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or

2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.

1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:

a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.

b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.

c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.

2. If there is other insurance issued under the Act in the name of your condominium association covering the same property insured by this policy, then this policy will be in excess over the other insurance, except where a condominium loss assessment to the unit owner results from a loss sustained by the condominium association that was not reimbursed under a flood insurance policy written in the name of the association under the Act because the building was not, at the time of loss, insured for an amount equal to the lesser of:

a. 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost; or

b. The maximum amount of insurance permitted under the Act.

The combined coverage payment under the other NFIP insurance and this policy cannot exceed the maximum coverage available under the Act, of $250,000 per single unit.

This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:

a. When this policy insures only personal property; or

b. When this policy insures a building under construction.

1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.

2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.

a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.

b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.

c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.

3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:

a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.

(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pays the additional premium amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).

(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.

(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.

b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.

(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.

(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.

4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b.

5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.

1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.

2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.

###### e.g.,

3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:

a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.

b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.

4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.

We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.

In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:

1. Give prompt written notice to us.

2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.

3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.

4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:

a. The date and time of loss;

b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;

c. Your interest (for example, "owner") and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;

d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;

e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;

f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;

g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;

h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and

i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.

5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.

6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.

7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.

8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.

9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.

Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:

1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:

a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;

b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and

c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:

(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;

(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and

(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.

2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:

a. Quantities and costs;

b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);

c. Amounts of loss claimed;

d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and

e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.

3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:

a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and

b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.

No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.

1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:

a. We reach an agreement with you;

b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or

c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.

2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:

a. Accept our denial of your claim;

b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or

c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.

You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured under this policy.

We may permit you to keep damaged property insured under this policy after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.

If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.

Each party will:

1. Pay its own appraiser; and

2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

1. The word "mortgagee" includes trustee.

2. Any loss payable under Coverage A-Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.

3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:

a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;

b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and

c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.

4. All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.

5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.

6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.

7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.

You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year after the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.

Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.

1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:

a. To make no further claim under this policy;

b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;

c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;

d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.

If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.

2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A "closed basin lake" is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:

a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.

b. Before approval of your claim, you must:

(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and

(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes" to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and

(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.

c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.

d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.

e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:

(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;

(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and

(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b above.

f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes."

g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any in-creased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.

h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:

(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and

(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.

This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in paragraphs a-c below.

a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in R.2 below, applies to a single-family dwelling provided:

(1) It is your principal residence; and

(2) At the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the dwelling is 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss, or is the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.

b. Special Loss Settlement, described in R.3 below, applies to a single-family dwelling that is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer.

c. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement applies to a single-family dwelling not subject to replacement cost or special loss settlement, and to the property listed in R.4 below.

The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling described in R.1.a above:

a. We will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:

(1) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page;

(2) The replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged, with materials of like kind and quality and for like use; or

(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use.

b. If the dwelling is rebuilt at a new location, the cost described above is limited to the cost that would have been incurred if the dwelling had been rebuilt at its former location.

c. When the full cost of repair or replacement is more than $1,000, or more than 5 percent of the whole amount of insurance that applies to the dwelling, we will not be liable for any loss under R.2.a above or R.4.a.2 below unless and until actual repair or replacement is completed.

d. You may disregard the replacement cost conditions above and make claim under this policy for loss to dwellings on an actual cash value basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to R.2.a, b, and c above, provided you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the date of loss.

e. If the community in which your dwelling is located has been converted from the Emergency Program to the Regular Program during the current policy term, then we will consider the maximum amount of available NFIP insurance to be the amount that was available at the beginning of the current policy term.

a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling that:

(1) is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer, as defined in II.C.6.b and c;

(2) is at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has an area of at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled; and

(3) is your principal residence as specified in R.1.a.1 above.

b. If such a dwelling is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damage condition, we will, at our discretion pay the least of the following amounts:

(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the dwelling or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or

(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.

c. If such a dwelling is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damage condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost conditions in R.2 above.

The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value (or in the case of R.4.a.2., below, proportional) loss settlement.

a. A dwelling, at the time of loss, when the amount of insurance on the dwelling is both less than 80 percent of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss and less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP. In that case, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the amount of insurance that applies to that dwelling:

(1) The actual cash value, as defined in II.C.2, of the damaged part of the dwelling; or

(2) A proportion of the cost to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling, without deduction for physical depreciation and after application of the deductible.

This proportion is determined as follows: If 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the amount of insurance that represents 80 percent of its full replacement cost. But if 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is greater than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.

b. A two-, three-, or four-family dwelling.

c. A unit that is not used exclusively for single-family dwelling purposes.

d. Detached garages.

e. Personal property.

f. Appliances, carpets, and carpet pads.

g. Outdoor awnings, outdoor antennas or aerials of any type, and other outdoor equipment.

h. Any property insured under this policy that is abandoned after a loss and remains as debris anywhere on the described location.

i. A dwelling that is not your principal residence.

To determine the amount of insurance required for a dwelling immediately before the loss, we do not include the value of:

a. Footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor and support all or part of the dwelling;

b. Those supports listed in R.5.a above, that are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls if there is no basement; and

c. Excavations and underground flues, pipes, wiring, and drains.

###### Note:

The Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance limit of liability is not included in the determination of the amount of insurance required.

1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:

a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;

b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or

c. Made false statements.

2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.

3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.

4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.

1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:

a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;

b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;

c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;

d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or

e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.

2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.

1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.

2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.

a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:

(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.

(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.

b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies

a. Except as allowed under Article I.G, your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.

b. Except as allowed under Article I.G, if the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.

c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to VIII.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

4. Cancellation Due to Physical Alteration of Property

a. If the insured building has been physically altered in such a manner that it is no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage, we will cancel this policy.

b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

Your policy will not be renewed if:

1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;

2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;

3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.

If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.

###### et seq.

This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,), and Federal common law.

###### In Witness Whereof,

a. walls,

b. floors, and

c. ceilings,

This coverage does not increase the amount of insurance that applies to insured personal property.

10. If you are a tenant, personal property must be inside the fully enclosed building.

a. We will pay the expense to remove non-owned debris that is on or in insured property and debris of insured property anywhere.

b. If you or a member of your household perform the removal work, the value of your work will be based on the Federal minimum wage.

(iii) Pumps; and

(iv) Plastic sheeting and lumber used in connection with these items.

(b) The value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, that you perform.

(a) A general and temporary condition of flooding in the area near the described location must occur, even if the flood does not reach the building; or

(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.

This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

b. Property Removed to Safety

(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.

(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.

(3) Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.

(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

We will pay for damage caused by pollutants to insured property if the discharge, seepage, migration, release, or escape of the pollutants is caused by or results from flood. The most we will pay under this coverage is $10,000. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limits of liability. Any payment under this provision when combined with all other payments for the same loss cannot exceed the replacement cost or actual cash value, as appropriate, of the insured property. This coverage does not include the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.

This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:

a. Non-residential buildings.

b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6(b) or (c)].

We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. However, the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A (Building Property) and Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do NOT charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.

a. A building insured under Coverage A (Building Property) sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:

(1) Be a "repetitive loss building." A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:

(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.

(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.

(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.

(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or

(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.

b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:

(1) 3.a.1 above.

(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.

###### i.e.,

(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local "free-board" requirements,that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.

c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.

d. This coverage will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to the exclusion at III.D.5.g.

e. This coverage will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.

a. When a building insured under Coverage A-Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.

b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.

Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), we will not pay for:

a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.

b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.

c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.

d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:

(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and

(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.

###### e.g.,

f. Any code upgrade requirements,plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.

h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.

i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.

j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.

k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.

l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.

All other conditions and provisions of the policy apply.

We do not insure any of the following property:

1. Personal property not inside the fully enclosed building.

2. A building, and personal property in it, located entirely in, on, or over water or seaward of mean high tide if it was constructed or substantially improved after September 30, 1982.

10. Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.

11. Buildings or units and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.

12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.

13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.

14. Hot tubs and spas that are not bathroom fixtures, and swimming pools, and their equipment, such as, but not limited to, heaters, filters, pumps, and pipes, wherever located.

15. Property not eligible for flood insurance pursuant to the provisions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act and amendments to these Acts.

16. Personal property owned by or in the care, custody or control of a unit owner, except for property of the type and under the circumstances set forth under III. Coverage B-Personal Property of this policy.

17. A residential condominium building located in a Regular Program community.

A. We only pay for "direct physical loss by or from flood," which means that we do not pay you for:

1. Loss of revenue or profits;

2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;

3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;

4. Loss from interruption of business or production;

5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;

6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance; or

7. Any other economic loss you suffer.

###### Flood in Progress.

B.If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the correct premium. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 611.11(f).

C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:

1. Earthquake;

2. Landslide;

3. Land subsidence;

4. Sinkholes;

5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or

6. Gradual erosion.

###### see

We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (II.B.1.c and II.B.2).

D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:

1. The pressure or weight of ice;

2. Freezing or thawing;

3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;

4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:

a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or

b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:

(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;

(2) Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or

(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;

5. Water or water-borne material that:

a. Backs up through sewers or drains;

b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or

c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property;

unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;

6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;

7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;

8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;

9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspires to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or

10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.

E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.

A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.

However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.

B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.

C. The deductible does NOT apply to:

1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or

2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.

In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:

1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or

2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.

1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:

a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c below applies.

b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.

c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.

2. Where this policy insures a condominium association and there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that insures the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.

This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy can constitute a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:

1. When this policy insures only personal property; or

2. When this policy insures a building under construction.

1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.

2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1 and VII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.

a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.

b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.

c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.

3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:

a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.

(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).

(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.

(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.

b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.

(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.

(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.

4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b is provided.

5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.

1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.

2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.

###### e.g.,

3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:

a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.

b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.

4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.

We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.

In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:

1. Give prompt written notice to us.

2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.

3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.

4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:

a. The date and time of loss;

b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;

c. Your interest (for example, "owner") and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;

d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;

e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;

f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;

g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;

h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and

i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.

5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.

6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.

7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.

8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.

9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.

Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:

1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:

a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;

b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and

c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:

(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;

(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and

(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.

2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:

a. Quantities and costs;

b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);

c. Amounts of loss claimed;

d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and

e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.

3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:

a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and

b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.

No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.

1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:

a. We reach an agreement with you;

b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or

c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.

2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:

a. Accept our denial of your claim;

b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or

c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.

You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.

We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.

If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss.

Each party will:

1. Pay its own appraiser; and

2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

1. The word "mortgagee" includes trustee.

2. Any loss payable under Coverage A-Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.

3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:

a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;

b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and

c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.

4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.

5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.

6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.

7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.

You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.

Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.

1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:

a. To make no further claim under this policy;

b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;

c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;

d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.

If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.

2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A "closed basin lake" is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:

a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.

b. Before approval of your claim, you must:

(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and

(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes" to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and

(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.

c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.

d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.

e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:

(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;

(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and

(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b. above.

f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes."

g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.

h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:

(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and

(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.

We will pay the least of the following amounts after application of the deductible:

1. The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;

2. The actual cash value; or

3. The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.

1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:

a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;

b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or

c. Made false statements.

2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.

3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.

4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.

1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:

a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;

b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;

c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;

d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or

e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.

2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.

1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.

2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.

a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:

(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.

(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.

b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies.

a. Your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.

b. If the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.

c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to VIII.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

4. Cancellation Due to Physical Alteration of Property

a. If the insured building has been physically altered in such a manner that it is no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage, we will cancel this policy.

b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

Your policy will not be renewed if:

1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;

2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;

3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.

If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.

###### et seq.

This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,), and Federal common law.

##### Appendix A(3) to Part 61

Please read the policy carefully. The flood insurance provided is subject to limitations, restrictions, and exclusions.

A. This policy insures only a residential condominium building in a regular program community. If the community reverts to emergency program status during the policy term and remains as an emergency program community at time of renewal, this policy cannot be renewed.

B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:

1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);

2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and

3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.

D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.

E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.

F. Subject to the exception in Section I.G below, multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A-Building Property.

G. A Dwelling Form policy with building coverage may be issued to a unit owner in a condominium building that is also insured under a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP). However, no more than $250,000 may be paid in combined benefits for a single unit under the Dwelling Form and the RCBAP. We will only pay for damage once. Items of damage paid for under a RCBAP cannot also be claimed under the Dwelling Form policy.

A. In this policy, "you" and "your" refer to the named insured(s) shown on the Declarations Page of this policy. The named insured must also include the building owner if building coverage is purchased. Insured(s) includes: Any mortgagee and loss payee named in the Application and Declarations Page, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to have an existing interest at the time of loss, in the order of precedence. "We," "us," and "our" refer to the insurer.

c. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for costs you incur to protect the insured building from a flood or imminent danger of flood, for the following:

(a) Your reasonable expenses to buy:

(i) Sandbags, including sand to fill them;

(ii) Fill for temporary levees;

(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.

This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.

(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there.

(3) The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements. Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b and c, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.

(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.

This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:

a. Non-residential buildings.

b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6 (b) or (c)].

We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But, the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A-Building Property and Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.

a. A building insured under Coverage A (Building Property) sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:

(1) Be a "repetitive loss building." A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:

(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.

(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.

(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.

(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or

(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.

b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:

(1) 3.a.1 above.

(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.

###### i.e.,

(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local "freeboard" requirements,that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.

c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.

d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g below relating to improvements.

e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.

a. When a building insured under Coverage A-Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.

b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.

Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) we will not pay for:

a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.

b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.

c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.

d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:

(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and

(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.

###### e.g.,

f. Any code upgrade requirements,plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.

g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.

h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.

i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.

j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.

k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.

l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.

a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the coinsurance requirement for replacement cost coverage under Art. VIII.R. ("Loss Settlement").

b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.

We do not insure any of the following:

1. Personal property not inside a building.

2. A building, and personal property in it, located entirely in, on, or over water or seaward of mean high tide if it was constructed or substantially improved after September 30, 1982.

3. Open structures, including a building used as a boathouse or any structure or building into which boats are floated, and personal property located in, on, or over water.

4. Recreational vehicles other than travel trailers described in the Definitions section (see II.C.6.c) whether affixed to a permanent foundation or on wheels.

5. Self-propelled vehicles or machines, including their parts and equipment. However, we do cover self-propelled vehicles or machines not licensed for use on public roads that are:

a. Used mainly to service the described location; or

b. Designed and used to assist handicapped persons, while the vehicles or machines are inside a building at the described location.

6. Land, land values, lawns, trees, shrubs, plants, growing crops, or animals.

7. Accounts, bills, coins, currency, deeds, evidences of debt, medals, money, scrip, stored value cards, postage stamps, securities, bullion, manuscripts, or other valuable papers.

8. Underground structures and equipment, including wells, septic tanks, and septic systems.

9. Those portions of walks, walkways, decks, driveways, patios, and other surfaces, all whether protected by a roof or not, located outside the perimeter, exterior walls of the insured building.

10. Containers, including related equipment, such as, but not limited to, tanks containing gases or liquids.

11. Buildings and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.

12. Fences, retaining walls, seawalls, bulkheads, wharves, piers, bridges, and docks.

13. Aircraft or watercraft, or their furnishings and equipment.

14. Hot tubs and spas that are not bathroom fixtures, and swimming pools, and their equipment such as, but not limited to, heaters, filters, pumps, and pipes, wherever located.

15. Property not eligible for flood insurance pursuant to the provisions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and the Coastal Barrier Improvements Act of 1990 and amendments to these Acts.

16. Personal property used in connection with any incidental commercial occupancy or use of the building.

A. We only pay for "direct physical loss by or from flood," which means that we do not pay you for:

1. Loss of revenue or profits;

2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;

3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;

4. Loss from interruption of business or production;

5. Any additional living expenses incurred while the insured building is being repaired or is unable to be occupied for any reason;

6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D-Increased Cost of Compliance; or

7. Any other economic loss you suffer.

###### Flood in Progress.

B.If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the correct premium. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 611.11(f).

C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:

1. Earthquake;

2. Landslide;

3. Land subsidence;

4. Sinkholes;

5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or

6. Gradual erosion.

###### see

We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically covered under our definition of flood (II.B.1.c and II.B.2).

D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:

1. The pressure or weight of ice;

2. Freezing or thawing;

3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;

4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:

a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or

b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:

(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;

(2) Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or

(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;

5. Water or water-borne material that:

a. Backs up through sewers or drains;

b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or

c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property; unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;

6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;

7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;

8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;

9. Anything you or your agents do or conspire to do to cause loss by flood deliberately; or

10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.

E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.

F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.

A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.

However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.

B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.

C. No deductible applies to:

1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or

2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.

A. This Coinsurance Section applies only to coverage on the building.

B. We will impose a penalty on loss payment unless the amount of insurance applicable to the damaged building is:

1. At least 80 percent of its replacement cost; or

2. The maximum amount of insurance available for that building under the NFIP, whichever is less.

C. If the actual amount of insurance on the building is less than the required amount in accordance with the terms of VII.B above, then loss payment is determined as follows (subject to all other relevant conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to valuation, adjustment, settlement, and payment of loss):

1. Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the building by the required amount of insurance.

2. Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the deductible, by the figure determined in C.1 above.

3. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in C.2 above.

We will pay the amount determined in C.3 above, or the amount of insurance carried, whichever is less. The amount of insurance carried, if in excess of the applicable maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, is reduced accordingly.

We will pay no more than $134,500. The remaining $15,500 is not covered due to the coinsurance penalty ($15,000) and application of the deductible ($500).

In this example there is no coinsurance penalty, because the actual amount of insurance carried meets the required amount. We will pay no more than $199,500 ($200,000 amount of loss minus the $500 deductible).

D. In calculating the full replacement cost of a building:

1. The replacement cost value of any insured building property will be included;

2. The replacement cost value of any building property not insured under this policy will not be included; and

3. Only the replacement cost value of improvements installed by the condominium association will be included.

In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:

1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or

2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.

1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:

a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VIII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.

b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.

c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VIII.B.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.

2. If there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.

This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:

1. When this policy insures only personal property; or

2. When this policy insures a building under construction.

1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.

2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VIII.D.1 and VIII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.

a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.

b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VIII.E.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.

c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.

3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VIII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:

a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.

(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).

(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.

(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.

b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.

(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VIII.D.3.a above.

(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.

4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amount requested in VIII.D.3.a or VIII.D.4.a, or the additional information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b.

5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of IX.A apply.

1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.

2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.

###### e.g.,

3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake,we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:

a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.

b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.

c. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.

We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.

In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:

1. Give prompt written notice to us.

2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.

3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.

4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:

a. The date and time of loss;

b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;

c. Your interest (for example, "owner") and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;

d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;

e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;

f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;

g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;

h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and

i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.

5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.

6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.

7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.

8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.

9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.

Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:

1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:

a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;

b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and

c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:

(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;

(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, and rules and regulations; and

(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.

2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:

a. Quantities and costs;

b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);

c. Amounts of loss claimed;

d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and

e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.

3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:

a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and

b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.

No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.

1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:

a. We reach an agreement with you;

b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or

c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VIII.M.

2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:

a. Accept our denial of your claim;

b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or

c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.

You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.

We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.

If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.

Each party will:

1. Pay its own appraiser; and

2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

1. The word "mortgagee" includes trustee.

2. Any loss payable under Coverage A-Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.

3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:

a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;

b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and

c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.

4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.

5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.

6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.

7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.

You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.

Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.

1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:

a. To make no further claim under this policy;

b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;

c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;

d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.

If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.

2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or this paragraph Q.2 (A "closed basin lake" is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:

a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.

b. Before approval of your claim, you must:

(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and

(2) Grant the conservation easement contained in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes," to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and

(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.

c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.

d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.

e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:

(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;

(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and

(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above.

f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's "Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes."

g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.

h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:

(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q2.e and Q.2.f above; and

(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.

This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in a-c below.

(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the manufactured home or travel trailer or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or

(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.

c. If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damaged condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost Loss Settlement conditions in R.2 above.

###### et seq.

This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001,), and Federal common law.

###### In Witness Whereof,

we have signed this policy below and hereby enter into this Insurance Agreement.

#### PART 62 - SALE OF INSURANCE AND ADJUSTMENT OF CLAIMS

##### Subpart A - Issuance of Policies

###### § 62.1 Purpose of part.

The purpose of this part is to set forth the manner in which flood insurance under the Program is made available to the general public in those communities designated as eligible for the sale of insurance under part 64 of this subchapter, and to prescribe the general method by which the Federal Insurance Administrator exercises his/her responsibility regarding the manner in which claims for losses are paid.

###### § 62.2 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in part 59 of this subchapter are applicable to this part.

###### § 62.3 Servicing agent.

(a) Pursuant to sections 1345 and 1346 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator may enter into an agreement with a servicing agent to authorize it to assist in issuing flood insurance policies under the Program in communities designated by the Federal Insurance Administrator and to accept responsibility for delivery of policies and payment of claims for losses as prescribed by and at the discretion of the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(b) The servicing agent will arrange for the issuance of flood insurance to any person qualifying for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits an application to the servicing agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract between the Agency and the servicing agent.

###### § 62.4 Limitations on sale of policies.

(a) The servicing agent shall be deemed to have agreed, as a condition of its contract that it shall not offer flood insurance under any authority or auspices in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified in § 61.6 of this subchapter, in any area the Federal Insurance Administrator designates in part 64 of this subchapter as eligible for the sale of flood insurance under the Program, other than in accordance with this part, and the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

(b) The agreement and all activities thereunder are subject to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and to the applicable Federal regulations and requirements issued from time to time pursuant thereto. No person shall be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under the Program, on the ground of race, color, sex, creed or national origin. Any complaint or information concerning the existence of any such unlawful discrimination in any matter within the purview of this part should be referred to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

###### § 62.5 Nullifications, cancellations, and premium refunds.

####### Nullification,Property ineligible at time of application.

(a)-(1)FEMA will void a policy for a property that was not eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application from the commencement of the policy. FEMA must pay the policyholder a refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges paid from the date of commencement of the policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the property was ineligible for coverage at the time of the initial application. If FEMA paid a claim for an ineligible property, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA, or offset the payment from the premiums to be refunded, before FEMA will process the refund.

####### Property later becomes ineligible.

(2)FEMA may not renew a policy for a property that was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. In such instances, FEMA must nullify the policy from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible. FEMA must refund all premium, fees, and surcharges paid from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the property was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. If FEMA paid a claim for a property after it became ineligible for coverage, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA or FEMA must offset the amount of claim payment from the premiums to be refunded before FEMA may process the refund.

####### Nullification prior to policy effective date.

(3)If FEMA nullifies a policy prior to the policy effective date, that policy will be void from the commencement of the nullified policy term. In such case, FEMA will refund all premium, fees, and surcharges paid for the current policy term only. If FEMA paid a claim for a policy that was improperly issued, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA or FEMA must offset the amount of claim payment from the premiums to be refunded before the NFIP may process the refund.

####### Cancellation due to lack of an insurable interest.

(b)If the policyholder had an insurable interest, but no longer has an insurable interest, in the insured property, FEMA must cancel the policy on the insured property. If FEMA cancels a policy for this reason, FEMA must refund the policyholder a pro rata share of the premium from the date the policyholder lost an insurable interest in the property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. FEMA must pay the policyholder a refund of all fees or surcharges for any full policy term during which the policyholder had no insurable interest in the insured property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. A policyholder ceases to have an insurable interest if:

(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.

(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.

####### No insurance coverage requirement.

(c)A policyholder may cancel a policy if the policyholder was subject to a requirement by a lender, loss payee, or other Federal agency to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to statute, regulation, or contract, but there is no longer such a requirement. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the current policy term only, calculated from the date of the cancellation request, but will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges.

####### Establishment of a common expiration date.

(d)A policyholder may purchase a new policy and cancel an existing policy in order to establish a common expiration date between flood insurance coverage and other coverage. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium calculated from the effective date of the new policy to the end date of the previous policy. The policyholder will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges. In order to rewrite and cancel the policy, the following conditions must apply:

(1) The new policy must be written with the same company for the same or higher amount of coverage. If the policy is written for a higher amount or different type of coverage, the waiting period in § 61.11 will apply.

(2) The other insurance coverage for which the common expiration date is being established must be for coverage on the same building that is insured by the flood policy being cancelled and rewritten.

(3) The coverage for the new policy must be effective prior to cancelling the existing policy.

####### Cancelation or nullification of duplicate NFIP policies,Generally.

(e)-(1)(i) Except as described in 44 CFR 62.5(e)(2), if an insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy not in accordance with applicable regulations and the Standard Flood Insurance Policy, FEMA must nullify the policy with the later effective date. The policy with the earlier effective date will continue. The policyholder will receive a pro rata refund of all premium for the nullified policy from the effective date of the nullified policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy. The policyholder will receive a refund of all fees or surcharges for any full policy term during which the policyholder was insured by more than one policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy.

(ii) If both polices have the same policy effective date, the policyholder may choose which policy will remain in effect, and the policyholder will receive a refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges for the cancelled policy from the effective date of the cancelled policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy.

####### Exceptions.

(2)In the following cases, the policyholder may maintain the policy with the later policy effective date while cancelling the policy with the earlier policy effective date:

(i) The policy with the earlier effective date has expired for more than 30 days. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium, calculated from the effective date of the policy with the later effective date to the end date of the policy with the earlier effective date, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of cancellation. The policyholder will also receive a refund of all fees and surcharges for any full policy terms during which the insured property is insured by both policies, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request.

(ii) The policy with the earlier policy effective date is a Group Flood Insurance Policy. In such cases, there will be no refund of any premium, fees, or surcharges.

(iii) The policy with the earlier effective date is cancelled to establish a common policy expiration date pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In such cases, refunds will be provided in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(iv) The policy with the earlier effective date was force placed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4012a using the NFIP's Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of the pro rata share of the premium calculated from the policy effective date of the new policy to the expiration date of the cancelled policy. There will be no refund of any fees or surcharges.

(v) The policy with the earlier effective date is a Dwelling Form policy with building coverage on a condominium unit that is also insured by a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP) that is issued at the statutory maximum coverage limit for buildings. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the building coverage issued under the Dwelling Form policy, as calculated from the effective date of the RCBAP policy to the end date of the Dwelling Form policy. The policyholder will also receive a refund of all fees and surcharges for any full policy terms during which the condominium unit is insured by both a Dwelling Form policy and an RCBAP in which the coverage equals the statutory maximum coverage limits for buildings, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request.

####### Other cancellations and nullifications.

(f)Except as indicated below, FEMA will not refund premiums, assessments, fees, or surcharges if FEMA cancels a policy for any of the following reasons:

####### Fraud.

(1)FEMA will cancel a policy for fraud committed by the policyholder or the agent. FEMA may cancel a policy for misrepresentation of a material fact by the policyholder or agent. Such cancellations will take effect as of the date of the fraudulent act or material misrepresentation of fact.

####### Administrative cancellation.

(2)FEMA may cancel and rewrite a policy to correct an administrative error, such as when the policy is written with the wrong policy effective date. In such cases, FEMA will apply any premium, assessments, fees, or surcharges to the new policy. FEMA will refund any excess premium, fees, surcharges, or assessments paid.

####### Nullification for properties ineligible due to physical alteration of property.

(3)A policy insuring a building or its contents, or both, may be cancelled if the building has been physically altered in such a manner that the building and its contents are no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the current policy term only, but the policyholder will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges.

###### § 62.6 Brokers and agents writing NFIP policies through the NFIP Direct Servicing Agent.

(a) A broker or agent selling policies of flood insurance placed with the NFIP at the offices of its servicing agent must be duly licensed by the state insurance regulatory authority in the state in which the property is located.

(b) The earned commission which will be paid to any property or casualty insurance agent or broker, with respect to each policy or renewal the agent duly procures on behalf of the insured, in connection with policies of flood insurance placed with the NFIP at the offices of its servicing agent, but not with respect to policies of flood insurance issued pursuant to subpart C of this part, will not be less than $10 and is computed as follows:

(1) In the case of a new or renewal policy, the following commissions shall apply based on the total premiums paid for the policy term:

(2) In the case of mid-term increases in amounts of insurance added by endorsements, the following commissions shall apply based on the total premiums paid for the increased amounts of insurance:

(c) Any refunds of premiums authorized under this subchapter shall not affect a previously earned commission; and no agent shall be required to return that earned commission, unless the refund is made to establish a common policy term anniversary date with other insurance providing coverage against loss by other perils in which case a return of commission will be required by the agent on a pro rata basis. In such cases, the policy shall be immediately rewritten for a new term with the same amount(s) of coverage and with premium calculated at the then current rate and, as to return premium, returned, pro rata, to the insured based on the former policy's premium rate.

##### Subpart C - Write-Your-Own (WYO) Companies

###### § 62.23 WYO Companies authorized.

(a) Pursuant to section 1345 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator may enter into arrangements with individual private sector property insurance companies or other insurers, such as public entity risk sharing organizations. Under these arrangements, such companies or other insurers may offer flood insurance coverage under the program to eligible applicants. Such WYO companies may offer flood coverage to policyholders insured by them under their own property business lines of insurance, pursuant to their customary business practices, including their usual arrangements with agents and producers. WYO companies may sell flood insurance coverage in any State in which the WYO company is authorized to engage in the business of property insurance. Other WYO insurers may offer flood insurance coverage to their pool members insured by them under their own property business lines of coverage, pursuant to their customary business practices. These other WYO insurers may provide flood coverage in any State that has authorized the other insurer to provide property coverage to its members. Arrangements entered into by WYO companies or other insurers under this subpart must be in the form and substance of the standard arrangement, titled "Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement." Each year, at least six months before the effective date of the "Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement," FEMA must publish in theand make available to the WYO companies the terms for subscription or re-subscription to the "Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement."

(b) Any duly authorized insurer so engaged in the Program shall be a WYO Company. (The term "WYO Company" shall include the following kinds of insurers: Public entity risk-sharing organizations, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures.)

(c) A WYO Company is authorized to arrange for the issuance of flood insurance in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified in § 61.6 of this subchapter, as Insurer, to any person qualifying for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits an application to the WYO Company; coverage shall be issued under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

(d) A WYO Company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for the adjustment, settlement, payment and defense of all claims arising from policies of flood insurance it issues under the Program, based upon the terms and conditions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.

(e) In carrying out its functions under this subpart, a WYO Company shall use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act and regulations prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administrator under the Act.

(f) To facilitate the marketing of flood insurance coverage under the Program to policyholders of WYO Companies, the Federal Insurance Administrator will enter into arrangements with such companies whereby the Federal Government will be a guarantor in which the primary relationship between the WYO Company and the Federal Government will be one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately expended. In furtherance of this end, the Federal Insurance Administrator has established "A Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your Own Program."

(g) A WYO Company shall act as a fiscal agent of the Federal Government, but not as its general agent. WYO Companies are solely responsible for their obligations to their insured under any flood insurance policies issued under agreements entered into with the Federal Insurance Administrator, such that the Federal Government is not a proper party defendant in any lawsuit arising out of such policies.

(h) To facilitate the underwriting of flood insurance coverage by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies:

(1) To expedite business growth, the WYO Company will encourage its present property insurance policyholders to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP WYO Program.

(2) To conform its underwriting practices to the underwriting rules and rates in effect as to the NFIP, the WYO Company will establish procedures to carry out the NFIP rating system and provide its policyholders with the same coverage as is afforded under the NFIP.

(3) The WYO Company may follow its customary billing practices to meet the Federal rules on the presentment of premium and net premium deposits to a Letter of Credit bank account authorized by the Federal Insurance Administrator and reduction of coverage when an underpayment is discovered.

(4) The WYO Company is expected to meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan. Transactions reported by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan will be analyzed by the NFIP Bureau & Statistical Agent. A monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions that have not passed systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's reconciliation reports.

(5) If a WYO Company rejects an application from an agent or a producer, the agent or producer shall be notified so that the business can be placed through the NFIP Servicing Agent, or another WYO Company.

(6) Flood insurance coverage will be issued by the WYO Company on a separate policy form and will not be added, by endorsement, to the Company's other property insurance forms.

(7) Premium payment plans can be offered by the WYO Company so long as the net premium depository requirements specified under the NFIP/WYO Program accounting procedures are met. A cancellation by the WYO Company for non-payment of premium will not produce a pro rata return of the net premium deposit to the WYO Company.

(8) NFIP business will not be assumed by the WYO Companies at any time other than at renewal time, at which time the insurance producer may submit the business to the WYO Company as new business. However, it is permissible to cancel and rewrite flood policies to obtain concurrent expiration dates with other policies covering the property.

(i) To facilitate the adjustment of flood insurance claims by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies.

(1) WYO companies will adjust claims in accordance with general company standards, guided by NFIP Claims manuals. The Arrangement provides that claim adjustments shall be binding upon the FIA.

(2) The WYO Company may use its staff adjusters, independent adjusters, or both. It is important that the Company's Claims Department verifies the correctness of the coverage interpretations and reasonableness of the payments recommended by the adjusters.

(3) An established loss adjustment Fee Schedule is part of the Arrangement and cannot be changed during an Arrangement year. This is the expense allowance to cover costs of independent or WYO Company adjusters.

(4) The normal catastrophe claims procedure currently operated by a WYO Company should be implemented in the event of a claim catastrophe situation. Flood claims will be handled along with other catastrophe claims.

(5) It will be the WYO Company's responsibility to try to detect fraud (as it does in the case of property insurance) and coordinate its findings with FIA.

(6) Pursuant to the Arrangement, the responsibility for defending claims will be upon the Write Your Own Company and defense costs will be part of the unallocated or allocated claim expense allowance, depending on whether a staff counsel or an outside attorney handles the defense of the matter. Claims in litigation will be reported by WYO Companies to FIA upon joinder of issue and FIA may inquire and be advised of the disposition of such litigation.

(7) The claim reserving procedures of the individual WYO Company can be used.

(8) Regarding the handling of subrogation, if a WYO Company prefers to forego pursuit of subrogation recovery, it may do so by referring the matter, with a complete copy of the claim file, to FIA. Subrogation initiatives may be truncated at any time before suit is commenced (after commencing an action, special arrangement must bemade). FIA, after consultation with FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC), will forward the cause of action to OCC or to the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent for prosecution. Any funds received will be deposited, less expenses, in the National Flood Insurance Fund.

(9) Special allocated loss adjustment expenses will include such items as: nonstaff attorney fees, engineering fees and special investigation fees over and above normal adjustment practices.

(10) The customary content of claim files will include coverage verification, normal adjuster investigations, including statements where necessary, police reports, building reports and investigations, damage verification and other documentation relevant to the adjustment of claims under the NFIP's and the WYO Company's traditional claim adjustment practices and procedures. The WYO Company's claim examiners and managers will supervise the adjustment of flood insurance claims by staff and independent claims adjusters.

(11) The WYO Company will extend reasonable cooperation to FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel on matters pertaining to litigation and subrogation, under paragraph (i)(8) of this section.

(j) To facilitate establishment of financial controls under the WYO Program, the WYO Company will:

(1) Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial statements conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm at the Company's expense to ensure that the financial data reported to us accurately represents the flood insurance activities of the Company. The CPA firm must conduct its audits in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (commonly known as "yellow book" requirements). The Company must file with us (the Federal Insurance Administration) a report of the CPA firm's detailed biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit report, we will convey our determination to the Standards Committee.

(2) Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims, underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRPP) Plan (Part 5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the Standards Committee.

(3) Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual. Transactions reported to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Bureau and Statistical Agent by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual will be analyzed by the Bureau and Statistical Agent and a monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions which do not pass systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on WYO Company reconciliation reports.

(4) Cooperate with FEMA's Chief Financial Officer on Letter of Credit matters.

(5) Cooperate with FIA in the implementation of a claims reinspection program.

(6) Cooperate with FIA in the verification of risk rating information.

(7) Cooperate with DHS's Office of the Inspector General on matters pertaining to fraud.

(k) To facilitate the operation of the WYO Program and in order that a WYO Company can use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator, for good cause shown, may grant exceptions to and waivers of the regulations contained in this title relative to the administration of the NFIP.

(l)(1) WYO Companies may, on a voluntary basis, elect to participate in the Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP), under which they can offer, as a last resort, flood insurance at special high rates, sufficient to recover the full cost of this program in recognition of the uncertainty as to the degree of risk a given building presents due to the limited underwriting data required, to properties in a lending institution's mortgage portfolio to achieve compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Flood insurance policies under the MPPP may only be issued for those properties that:

(i) Are determined to be located within special flood hazard areas of communities that are participating in the NFIP, and

(ii) Are not covered by a flood insurance policy even after a required series of notices have been given to the property owner (mortgagor) by the lending institution of the requirement for obtaining and maintaining such coverage, but the mortgagor has failed to respond.

(2) WYO Companies participating in the MPPP must provide a detailed implementation package to any lending institution that, on a voluntary basis, chooses to participate in the MPPP to ensure the lending institution has full knowledge of the criteria in that program and must obtain a signed receipt for that package from the lending institution. Participating WYO companies must also maintain evidence of compliance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section for review during the audits and reviews required by the WYO Financial Control Plan.

(3) The mortgagor must be protected against the lending institution's arbitrary placing of flood insurance for which the mortgagor will be billed by being sent three notification letters as described in paragraphs (l)(4) through (6) of this section.

(4) The initial notification letter must:

(i) State the requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended;

(ii) Announce the determination that the mortgagor's property is in an identified special flood hazard area as delineated on the appropriate FEMA map, necessitating flood insurance coverage for the duration of the loan;

(iii) Describe the procedure to follow should the mortgagor wish to challenge the determination;

(iv) Request evidence of a valid flood insurance policy or, if there is none, encourage the mortgagor to obtain a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) promptly from a local insurance agent (or WYO Company);

(v) Advise that the premium for a MPPP policy is significantly higher than a conventional SFIP policy and advise as to the option for obtaining less costly flood insurance; and

(vi) Advise that a MPPP policy will be purchased by the lender if evidence of flood insurance coverage is not received by a date certain.

(5) The second notification letter must remind the mortgagor of the previous notice and provide essentially the same information.

(6) The final notification letter must:

(i) Enclose a copy of the flood insurance policy purchased under the MPPP on the mortgagor's (insured's) behalf, together with the Declarations Page,

(ii) Advise that the policy was purchased because of the failure to respond to the previous notices, and

(iii) Remind the insured that similar coverage may be available at significantly lower cost and advise that the policy can be cancelled at any time during the policy year and a pro rata refund provided for the unearned portion of the premium in the event the insured purchases another policy that is acceptable to satisfy the requirements of the 1973 Act.

###### § 62.24 WYO participation criteria.

New companies or organizations eligible for the pilot project we describe in paragraph (b) of this section that seek to participate in the WYO program, as well as former WYO companies seeking to return to the WYO program, must meet standards for financial capability and stability for statistical and financial reporting and for commitment to program objectives.

Applicants will also name, in addition to a Principal Coordinator, a corporate officer point of contact-an individual, e.g., at the level of Senior Executive Vice President, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer. Each applicant shall furnish the latest available information regarding the number of its fire, allied lines, farm-owners multiple peril, homeowners multiple peril, and commercial multiple peril policies or coverage documents in force, by line.

#### PART 63 - IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 1306(c) OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 63.1 Purpose of part.

The purpose of this part is to implement section 1306(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (the Act). Section 544 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242) amended the Act by adding subsection (c) to section 1306 of the Act. Under this amendment, effective February 5, 1988, section 1306(c) of the Act provides for benefit payments under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) for demolition or relocation of a structure insured under the Act that is located along the shore of a lake or other body of water and that is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. This part establishes criteria by which States can obtain the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator to make these certifications and sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be used by those States in making these certifications. This part also contains provisions regarding other aspects of section 1306(c) of the Act. For example, there are provisions regarding section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act (which provides for condemnation in lieu of certification), including clarification as to the form of condemnation issued under a State or local law that is required.

###### § 63.2 Condemnation in lieu of certification.

(a) The condemnation required by section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act in lieu of certification need not be grounded in a finding that the structure is subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion, but may be issued for other reasons deemed sufficient by the State or local authority.

(b) The condemnation may be in the form of a court order or other instrument authorized by State or local law, e.g., a notification to the property owner of an unsafe condition, or unsanitary condition, or other deficiency at the property address, coupled with a statement that the property owner must vacate the property if the condition giving rise to the condemnation notice is not cured by repair, removal, or demolition of the building by a date certain.

(c) In addition to a condemnation in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a structure must be found by the Federal Insurance Administrator to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels to be eligible for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act.

###### § 63.3 Requirement to be covered by a contract for flood insurance by June 1, 1988.

The requirement in section 1306(c)(4)(C)(i) of the Act that a structure be "covered by a contract for flood insurance under this title-(i) on or before June 1, 1988" was met if presentation of the appropriate premium and a properly completed flood insurance application form was made to the National Flood Insurance Program or a Write Your Own (WYO) Company on or before June 1, 1988.

###### § 63.4 Property not covered.

Benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act do not include compensation for items excluded under the provisions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP).

###### § 63.5 Coverage for contents removal.

Whenever a structure is subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels and otherwise meets the requirements of section 1306(c) of the Act so that benefits are payable under those provisions, the coverage in the definition of "Direct Physical Loss by or from Flood" in the SFIP for the expense of removing contents, up to the minimum deductible of $500.00, to protect and preserve them from flood or from the imminent danger of flood, applies if contents coverage is in effect.

###### § 63.6 Reimbursable relocation costs.

In addition to the coverage described in § 63.5 of this part, relocation costs for which benefits are payable under section 1306(c) of the Act include the costs of:

(a) Removing the structure from the site,

(b) Site cleanup,

(c) Debris removal,

(d) Moving the structure to a new site, and

(e) At the new site, a new foundation and related grading, including elevating the structure as required by local flood plain management ordinances, and sewer, septic, electric, gas, telephone, and water connections at the building.

###### § 63.7 Amount of coverage and deductible on effective date of condemnation or certification.

The amount of building coverage and the deductible applicable to a claim for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act are what was in effect on the date of condemnation or the date of application for certification.

###### § 63.8 Limitation on amount of benefits.

####### under the flood insurance contract issued pursuant to this title

(a) In section 1306(c)(3)(C) of the Act, the phrasemeans the value of the structure under section 1306(c)(3)(C) of the Act is limited to the amount of building coverage provided by the insured's policy.

(b) Where the amount payable under section 1306(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act for the cost of demolition, together with the amount payable under section 1306(c)(1)(A) of the Act for the value of the structure under the demolition option, exceeds the amount of building coverage provided by the insured's policy, such amounts will be paid beyond the amount of that building coverage, even if this payment exceeds the limits of coverage otherwise authorized by section 1306(a) of the Act for the particular class of property.

###### § 63.9 Sale while claim pending.

If a claimant sells a structure prior to its demolition or relocation, no benefits are payable to that claimant under section 1306(c) of the Act, and any payments which may have been made under those provisions shall be reimbursed to the insurer making them.

###### § 63.10 Demolition or relocation contractor to be joint payee.

If a demolition or relocation contractor is used, the instrument of payment for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act for the fee of that contractor, shall include that contractor as a joint payee, unless that contractor has already been paid when the instrument of payment is issued.

###### § 63.11 Requirement for a commitment before October 1, 1989.

The requirement in section 1306(c)(7) of the Act that a commitment be made on or before September 30, 1989 as a necessary condition to making any payments after September 30, 1989, is met if before October 1, 1989,

(a) There is either a condemnation in accordance with § 63.2 of this part or a certification in accordance with subpart B of this part, and

(b) A policyholder's notice of claim for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act is received by the insurer.

###### § 63.12 Setback and community flood plain management requirements.

(a) Where benefits have been paid under section 1306(c) of the Act, the setback requirements in section 1306(c)(5) of the Act, which if not met result in a prohibition against subsequently providing flood insurance or assistance under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, shall apply:

(1) To the structure involved wherever it is located, and

(2) To any other structure subsequently constructed on or moved to the parcel of land on which the structure involved was located when the claim under section 1306(c) of the Act arose.

(b) In addition, any structures relocated under section 1306 of the Act must comply with the flood plain management criteria set forth in § 60.3 of this chapter.

##### Subpart B - State Certification of Structures Subject to Imminent Collapse

###### § 63.13 Purpose of subpart.

The purpose of this subpart is to establish criteria under the provisions of section 1306(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, by which States can obtain approval from the Federal Insurance Administrator to certify that structures are subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. The subpart also sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be utilized by those States in certifying structures as subject to imminent collapse. The State certification procedure represents an option to the use of the procedure whereby a structure is condemned by a State or local authority as a prerequisite to consideration for imminent collapse insurance benefits.

###### § 63.14 Criteria for State qualification to perform imminent collapse certifications.

In order to qualify under this subpart, the State must be administering a coastal zone management program which includes the following components, as a minimum:

(a) A state-wide requirement that prohibits new construction and the relocation of structures seaward of an adopted erosion setback. Such setback must be based in whole or in part on some multiple of the local mean annual erosion (recession) rate; and

(b) An established, complete and functional data base of mean annual erosion rates for all reaches of coastal shorelines subject to erosion in the State, which is used as the basis to enforce these setback requirements.

###### § 63.15 State application for eligibility to certify structures subject to imminent collapse.

(a) Application pursuant to this part shall be made by the Governor or other duly authorized official of the State.

(b) The application must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472.

(c) Documents to be included in the application are as follows:

(1) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations verifying the existence of a coastal zone management program including setback requirements for new and relocated construction which are based in whole or in part on mean annual erosion rates established for the State's shorelines.

(2) A copy of the State's mean annual erosion rate data base, if not already provided, showing such rates for all reaches of coastal shorelines subject to erosion within the State.

(3) The title, address and phone number of a contact person within the State agency having authority for administering the coastal zone management program.

(4) A statement that adequate resources are available to carry out the certification services, and that certifications will be performed in accordance with the procedures described in § 63.17.

###### § 63.16 Review of State application by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator may return the application for eligibility upon finding it incomplete or upon finding that additional information is required in order to make a determination as to the adequacy of the coastal zone management program and erosion rate data base.

(b) Upon determining that the State's program and/or data base does not meet the criteria set forth in § 63.14, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall in writing reject the application for eligibility and indicate in what respects the State program and/or data base fails to comply with the criteria.

(c) Upon determining that the State program and data base meets the criteria set forth in § 63.14, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall approve the State as eligible to certify structures subject to imminent collapse. Such approval, however, is in all cases provisional. The Federal Insurance Administrator shall review the State program and data base for continued compliance with the criteria set forth in this part and may request updated documentation for the purpose of such review. If the program and/or data base is found to be inadequate and is not corrected within ninety days from the date that such inadequacies were identified, the Federal Insurance Administrator may revoke his approval.

###### § 63.17 Procedures and data requirements for imminent collapse certifications by States.

Any State that has been determined to be eligible by the Federal Insurance Administrator may certify that a coastal structure is subject to imminent collapse. Such certification requires that the State collect scientific or technical information relative to the structure and its site and provide such information to the insured to be filed with a claim for insurance benefits under Section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. The information which is provided to the insured shall include, but is not limited to, the following:

(a) Certification from the State agency that the structure is subject to imminent collapse. The certification shall cite the property address, legal description (e.g., lot, block), the date of application for certification, and the date of and basis for the certification, and

(b) Supporting scientific and technical data to substantiate the certification consisting of the following:

(1) Photographs of the structure in relation to the obvious peril. All photographs should be labeled with the location, direction, date and time from which they were taken. The collection of photographs should adequately display the following:

(i) Any evidence of existing damage. The damage can include loss or erosion of soil near or around the foundation, or structural damage to the foundation components.

(ii) Structure and waterbody. These photographs shall show both the structure and the waterbody that presents the peril. If the structure is on a high bluff or dune and not accessible from the water side, the top edge of the bluff or dune will be sufficient. These will usually be taken from one or both sides of the structure.

(iii) Physical reference features used in the measurements discussed below. The reference feature shall be in or near the area affected by normal tides, when applicable. If a reference is not clearly distinguishable on the photograph, it should be annotated to identify the feature. If possible, all reference features described below should be photographed showing their relationship to the site of the threatened structure.

(2) Identification and selection of reference features. The following reference features are presented according to priority. If the first feature is not present, the next feature shall be located and photographed, and so forth.

(i) Top edge of bluff (cliff top).

(ii) Top edge of escarpment on an eroding dune (i.e., a nearly vertical erosional cut at the seaward face of the dune). The normal high tide should be near the toe of the dune and there should be indications that the dune is actively eroding.

(iii) The normal high tide limit may be indicated by one of the following:

(A) Vegetation line (the seaward most edge of permanent vegetation).

(B) Beach scarp (erosion line on beach, usually a sharp, nearly vertical drop of 0.5 to 3.0 feet at the upper limit of high tide).

(C) Debris line deposited by the normal high tide, not by a recent storm.

(D) Upper limit of wet sand.

(3) Distance measurements from the threatened structure to the nearest points on the reference features. These measurements should be taken from all photographed reference features to the closest point on the supporting foundation. For purposes of making this measurement, decks, stairs, and other exterior attachments that do not contribute to the structural support of the building are not considered part of the structure. The measurements shall be taken horizontally with a tape and recorded to the nearest foot. The date and time of the measurement shall be noted. The location of the measurements (i.e., reference feature and closest structural member) shall be identified on the appropriate photograph or sketch of the site. If some or all of the reference features coincide, this shall also be noted and identified on the photographs. Reference features landward of the structure need not be measured, but shall be noted on the photographs.

(4) A determination of the average annual erosion rate at the site and a copy of the pertinent section of the reference document used to obtain the annual erosion rate at the site.

(5) Copy of the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panel annotated with the location of the threatened structure.

(6) In the event that a structure is not situated within a "zone of imminent collapse" using the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, then the State may submit other scientific and technical data, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, that would reveal unusual erosive or stability conditions at the site. Such data must include engineering analyses or reports performed on the structure or site which evaluates local rates of erosion, or the condition or stability of the structure's foundation including supporting soil.

(c) In the case of structures planned to be relocated, a certification as to whether the proposed relocation site is outside the 30-year setback for 1-4 family residential structures, or outside the 60-year setback for all other structures, must also be submitted by the State.

###### § 63.18 Review of State certification by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

The Federal Insurance Administrator, after a claim has been filed by the property owner, will review the certification and data prepared by the State. Upon completion of the review, the State will be notified that:

(a) The structure has been determined to be subject to imminent collapse, or

(b) The structure has not been determined to be subject to imminent collapse and the basis for such determination, or

(c) Additional data are needed to verify that the procedures and criteria for imminent collapse certification have been met.

#### PART 64 - COMMUNITIES ELIGIBLE FOR THE SALE OF INSURANCE

##### § 64.1 Purpose of part.

(a) 42 U.S.C. 4012(c), 4022 and 4102 require that flood insurance in the maximum limits of coverage under the regular program shall be offered in communities only after the Federal Insurance Administrator has: (1) Identified the areas of special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion hazards within the community; and/or (2) completed a risk study for the applicant community. The priorities for conducting such risk studies are set forth in §§ 59.23 and 60.25 of this subchapter. The purpose of this part is to define the types of zones which the Agency will use for identifying the hazard areas on maps.

(b) 42 U.S.C. 4056 authorizes an emergency implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program whereby the Federal Insurance Administrator may make subsidized coverage available to eligible communities prior to the completion of detailed risk studies for such areas. This part also describes procedures under the emergency program and lists communities which become eligible under the NFIP.

##### § 64.2 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in part 59 of this subchapter are applicable to this part.

##### § 64.3 Flood Insurance Maps.

(a) The following maps may be prepared by the Federal Insurance Administrator for use in connection with the sale of flood insurance:

(1) Flood Insurance Rate Map: This map is prepared after the flood hazard study for the community has been completed and the risk premium rates have been established. The FIRM indicates the risk premium rate zones applicable in the community and when those rates are effective. The FIRM also may indicate, at the request of the community, zones to identify areas of future-conditions flood hazards. The symbols used to designate the risk premium rate zones and future-conditions zones are as follows:

(2) Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). This map is issued by the Administrator delineating Zones A, M, and E within a community.

(b) Notice of the issuance of new or revised FHBMs or FIRMs is given in Part 65 of this subchapter. The mandatory purchase of insurance is required within designated Zones A, A1-30, AE, A99, AO, AH, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, V1-30, VE, V, VO, M, and E.

(c) The FHBM or FIRM shall be maintained for public inspection at the following locations:

(1) The information office of the State agency or agencies designated by statute or the respective Governors to cooperate with the Federal Insurance Administrator in implementing the Program whenever a community becomes eligible for Program participation and the sale of insurance pursuant to this section or is identified as flood prone.

(2) One or more official locations within the community in which flood insurance is offered.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) The official record copy of each official map shall be maintained in FEMA files in Washington, DC.

##### § 64.4 Effect on community eligibility resulting from boundary changes, governmental reorganization, etc.

(a) When a community not participating in the Program acquires by means of annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, an area within another community participating in the Program, no new flood insurance shall be made available as of the effective date of annexation until the newly acquiring community participates in the Program. Until the effective date of participation, existing flood insurance policies remain in effect until the policy's date of expiration, but shall not be renewed.

(b) When a community participating in the Program acquires by means of annexation, incorporation, or otherwise, another area which was previously located in a community either participating or not participating in the Program, the community shall have six months from the date of acquisition to formally amend its flood plain management regulations in order to include all flood-prone areas within the newly acquired area. The amended regulations shall satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter based on the data previously provided by the Administrator. In the event that the newly acquired area was previously located in a community participating in the Program, the provisions of this section shall only apply if the community, upon acquisition, and pending formal adoption of the amendment to its flood plain management regulations, certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that within the newly acquired area the flood plain management requirements previously applicable in the area remain in force. In the event that the newly-acquired area was previously located in a community not participating in the Program, the provisions of the section shall only apply if the community, upon acquisition, and pending formal adoption of the amendments to its flood plain management regulations, certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that it shall enforce within the newly-acquired area the requirements of § 60.3(b) of this subchapter. During the six month period, existing flood insurance policies shall remain in effect until their date of expiration may be renewed, and new policies may be issued. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 shall result in the community's suspension from Program participation pursuant to § 59.24 of this subchapter.

(c) When an area previously a part of a community participating in the Program becomes autonomous or becomes a portion of a newly autonomous community resulting from boundary changes, governmental reorganization, changes in state statutes or constitution, or otherwise, such new community shall be given six months from the date of its independence, to adopt flood plain management regulations within the special hazard areas subject to its jurisdiction and to submit its application for participation as a separate community in order to retain eligibility for the sale of flood insurance. The regulations adopted by such new community shall satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter based on the data previously provided by the Federal Insurance Administrator. The provisions of this section shall only apply where the new community upon the date of its independence certifies in writing over the signature of a community official that, pending formal adoption of flood plain management regulations, the flood plain management requirements previously applicable in that area remain in effect. During the six month period, existing flood insurance policies shall remain in effect until their dates of expiration may be renewed, and new policies may be issued. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements in § 60.3 of this subchapter shall result in the community's suspension from Program participation pursuant to § 59.24 of this subchapter.

(d) Where any community or any area within a community had in effect a FHBM or FIRM, but all or a portion of that community has been acquired by another community, or becomes autonomous, that map shall remain in effect until it is superseded by the Federal Insurance Administrator, whether by republication as part of the map of the acquiring community, or otherwise.

(e) When a community described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section has flood elevations in effect, no new appeal period under parts 66, 67, and 68 of this subchapter will begin except as new scientific and technical data are available.

##### § 64.5 Relationship of rates to zone designations.

(a) In order to expedite a community's qualification for flood insurance under the emergency program, the Administrator may authorize the sale of such insurance without designating any Zones A, M, or E within a community, provided the community has previously adopted flood plain management regulations meeting the requirements of § 60.3(a), § 60.4(a) or § 60.5(a) of this subchapter. When the Administrator has obtained sufficient technical information to delineate Zones A, M, or E, he/she shall delineate the tentative boundaries on a FHBM.

(b) Upon the effective date of the FIRM, flood insurance will continue to be available throughout the entire community at chargeable rates (i.e., subsidized) for first layer coverage of existing structures, but will be only available at risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements. Upon the effective date of a FIRM, second layer coverage is available only at risk premium rates for all structures.

(c) Detailed insurance information may be obtained from the servicing companies. See part 62 of this subchapter.

##### § 64.6 List of eligible communities.

FEMA will maintain a list of communities eligible for the sale of flood insurance pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (42 U.S.C. 4001-4128). This list will be published and maintained on the internet or through another comparable method.

#### PART 65 - IDENTIFICATION AND MAPPING OF SPECIAL HAZARD AREAS

##### § 65.1 Purpose of part.

42 U.S.C. 4104 authorizes the Administrator to identify and publish information with respect to all areas within the United States having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards. The purpose of this part is to outline the steps a community needs to take in order to assist the Agency's effort in providing up-to-date identification and publication, in the form of the maps described in part 64, on special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards.

##### § 65.2 Definitions.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the definitions set forth in part 59 of this subchapter are applicable to this part.

(b) For the purpose of this part, a certification by a registered professional engineer or other party does not constitute a warranty or guarantee of performance, expressed or implied. Certification of data is a statement that the data is accurate to the best of the certifier's knowledge. Certification of analyses is a statement that the analyses have been performed correctly and in accordance with sound engineering practices. Certification of structural works is a statement that the works are designed in accordance with sound engineering practices to provide protection from the base flood. Certification of "as built" conditions is a statement that the structure(s) has been built according to the plans being certified, is in place, and is fully functioning.

(c) For the purposes of this part, "reasonably safe from flooding" means base flood waters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the SFHA and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings.

##### § 65.3 Requirement to submit new technical data.

A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with this part. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data.

##### § 65.4 Right to submit new technical data.

(a) A community has a right to request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does not impact flood plain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such as community boundary changes, labeling, or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation in accordance with this part and may be submitted at any time.

(b) All requests for changes to effective maps, other than those initiatedby FEMA, must be made in writing by the Chief Executive Officer of the community (CEO) or an official designated by the CEO. Should the CEO refuse to submit such a request on behalf of another party, FEMA will agree to review it only if written evidence is provided indicating the CEO or designee has been requested to do so.

(c) Requests for changes to effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) are subject to the cost recovery procedures described in 44 CFR part 72. As indicated in part 72, revisions requested to correct mapping errors or errors in the Flood Insurance Study analysis are not to be subject to the cost-recovery procedures.

##### § 65.5 Revision to special hazard area boundaries with no change to base flood elevation determinations.

###### Data requirements for topographic changes.

(a)In many areas of special flood hazard (excluding V zones and floodways) it may be feasible to elevate areas with engineered earthen fill above the base flood elevation. Scientific and technical information to support a request to gain exclusion from an area of special flood hazard of a structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by the placement of engineered earthen fill will include the following:

###### e.g.,

(1) A copy of the recorded deed indicating the legal description of the property and the official recordation information (deed book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official (County Clerk or Recorder of Deeds).

(2) If the property is recorded on a plat map, a copy of the recorded plat indicating both the location of the property and the official recordation information (plat book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official. If the property is not recorded on a plat map, FEMA requires copies of the tax map or other suitable maps to help in locating the property accurately.

(3) A topographic map or other information indicating existing ground elevations and the date of fill. FEMA's determination to exclude a legally defined parcel of land or a structure from the area of special flood hazard will be based upon a comparison of the base flood elevations to the lowest ground elevation of the parcel or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. If the lowest ground elevation of the entire legally defined parcel of land or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure are at or above the elevations of the base flood, FEMA will exclude the parcel and/or structure from the area of special flood hazard.

(4) Written assurance by the participating community that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3. This includes the requirements that:

(i) Existing residential structures built in the SFHA have their lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood;

(ii) The participating community has determined that the land and any existing or proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are "reasonably safe from flooding", and that they have on file, available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used to make that determination;

(iii) The participating community has issued permits for all existing and proposed construction or other development; and

(iv) All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies where approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.

(5) If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3, of this chapter, the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are "reasonably safe from flooding," we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth in § 65.5(a). The community must maintain on file, and make available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used in determining that the land or structures are "reasonably safe from flooding."

(6) Data to substantiate the base flood elevation. If we complete a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), we will use those data to substantiate the base flood elevation. Otherwise, the community may submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service, State and local water resource departments, or technical data prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer. If base flood elevations have not previously been established, we may also request hydrologic and hydraulic calculations.

(7) A revision of floodplain delineations based on fill must demonstrate that any such fill does not result in a floodway encroachment.

###### New topographic data.

(b)A community may also follow the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section to request a map revision when no physical changes have occurred in the area of special flood hazard, when no fill has been placed, and when the natural ground elevations are at or above the elevations of the base flood, where new topographic maps are more detailed or more accurate than the current map.

###### Certification requirements.

(c)A registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor must certify the items required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) and (b) of this section. Such certifications are subject to the provisions under § 65.2.

###### Submission procedures.

(d)Submit all requests to the appropriate address serving the community's geographic area or to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC.

##### § 65.6 Revision of base flood elevation determinations.

###### General conditions and data requirements.

(a)(1) The supporting data must include all the information FEMA needs to review and evaluate the request. This may involve the requestor's performing new hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and delineation of new flood plain boundaries and floodways, as necessary.

(2) To avoid discontinuities between the revised and unrevised flood data, the necessary hydrologic and hydraulic analyses submitted by the map revision requestor must be extensive enough to ensure that a logical transition can be shown between the revised flood elevations, flood plain boundaries, and floodways and those developed previously for areas not affected by the revision. Unless it is demonstrated that it would not be appropriate, the revised and unrevised base flood elevations must match within one-half foot where such transitions occur.

(3) Revisions cannot be made based on the effects of proposed projects or future conditions. Section 65.8 of this subchapter contains provisions for obtaining conditional approval of proposed projects that may effect map changes when they are completed.

(4) The datum and date of releveling of benchmarks, if any, to which the elevations are referenced must be indicated.

(5) Maps will not be revised when discharges change as a result of the use of an alternative methodology or data for computing flood discharges unless the change is statistically significant as measured by a confidence limits analysis of the new discharge estimates.

(6) Any computer program used to perform hydrologic or hydraulic analyses in support of a flood insurance map revision must meet all of the following criteria:

(i) It must have been reviewed and accepted by a governmental agency responsible for the implementation of programs for flood control and/or the regulation of flood plain lands. For computer programs adopted by non-Federal agencies, certification by a responsible agency official must be provided which states that the program has been reviewed, tested, and accepted by that agency for purposes of design of flood control structures or flood plain land use regulation.

(ii) It must be well-documented including source codes and user's manuals.

(iii) It must be available to FEMA and all present and future parties impacted by flood insurance mapping developed or amended through the use of the program. For programs not generally available from a Federal agency, the source code and user's manuals must be sent to FEMA free of charge, with fully-documented permission from the owner that FEMA may release the code and user's manuals to such impacted parties.

(7) A revised hydrologic analysis for flooding sources with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood discharges.

(8) A revised hydraulic analysis for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood elevations, and of the floodway. Unless the basis of the request is the use of an alternative hydraulic methodology or the requestor can demonstrate that the data of the original hydraulic computer model is unavailable or its use is inappropriate, the analysis shall be made using the same hydraulic computer model used to develop the base flood elevations shown on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and updated to show present conditions in the flood plain. Copies of the input and output data from the original and revised hydraulic analyses shall be submitted.

(9) A hydrologic or hydraulic analysis for a flooding source without established base flood elevations may be performed for only the 100-year flood.

(10) A revision of flood plain delineations based on topographic changes must demonstrate that any topographic changes have not resulted in a floodway encroachment.

(11) Delineations of flood plain boundaries for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must provide both the 100- and 500-year flood plain boundaries. For flooding sources without established base flood elevations, only 100-year flood plain boundaries need be submitted. These boundaries should be shown on a topographic map of suitable scale and contour interval.

(12) If a community or other party seeks recognition from FEMA, on its FHBM or FIRM, that an altered or relocated portion of a watercourse provides protection from, or mitigates potential hazards of, the base flood, the Federal Insurance Administrator may request specific documentation from the community certifying that, and describing how, the provisions of § 60.3(b)(7) of this subchapter will be met for the particular watercourse involved. This documentation, which may be in the form of a written statement from the Community Chief Executive Officer, an ordinance, or other legislative action, shall describe the nature of the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency with which they will be performed, and the title of the local community official who will be responsible for assuring that the maintenance activities are accomplished.

(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 65.6, a community may submit, in lieu of the documentation specified in § 65.6(a)(12), certification by a registered professional engineer that the project has been designed to retain its flood carrying capacity without periodic maintenance.

(14) The participating community must provide written assurance that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3 of this chapter. This includes the requirements that:

(i) Existing residential structures built in the SFHA have their lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood;

(ii) The participating community has determined that the land and any existing or proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are "reasonably safe from flooding," and that they have on file, available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used to make that determination;

(iii) The participating community has issued permits for all existing and proposed construction or other development; and

(iv) All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies where approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.

(15) If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3, of this chapter the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are "reasonably safe from flooding," we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth under § 65.6. The community must maintain on file, and make available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used in determining that the land or structures are "reasonably safe from flooding."

###### Data requirements for correcting map errors.

(b)To correct errors in the original flood analysis, technical data submissions shall include the following:

(1) Data identifying mathematical errors.

(2) Data identifying measurement errors and providing correct measurements.

###### Data requirements for changed physical conditions.

###### Submission procedures.

(g)All requests shall be submitted to the FEMA Regional Office servicing the community's geographic area or to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC, and shall be accompanied by the appropriate payment, in accordance with 44 CFR part 72.

##### § 65.7 Floodway revisions.

###### General.

(a)Floodway data is developed as part of FEMA Flood Insurance Studies and is utilized by communities to select and adopt floodways as part of the flood plain management program required by § 60.3 of this subchapter. When it has been determined by a community that no practicable alternatives exist to revising the boundaries of its previously adopted floodway, the procedures below shall be followed.

###### Data requirements when base flood elevation changes are requested.

(b)When a floodway revision is requested in association with a change to base flood elevations, the data requirements of § 65.6 shall also be applicable. In addition, the following documentation shall be submitted:

(1) Copy of a public notice distributed by the community stating the community's intent to revise the floodway or a statement by the community that it has notified all affected property owners and affected adjacent jurisdictions.

(2) Copy of a letter notifying the appropriate State agency of the floodway revision when the State has jurisdiction over the floodway or its adoption by communities participating in the NFIP.

(3) Documentation of the approval of the revised floodway by the appropriate State agency (for communities where the State has jurisdiction over the floodway or its adoption by communities participating in the NFIP).

(4) Engineering analysis for the revised floodway, as described below:

(i) The floodway analysis must be performed using the hydraulic computer model used to determine the proposed base flood elevations.

(ii) The floodway limits must be set so that neither the effective base flood elevations nor the proposed base flood elevations if less than the effective base flood elevations, are increased by more than the amount specified under § 60.3 (d)(2). Copies of the input and output data from the original and modified computer models must be submitted.

(5) Delineation of the revised floodway on the same topographic map used for the delineation of the revised flood boundaries.

###### Data requirements for changes not associated with base flood elevation changes.

(c)The following data shall be submitted:

(1) Items described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section must be submitted.

(2) Engineering analysis for the revised floodway, as described below:

(i) The original hydraulic computer model used to develop the established base flood elevations must be modified to include all encroachments that have occurred in the flood plain since the existing floodway was developed. If the original hydraulic computer model is not available, an alternate hydraulic computer model may be used provided the alternate model has been calibrated so as to reproduce the original water surface profile of the original hydraulic computer model. The alternate model must be then modified to include all encroachments that have occurred since the existing floodway was developed.

(ii) The floodway analysis must be performed with the modified computer model using the desired floodway limits.

(iii) The floodway limits must be set so that combined effects of the past encroachments and the new floodway limits do not increase the effective base flood elevations by more than the amount specified in § 60.3(d)(2). Copies of the input and output data from the original and modified computer models must be submitted.

(3) Delineation of the revised floodway on a copy of the effective NFIP map and a suitable topographic map.

###### Certification requirements.

(e)All requests that involve changes to floodways shall be submitted to the appropriate FEMA Regional Office servicing the community's geographic area.

##### § 65.8 Review of proposed projects.

A community, or an individual through the community, may request FEMA's comments on whether a proposed project, if built as proposed, would justify a map revision. FEMA's comments will be issued in the form of a letter, termed a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, in accordance with 44 CFR part 72. The data required to support such requests are the same as those required for final revisions under §§ 65.5, 65.6, and 65.7, except as-built certification is not required. All such requests shall be submitted to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC, and shall be accompanied by the appropriate payment, in accordance with 44 CFR part 72.

##### § 65.9 Review and response by the Administrator.

If any questions or problems arise during review, FEMA will consult the Chief Executive Officer of the community (CEO), the community official designated by the CEO, and/or the requester for resolution. Upon receipt of a revision request, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall mail an acknowledgment of receipt of such request to the CEO. Within 90 days of receiving the request with all necessary information, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the CEO of one or more of the following:

(a) The effective map(s) shall not be modified;

(b) The base flood elevations on the effective FIRM shall be modified and new base flood elevations shall be established under the provisions of part 67 of this subchapter;

(c) The changes requested are approved and the map(s) amended by Letter of Map Revision (LOMR);

(d) The changes requested are approved and a revised map(s) will be printed and distributed;

(e) The changes requested are not of such a significant nature as to warrant a reissuance or revision of the flood insurance study or maps and will be deferred until such time as a significant change occurs;

(f) An additional 90 days is required to evaluate the scientific or technical data submitted; or

(g) Additional data are required to support the revision request.

(h) The required payment has not been submitted in accordance with 44 CFR part 72, no review will be conducted and no determination will be issued until payment is received.

##### § 65.10 Mapping of areas protected by levee systems.

###### General.

(a)For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will only recognize in its flood hazard and risk mapping effort those levee systems that meet, and continue to meet, minimum design, operation, and maintenance standards that are consistent with the level of protection sought through the comprehensive flood plain management criteria established by § 60.3 of this subchapter. Accordingly, this section describes the types of information FEMA needs to recognize, on NFIP maps, that a levee system provides protection from the base flood. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a levee system at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought based on a levee system, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized structures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how a structure or system will perform in a flood event.

###### Design criteria.

(b)For levees to be recognized by FEMA, evidence that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are in place to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood exists must be provided. The following requirements must be met:

###### Freeboard.

(1)(i) Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An additional one foot above the minimum is required within 100 feet in either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the minimum at the downstream end of the levee, is also required.

(ii) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum riverine freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood elevation profile and include, but not necessarily be limited to an assessment of statistical confidence limits of the 100-year discharge; changes in stage-discharge relationships; and the sources, potential, and magnitude of debris, sediment, and ice accumulation. It must be also shown that the levee will remain structurally stable during the base flood when such additional loading considerations are imposed. Under no circumstances will freeboard of less than two feet be accepted.

(iii) For coastal levees, the freeboard must be established at one foot above the height of the one percent wave or the maximum wave runup (whichever is greater) associated with the 100-year stillwater surge elevation at the site.

(iv) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum coastal levee freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood loading conditions. Particular emphasis must be placed on the effects of wave attack and overtopping on the stability of the levee. Under no circumstances, however, will a freeboard of less than two feet above the 100-year stillwater surge elevation be accepted.

###### Closures.

(2)All openings must be provided with closure devices that are structural parts of the system during operation and design according to sound engineering practice.

###### Embankment protection.

(3)Engineering analyses must be submitted that demonstrate that no appreciable erosion of the levee embankment can be expected during the base flood, as a result of either currents or waves, and that anticipated erosion will not result in failure of the levee embankment or foundation directly or indirectly through reduction of the seepage path and subsequent instability. The factors to be addressed in such analyses include, but are not limited to: Expected flow velocities (especially in constricted areas); expected wind and wave action; ice loading; impact of debris; slope protection techniques; duration of flooding at various stages and velocities; embankment and foundation materials; levee alignment, bends, and transitions; and levee side slopes.

###### Embankment and foundation stability.

(4)Engineering analyses that evaluate levee embankment stability must be submitted. The analyses provided shall evaluate expected seepage during loading conditions associated with the base flood and shall demonstrate that seepage into or through the levee foundation and embankment will not jeopardize embankment or foundation stability. An alternative analysis demonstrating that the levee is designed and constructed for stability against loading conditions for Case IV as defined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) manual, "Design and Construction of Levees" (EM 1110-2-1913, Chapter 6, Section II), may be used. The factors that shall be addressed in the analyses include: Depth of flooding, duration of flooding, embankment geometry and length of seepage path at critical locations, embankment and foundation materials, embankment compaction, penetrations, other design factors affecting seepage (such as drainage layers), and other design factors affecting embankment and foundation stability (such as berms).

###### Settlement.

(5)Engineering analyses must be submitted that assess the potential and magnitude of future losses of freeboard as a result of levee settlement and demonstrate that freeboard will be maintained within the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This analysis must address embankment loads, compressibility of embankment soils, compressibility of foundation soils, age of the levee system, and construction compaction methods. In addition, detailed settlement analysis using procedures such as those described in the COE manual, "Soil Mechanics Design-Settlement Analysis" (EM 1100-2-1904) must be submitted.

###### Interior drainage.

(6)An analysis must be submitted that identifies the source(s) of such flooding, the extent of the flooded area, and, if the average depth is greater than one foot, the water-surface elevation(s) of the base flood. This analysis must be based on the joint probability of interior and exterior flooding and the capacity of facilities (such as drainage lines and pumps) for evacuating interior floodwaters.

###### Other design criteria.

(7)In unique situations, such as those where the levee system has relatively high vulnerability, FEMA may require that other design criteria and analyses be submitted to show that the levees provide adequate protection. In such situations, sound engineering practice will be the standard on which FEMA will base its determinations. FEMA will also provide the rationale for requiring this additional information.

###### Operation plans and criteria.

(c)For a levee system to be recognized, the operational criteria must be as described below. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual, a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or when the manual for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP.

###### Closures.

(1)Operation plans for closures must include the following:

(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists for the completed operation of all closure structures, including necessary sealing, before floodwaters reach the base of the closure.

(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.

(iii) Provisions for periodic operation, at not less than one-year intervals, of the closure structure for testing and training purposes.

###### Interior drainage systems.

(2)Interior drainage systems associated with levee systems usually include storage areas, gravity outlets, pumping stations, or a combination thereof. These drainage systems will be recognized by FEMA on NFIP maps for flood protection purposes only if the following minimum criteria are included in the operation plan:

(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists to permit activation of mechanized portions of the drainage system.

(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.

(iii) Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic systems.

(iv) Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the inspections or the operations.

###### Other operation plans and criteria.

(3)Other operating plans and criteria may be required by FEMA to ensure that adequate protection is provided in specific situations. In such cases, sound emergency management practice will be the standard upon which FEMA determinations will be based.

###### Maintenance plans and criteria.

(d)For levee systems to be recognized as providing protection from the base flood, the maintenance criteria must be as described herein. Levee systems must be maintained in accordance with an officially adopted maintenance plan, and a copy of this plan must be provided to FEMA by the owner of the levee system when recognition is being sought or when the plan for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All maintenance activities must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP that must assume ultimate responsibility for maintenance. This plan must document the formal procedure that ensures that the stability, height, and overall integrity of the levee and its associated structures and systems are maintained. At a minimum, maintenance plans shall specify the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency of their performance, and the person by name or title responsible for their performance.

###### Certification requirements.

(e)Data submitted to support that a given levee system complies with the structural requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the levee must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at § 65.2 of this subchapter. In lieu of these structural requirements, a Federal agency with responsibility for levee design may certify that the levee has been adequately designed and constructed to provide protection against the base flood.

##### § 65.11 Evaluation of sand dunes in mapping coastal flood hazard areas.

###### General conditions.

(a)For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will consider storm-induced dune erosion potential in its determination of coastal flood hazards and risk mapping efforts. The criterion to be used in the evaluation of dune erosion will apply to primary frontal dunes as defined in § 59.1, but does not apply to artificially designed and constructed dunes that are not well-established with long-standing vegetative cover, such as the placement of sand materials in a dune-like formation.

###### Evaluation criterion.

(b)Primary frontal dunes will not be considered as effective barriers to base flood storm surges and associated wave action where the cross-sectional area of the primary frontal dune, as measured perpendicular to the shoreline and above the 100-year stillwater flood elevation and seaward of the dune crest, is equal to, or less than, 540 square feet.

###### Exceptions.

(c)Exceptions to the evaluation criterion may be granted where it can be demonstrated through authoritative historical documentation that the primary frontal dunes at a specific site withstood previous base flood storm surges and associated wave action.

##### § 65.12 Revision of flood insurance rate maps to reflect base flood elevations caused by proposed encroachments.

(a) When a community proposes to permit encroachments upon the flood plain when a regulatory floodway has not been adopted or to permit encroachments upon an adopted regulatory floodway which will cause base flood elevation increases in excess of those permitted under paragraphs (c)(10) or (d)(3) of § 60.3 of this subchapter, the community shall apply to the Federal Insurance Administrator for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments to occur and shall submit the following as part of its application:

(1) A request for conditional approval of map change and the appropriate initial fee as specified by § 72.3 of this subchapter or a request for exemption from fees as specified by § 72.5 of this subchapter, whichever is appropriate;

(2) An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in a base flood elevation increase above that permitted under paragraphs (c)(10) or (d)(3) of § 60.3 of this subchapter demonstrating why these alternatives are not feasible;

(3) Documentation of individual legal notice to all impacted property owners within and outside of the community, explaining the impact of the proposed action on their property.

(4) Concurrence of the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions;

(5) Certification that no structures are located in areas which would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;

(6) A request for revision of base flood elevation determination according to the provisions of § 65.6 of this part;

(7) A request for floodway revision in accordance with the provisions of § 65.7 of this part;

(b) Upon receipt of the Federal Insurance Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to the Federal Insurance Administrator of the adoption of flood plain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.

(c) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide as-built certifications in accordance with the provisions of § 65.3 of this part. The Federal Insurance Administrator will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with part 67 of this subchapter.

##### § 65.13 Mapping and map revisions for areas subject to alluvial fan flooding.

This section describes the procedures to be followed and the types of information FEMA needs to recognize on a NFIP map that a structural flood control measure provides protection from the base flood in an area subject to alluvial fan flooding. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a flood control measure at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized flood control measures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how the flood control measure will perform in a flood event.

(a) The applicable provisions of §§ 65.2, 65.3, 65.4, 65.6, 65.8 and 65.10 shall also apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding.

(b) The provisions of § 65.5 regarding map revisions based on fill and the provisions of part 70 of this chapter shall not apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding. In general, elevations of a parcel of land or a structure by fill or other means, will not serve as a basis for removing areas subject to alluvial fan flooding from an area of special food hazards.

(c) FEMA will credit on NFIP maps only major structural flood control measures whose design and construction are supported by sound engineering analyses which demonstrate that the measures will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the area protected by such measures. The provided analyses must include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

(1) Engineering analyses that quantify the discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment movement associated with the flood that has a one-percent probability of being exceeded in any year at the apex under current watershed conditions and under potential adverse conditions (e.g., deforestation of the watershed by fire). The potential for debris flow and sediment movement must be assessed using an engineering method acceptable to FEMA. The assessment should consider the characteristics and availability of sediment in the drainage basin above the apex and on the alluvial fan.

(2) Engineering analyses showing that the measures will accommodate the estimated peak discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and will withstand the associated hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces.

(3) Engineering analyses showing that the measures have been designed to withstand the potential erosion and scour associated with estimated discharges.

(4) Engineering analyses or evidence showing that the measures will provide protection from hazards associated with the possible relocation of flow paths from other parts of the fan.

(5) Engineering analyses that assess the effect of the project on flood hazards, including depth and velocity of floodwaters and scour and sediment deposition, on other areas of the fan.

(6) Engineering analyses demonstrating that flooding from sources other than the fan apex, including local runoff, is either insignificant or has been accounted for in the design.

###### Coordination.

(d)FEMA will recognize measures that are adequately designed and constructed, provided that: evidence is submitted to show that the impact of the measures on flood hazards in all areas of the fan (including those not protected by the flood control measures), and the design and maintenance requirements of the measures, were reviewed and approved by the impacted communities, and also by State and local agencies that have jurisdiction over flood control activities.

###### Operation and maintenance plans and criteria.

(e)The requirements for operation and maintenance of flood control measures on areas subject to alluvial fan flooding shall be those specified under § 65.10, paragraphs (c) and (d), when applicable.

###### Certification requirements.

(f)Data submitted to support that a given flood control measure complies with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the flood control measures must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at § 65.2.

##### § 65.14 Remapping of areas for which local flood protection systems no longer provide base flood protection.

###### General.

(a)(1) This section describes the procedures to follow and the types of information FEMA requires to designate flood control restoration zones. A community may be eligible to apply for this zone designation if the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that it is engaged in the process of restoring a flood protection system that was:

(i) Constructed using Federal funds;

(ii) Recognized as providing base flood protection on the community's effective FIRM; and

(iii) Decertified by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction.

(2) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community is in the process of restoring its flood protection system to provide base flood protection, a FIRM will be prepared that designates the temporary flood hazard areas as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR). Existing special flood hazard areas shown on the community's effective FIRM that are further inundated by Zone AR flooding shall be designated as a "dual" flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR/AE or AR/AH with Zone AR base flood elevations, and AE or AH with base flood elevations and Zone AR/AO with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone AO with flood depths, or Zone AR/A with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone A without base flood elevations.

###### Limitations.

(b)A community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once while restoring a flood protection system. This limitation does not preclude future flood control restoration zone designations should a fully restored, certified, and accredited system become decertified for a second or subsequent time.

(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing or constructing, or both, the restoration project must complete restoration or meet the requirements of 44 CFR 61.12 within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 10 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone.

(2) A community that does not receive Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must complete restoration within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 5 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone. Such a community is not eligible for the provisions of § 61.12. The designated restoration period may not be extended beyond the maximum allowable under this limitation.

###### Exclusions.

(c)The provisions of these regulations do not apply in a coastal high hazard area as defined in 44 CFR 59.1, including areas that would be subject to coastal high hazards as a result of the decertification of a flood protection system shown on the community's effective FIRM as providing base flood protection.

###### Effective date for risk premium rates.

(d)The effective date for any risk premium rates established for Zone AR shall be the effective date of the revised FIRM showing Zone AR designations.

###### Application and submittal requirements for designation of a flood control restoration zone.

(e)A community must submit a written request to the Federal Insurance Administrator, signed by the community's Chief Executive Officer, for a flood plain designation as a flood control restoration zone. The request must include a legislative action by the community requesting the designation. The Federal Insurance Administrator will not initiate any action to designate flood control restoration zones without receipt of the formal request from the community that complies with all requirements of this section. The Federal Insurance Administrator reserves the right to request additional information from the community to support or further document the community's formal request for designation of a flood control restoration zone, if deemed necessary.

(1) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project must include:

(i) A statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the community's Chief Executive Officer, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and if so, the purpose of that litigation;

(ii) A statement whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, and if so, a statement that details the disposition of such previous request;

(iii) A statement from the community and certification by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction that the existing flood control system shown on the effective FIRM was originally built using Federal funds, that it no longer provides base flood protection, but that it continues to provide protection from the flood having at least a 3-percent chance of occurrence during any given year;

(iv) An official map of the community or legal description, with supporting documentation, that the community will adopt as part of its flood plain management measures, which designates developed areas as defined in § 59.1 and as further defined in § 60.3(f).

(v) A restoration plan to return the system to a level of base flood protection. At a minimum, this plan must:

(A) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction schedules of planned features;

(B) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates;

(C) Identify the date on which "as built" drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system, or;

(D) Identify the date on which the community will submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. This date may not exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system;

(vi) A statement identifying the local project sponsor responsible for restoration of the flood protection system;

(vii) A copy of a study, performed by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction in consultation with the local project sponsor, which demonstrates a Federal interest in restoration of the system and which deems that the flood protection system is restorable to a level of base flood protection.

(viii) A joint statement from the Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction involved in restoration of the flood protection system and the local project sponsor certifying that the design and construction of the flood control system involves Federal funds, and that the restoration of the flood protection system will provide base flood protection;

(2) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must:

(i) Meet the requirements of § 65.14(e)(1)(i) through (iv);

(ii) Include a restoration plan to return the system to a level of base flood protection. At a minimum, this plan must:

(A) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction schedules of planned features;

(B) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates; and

(C) Identify the date on which "as built" drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system;

(vi) Include a statement from the local agency responsible for restoration of the flood protection system that identifies the source of funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project and a percentage of the total funds contributed by each source. The statement must demonstrate, at a minimum, that 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated.

###### Review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(f)The review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator shall be in accordance with procedures specified in § 65.9.

###### Requirements for maintaining designation of a flood control restoration zone.

(g)During the restoration period, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, must certify annually to the FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the restoration plan within the time period specified by the plan. In addition, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, will update the restoration plan and will identify any permitting or construction problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration plan previously submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction will make an annual assessment and recommendation to the Federal Insurance Administrator as to the viability of the restoration plan and will conduct periodic on-site inspections of the flood protection system under restoration.

###### Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to adequate progress or complete restoration of the flood protection system.

(h)At any time during the restoration period:

(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project shall provide written evidence of certification from a Federal agency having flood protection design or construction responsibility that the necessary improvements have been completed and that the system has been restored to provide protection from the base flood, or submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. If the Administrator determines that adequate progress has been made, FEMA will revise the zone designation from a flood control restoration zone designation to Zone A99.

(2) After the improvements have been completed, certified by a Federal agency as providing base flood protection, and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood control system.

(3) A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must provide written evidence that the restored flood protection system meets the requirements of part 65. A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project is not eligible for a finding of adequate progress under § 61.12.

(4) After the improvements have been completed and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood protection system.

###### Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to non-compliance with the restoration schedule or as a result of a finding that satisfactory progress is not being made to complete the restoration.

(i)At any time during the restoration period, should the Federal Insurance Administrator determine that the restoration will not be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is not being made to restore the flood protection system to provide complete flood protection in accordance with the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community and the responsible Federal agency, in writing, of the determination, the reasons for that determination, and that the FIRM will be revised to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, the community may submit written information that provides assurance that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is being made to restore complete protection in accordance with the restoration plan, or that, with reasonable certainty, the restoration will be completed within the maximum allowable restoration period. On the basis of this information the Federal Insurance Administrator may suspend the decision to revise the FIRM to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. If the community does not submit any information, or if, based on a review of the information submitted, there is sufficient cause to find that the restoration will not be completed as provided for in the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall revise the FIRM, in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67, and shall remove the flood control restoration zone designations and shall redesignate those areas as Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A.

##### § 65.15 List of communities submitting new technical data.

This section provides a cumulative list of communities where modifications of the base flood elevation determinations have been made because of submission of new scientific or technical data. Due to the need for expediting the modifications, the revised map is already in effect and the appeal period commences on or about the effective date of the modified map. An interim rule, followed by a final rule, will list the revised map effective date, local repository and the name and address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community. The map(s) is (are) effective for both flood plain management and insurance purposes.

##### § 65.16 Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form and Instructions.

(a) Section 528 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 1365(a)) directs FEMA to develop a standard form for determining, in the case of a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home, whether the building or mobile home is located in an area identified by the Director as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance under this title is available. The purpose of the form is to determine whether a building or mobile home is located within an identified Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), whether flood insurance is required, and whether federal flood insurance is available. Use of this form will ensure that required flood insurance coverage is purchased for structures located in an SFHA, and will assist federal entities for lending regulation in assuring compliance with these purchase requirements.

###### http://www.fema.gov/nfip/mpurfi.htm.

(b) The form is available by written request to Federal Emergency Management Agency, PO Box 2012, Jessup, MD 20794; ask for the Standard Flood Hazard Determination form. It is also available by fax-on-demand; call (202) 646-3362, form #23103. Finally, the form is available through the Internet at

##### § 65.17 Review of determinations.

This section describes the procedures that shall be followed and the types of information required by FEMA to review a determination of whether a building or manufactured home is located within an identified Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

###### General conditions.

(a)The borrower and lender of a loan secured by improved real estate or a manufactured home may jointly request that FEMA review a determination that the building or manufactured home is located in an identified SFHA. Such a request must be submitted within 45 days of the lender's notification to the borrower that the building or manufactured home is in the SFHA and that flood insurance is required. Such a request must be submitted jointly by the lender and the borrower and shall include the required fee and technical information related to the building or manufactured home. Elevation data will not be considered under the procedures described in this section.

###### Data and other requirements.

(b)Items required for FEMA's review of a determination shall include the following:

(1) Payment of the required fee by check or money order, in U.S. funds, payable to the National Flood Insurance Program;

(2) A request for FEMA's review of the determination, signed by both the borrower and the lender;

(3) A copy of the lender's notification to the borrower that the building or manufactured home is in an SFHA and that flood insurance is required (the request for review of the determination must be postmarked within 45 days of borrower notification);

(4) A completed Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form for the building or manufactured home, together with a legible hard copy of all technical data used in making the determination; and

(5) A copy of the effective NFIP map (Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)) panel for the community in which the building or manufactured home is located, with the building or manufactured home location indicated. Portions of the map panel may be submitted but shall include the area of the building or manufactured home in question together with the map panel title block, including effective date, bar scale, and north arrow.

###### Review and response by FEMA.

(c)Within 45 days after receipt of a request to review a determination, FEMA will notify the applicants in writing of one of the following:

#### PART 72 - PROCEDURES AND FEES FOR PROCESSING MAP CHANGES

##### § 72.1 Purpose of part.

This part provides administrative and cost-recovery procedures for the engineering review and administrative processing associated with FEMA's response to requests for Conditional Letters of Map Amendment (CLOMAs), Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs), Conditional Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-Fs), Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-Fs), Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs), and Physical Map Revisions (PMRs). Such requests are based on proposed or actual manmade alterations within the floodplain, such as the placement of fill; modification of a channel; construction or modification of a bridge, culvert, levee, or similar measure; or construction of single or multiple residential or commercial structures on single or multiple lots.

##### § 72.2 Definitions.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, the definitions in 44 CFR part 59 are applicable to this part. For the purposes of this part, the products are defined as follows:

###### CLOMA.

A CLOMA is FEMA's comment on a proposed structure or group of structures that would, upon construction, be located on existing natural ground above the base (1-percent-annual-chance) flood elevation on a portion of a legally defined parcel of land that is partially inundated by the base flood.

###### CLOMR.

A CLOMR is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

###### CLOMR-F.

A CLOMR-F is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, result in a modification of the SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.

###### LOMR.

A LOMR is FEMA's modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), or both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA. The LOMR officially revises the FIRM or FBFM, and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and, when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.

###### LOMR-F.

A LOMR-F is FEMA's modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.

###### PMR.

A PMR is FEMA's physical revision and republication of an effective FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report. PMRs are generally based on physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA.

##### § 72.3 Fee schedule.

(a) For requests for CLOMRs, LOMRs, and PMRs based on structural measures on alluvial fans, an initial fee of $5,000, subject to the provisions of § 72.4, shall be paid to FEMA before FEMA begins its review of the request.

(ii) Include an estimate of the current replacement costs of such structures and their contents, or of their current economic value; and

(iii) Include an estimate of the anticipated annual loss due to flood damage.

(6) Provide the flood loss experience for State-owned structures and their contents based upon incurred losses for a period of not less than the 5 years immediately preceding application for exemption, and certify that such historical information shall be maintained and updated.

(7) Include, pursuant to § 60.12 of this subchapter, a certified copy of the flood plain management regulations setting forth standards for State-owned properties within A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.

(b) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall determine the adequacy of the insurance provisions whether they be based on available funds, an enforceable commitment of funds, commercial insurance, or some combination thereof, but has discretion to waive specific requirements under this part.

###### § 75.12 Application by a State for exemption.

Application for exemption made pursuant to this part shall be made by the Governor or other duly authorized official of the State accompanied by sufficient supporting documentation which certifies that the plan of self-insurance upon which the application for exemption is based meets or exceeds the standards set forth in § 75.11.

###### § 75.13 Review by the Federal Insurance Administrator.

(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator may return the application for exemption upon finding it incomplete or upon finding that additional information is required in order to make a determination as to the adequacy of the self-insurance plan.

##### § 77.7 Allowable costs.

###### General.

(a)General policies for allowable costs for implementing awards and subawards are addressed in 2 CFR 200.101, 200.102, 200.400-200.476.

###### Eligible management costs,Recipient.

(1)-(i)Recipients are eligible to receive management costs (direct and indirect administrative costs pursuant to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E) consisting of a maximum of 10 percent of the planning and project activities awarded to the recipient, each fiscal year under FMA. These costs must be included in the application to FEMA.

###### Subrecipient.

(ii)Subapplicants may include a maximum of 5 percent of the total funds requested for their subapplication for management costs to support the implementation of their planning or project activity. These costs must be included in the subapplication to the recipient.

###### Indirect costs.

(2)Indirect costs of administering the FMA program are eligible as part of the 10 percent management costs for the recipient or the 5 percent management costs of the subrecipient, but in no case do they make the recipient eligible for additional management costs that exceed the caps identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, all costs must be in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.

###### Pre-award costs.

(b)FEMA may fund eligible pre-award costs related to developing the application or subapplication at its discretion and as funds are available. Recipients and subrecipients may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project or planning proposal. Costs associated with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.

###### Duplication of benefits.

(c)Grant funds may not duplicate benefits received by or available to applicants, subapplicants and project participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity must notify the recipient and FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce the subaward by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.

###### Negligence or other tortious conduct.

(d)FEMA grant funds are not available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant, or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.

###### Legal obligations.

(e)FEMA grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court order, or State law.

##### § 77.8 Grant administration.

###### General.

(a)Recipients must comply with the requirements contained in 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002 and FEMA award requirements, including submission of performance and financial status reports. Recipients must also ensure that subrecipients are aware of and comply with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.

###### Cost overruns.

(b)(1) During the implementation of an approved grant, the recipient may find that actual costs are exceeding the approved award amount. While there is no guarantee of additional funding, FEMA will only consider requests made by the recipient to pay for such overruns if:

(i) Funds are available to meet the requested increase in funding; and

(ii) The amended grant award meets the eligibility requirements, including cost share requirements, identified in this section.

(2) Recipients may use cost underruns from ongoing subawards to offset overruns incurred by another subaward(s) awarded under the same award. All costs for which funding is requested must have been included in the original subapplication's cost estimate. In cases where an underrun is not available to cover an overrun, the Administrator may, with justification from the recipient and subrecipient, use other available FMA funds to cover the cost overrun.

(3) For all cost overruns that exceed the amount approved under the award, and which require additional Federal funds, the recipient must submit a written request with a recommendation, including a justification for the additional funding to the Regional Administrator for a determination. If approved, the Regional Administrator will increase the award through an amendment to the original award document.

###### Recapture.

(c)At the time of closeout, FEMA will recapture any funds provided to a State or a community under this part if the applicant has not provided the appropriate matching funds, the approved project has not been completed within the timeframes specified in the grant agreement, or the completed project does not meet the criteria specified in this part.

###### Remedies for noncompliance.

(d)FEMA may terminate an award or take other remedies for noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343.

###### Reconsideration.

(e)FEMA will reconsider determinations of noncompliance, additional award conditions, or its decision to terminate a Federal award. Requests for reconsideration must be made in writing to FEMA within 60 calendar days after receipt of a notice of the action, and in accordance with submission procedures set out in guidance. FEMA will notify the requester of the disposition of the request for reconsideration. If the decision is to grant the request for reconsideration, FEMA will take appropriate implementing action.

A project involving property acquisition or the relocation of structures for open space must be implemented consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart.

###### § 80.17 Project implementation.

####### Hazardous materials.

(a)The subrecipient must take steps to ensure it does not acquire or include in the project properties contaminated with hazardous materials by seeking information from property owners and from other sources on the use and presence of contaminants affecting the property from owners of properties that are or were industrial or commercial, or adjacent to such. A contaminated property must be certified clean prior to participation. This excludes permitted disposal of incidental demolition and household hazardous wastes. FEMA mitigation grant funds may not be used for clean up or remediation of contaminated properties.

####### Clear title.

(b)The subrecipient will obtain a title insurance policy demonstrating that fee title conveys to the subrecipient for each property to ensure that it acquires only a property with clear title. The property interest generally must transfer by a general warranty deed. Any incompatible easements or other encumbrances to the property must be extinguished before acquisition.

####### Purchase offer and supplemental payments.

(c)(1) The amount of purchase offer is the current market value of the property or the market value of the property immediately before the relevant event affecting the property ("pre-event").

(i) The relevant event for Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act assistance under HMGP is the major disaster under which funds are available; for assistance under the Pre-disaster Mitigation program (PDM) (42 U.S.C. 5133), it is the most recent major disaster. Where multiple disasters have affected the same property, the recipient and subrecipient will determine which is the relevant event.

(ii) The relevant event for assistance under the National Flood Insurance Act is the most recent event resulting in a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claim of at least $5,000.

(2) The recipient should coordinate with the subrecipient in their determination of whether the valuation should be based on pre-event or current market value. Generally, the same method to determine market value should be used for all participants in the project.

(3) A property owner who did not own the property at the time of the relevant event, or who is not a National of the United States or qualified alien, is not eligible for a purchase offer based on pre-event market value of the property. Subrecipients who offer pre-event market value to the property owner must have already obtained certification during the application process that the property owner is either a National of the United States or a qualified alien.

(4) Certain tenants who must relocate as a result of the project are entitled to relocation benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act (such as moving expenses, replacement housing rental payments, and relocation assistance advisory services) in accordance with 49 CFR part 24.

(5) If a purchase offer for a residential property is less than the cost of the homeowner-occupant to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling outside the hazard-prone area in the same community, subrecipients for mitigation grant programs may make such a payment available in accordance with criteria determined by the Administrator.

(6) The subrecipient must inform each property owner, in writing, of what it considers to be the market value of the property, the method of valuation and basis for the purchase offer, and the final offer amount. The offer will also clearly state that the property owner's participation in the project is voluntary.

####### Removal of existing buildings.

(d)Existing incompatible facilities must be removed by demolition or by relocation outside of the hazard area within 90 days of settlement of the property transaction. The FEMA Regional Administrator may grant an exception to this deadline only for a particular property based upon written justification if extenuating circumstances exist, but will specify a final date for removal.

####### Deed restriction.

(e)The subrecipient, upon settlement of the property transaction, must record with the deed of the subject property notice of applicable land use restrictions and related procedures described in this part, consistent with FEMA model deed restriction language.

###### § 80.19 Land use and oversight.

This section applies to acquisitions for open space projects to address flood hazards. If the Administrator determines to mitigate in other circumstances, he/she will adapt the provisions of this section as appropriate.

####### Open space requirements.

(a)The property must be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity as open space for the conservation of natural floodplain functions.

(1) These uses may include: Parks for outdoor recreational activities; wetlands management; nature reserves; cultivation; grazing; camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation); unimproved, unpaved parking lots; buffer zones; and other uses FEMA determines compatible with this part.

(i) Allowable uses generally do not include: Walled buildings, levees, dikes, or floodwalls, paved roads, highways, bridges, cemeteries, landfills, storage of any hazardous or toxic materials, above or below ground pumping and switching stations, above or below ground storage tanks, paved parking, off-site fill or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.

(ii) In the rare circumstances where the Administrator has determined competing Federal interests were unavoidable and has analyzed floodplain impacts for compliance with § 60.3 of this subchapter or higher standards, the Administrator may find only USACE projects recognized by FEMA in 2000 and improvements to pre-existing Federal-aid transportation systems to be allowable uses.

(2) No new structures or improvements will be built on the property except as indicated below:

(i) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;

(ii) A public restroom; or

(iii) A structure that is compatible with open space and conserves the natural function of the floodplain, which the Administrator approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.

(3) Any improvements on the property must be in accordance with proper floodplain management policies and practices. Structures built on the property according to paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be floodproofed or elevated to at least the base flood level plus 1 foot of freeboard, or greater, if required by FEMA, or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator.

(4) After the date of property settlement, no Federal entity or source may provide disaster assistance for any purpose with respect to the property, nor may any application for such assistance be made to any Federal entity or source.

(5) The property is not eligible for coverage under the NFIP for damage to structures on the property occurring after the date of the property settlement, except for pre-existing structures being relocated off the property as a result of the project.

####### Subsequent transfer.

(b)After acquiring the property interest, the subrecipient, including successors in interest, will convey any interest in the property only if the Regional Administrator, through the State, gives prior written approval of the transferee in accordance with this paragraph.

(1) The request by the subrecipient, through the State, to the Regional Administrator must include a signed statement from the proposed transferee that it acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the terms of this section, and documentation of its status as a qualified conservation organization if applicable.

(2) The subrecipient may convey a property interest only to a public entity or to a qualified conservation organization. However, the subrecipient may convey an easement or lease to a private individual or entity for purposes compatible with the uses described in paragraph (a) of this section, with the prior approval of the Regional Administrator, and so long as the conveyance does not include authority to control and enforce the terms and conditions of this section.

(3) If title to the property is transferred to a public entity other than one with a conservation mission, it must be conveyed subject to a conservation easement that must be recorded with the deed and must incorporate all terms and conditions set forth in this section, including the easement holder's responsibility to enforce the easement. This must be accomplished by one of the following means:

(i) The subrecipient will convey, in accordance with this paragraph (b), a conservation easement to an entity other than the title holder, which must be recorded with the deed, or

(ii) At the time of title transfer, the subrecipient will retain such conservation easement, and record it with the deed.

(4) Conveyance of any property interest must reference and incorporate the original deed restrictions providing notice of the conditions in this section and must incorporate a provision for the property interest to revert to the subrecipient or recipient in the event that the transferee ceases to exist or loses its eligible status under this section.

####### Inspection.

(c)FEMA, its representatives and assigns, including the recipient will have the right to enter upon the property, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice, for the purpose of inspecting the property to ensure compliance with the terms of this part, the property conveyance and of the grant award.

####### Monitoring and reporting.

(d)Every 3 years the subrecipient (in coordination with any current successor in interest) through the recipient, must submit to the FEMA Regional Administrator a report certifying that the subrecipient has inspected the property within the month preceding the report, and that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of this part, the property conveyance and the grant award.

####### Enforcement.

(e)The subrecipient, recipient, FEMA, and their respective representatives, successors and assigns, are responsible for taking measures to bring the property back into compliance if the property is not maintained according to the terms of this part, the conveyance, and the grant award. The relative rights and responsibilities of FEMA, the recipient, the subrecipient, and subsequent holders of the property interest at the time of enforcement, include the following:

(1) The recipient will notify the subrecipient and any current holder of the property interest in writing and advise them that they have 60 days to correct the violation. If the subrecipient or any current holder of the property interest fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to come into compliance with the terms of the grant within the 60-day period, the recipient will enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to bringing an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(2) FEMA, its representatives, and assignees may enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to 1 or more of the following:

(i) Withholding FEMA mitigation awards or assistance from the State and subrecipient; and current holder of the property interest.

(ii) Requiring transfer of title. The subrecipient or the current holder of the property interest will bear the costs of bringing the property back into compliance with the terms of the grant; or

(iii) Bringing an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction against any or all of the following parties: The recipient, the subrecipient, and their respective successors.

#### PART 151 - REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF FIREFIGHTING ON FEDERAL PROPERTY

##### Subpart A - Purpose, Scope, Definitions

###### § 151.01 Purpose.

Section 11 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, provides that "each fire service that engages in the fighting of a fire on property which is under the jurisdiction of the United States may file a claim with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the amount of direct expenses and direct losses incurred by such fire service as a result of fighting such fire." This part, implements section 11 of the Act and governs the submission, determination, and appeal of claims under section 11.

###### § 151.02 Scope.

Fire services, in any State, may file claims for reimbursement under section 11 and this part for the direct expenses and losses which are additional firefighting costs over and above normal operating costs incurred while fighting a fire on property which is under the jurisdiction of the United States. Section 11 requires that certain payments be deducted from those costs and that the Treasury Department will ordinarily pay the amount resulting from the application of that formula. Where the United States has entered into a contract (which is not a mutual aid agreement, defined in § 151.03) for the provision of fire protection, and it is the intent of the parties that reimbursement under section 11 is unavailable, this intent will normally govern. Where a mutual aid agreement is in effect between the claimant and an agency of the United States for the property upon which the fire occurred, reimbursement will be available in otherwise proper situations. However, any payments (including the value of services) rendered under the agreement during the term of the agreement (or the Federal fiscal year in which the fire occurred, if no term is discernible) shall be deducted from the costs claimed, pursuant to § 151.12.

Upon receipt of notification of rejection, the Administrator shall reconsider his determination and notify the claimant of the results of the reconsideration. The amount determined on reconsideration will constitute the costs to be used by the Administrator in determining the reimbursable amount.

(c) Upon receipt of documentation from the claimant on the amount of payments the Federal Government has made for the support of fire services on the property in question, the Administrator will, following such verification or investigation as the Administrator may deem appropriate, calculate the full amount to be reimbursed under the section 11 formula as set forth in § 151.12(a). This calculation of the reimbursable amount is based upon the costs determined pursuant to § 151.12(b) and the documentation of Federal payments that the claimant submitted.

(d) The Administrator's determination of the reimbursable amount will be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon receipt of the claim and determination made under § 151.12 (a), (b), and (c), determine the amount authorized for payment, which shall be the amount actually available for payment from any monies in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated but subject to reimbursement (from any appropriations which may be available or which may be made available for the purpose) by the Federal department or agency under whose jurisdiction the fire occurred. This shall be a sum no greater, although it may be less, that the reimbursable amount determined by the Administrator, FEMA, with respect to the claim under § 151.12 (a), (b) and (c).

(e) Upon receipt of written notification from the claimant of its intention to accept the amount authorized as full settlement of the claim, accompanied by a properly executed document of release, the Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's determination and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount authorized.

(f) Subject to the discovery of additional material evidence, the Administrator may reconsider any determination in this section, whether or not made as his final determination.

###### § 151.13 Reconsideration of amount authorized for payment.

(a) If the claimant elects to protest the amount authorized for payment, after the applicable procedures of § 151.12 have been followed, it must within 30 days of receipt of notification of the amount authorized notify the Administrator in writing of its objections and set forth the reasons why the Administrator should reconsider the determination. The Administrator will upon notice of protest and receipt of additional evidence reconsider the determination of the amount of Federal payments under § 151.12(a)(2) but not the determination of the amount of costs under § 151.12(a)(1). The Administrator shall cause a reconsideration by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount actually available and authorized for payment by the Treasury. The Administrator, upon receipt of the Secretary of the Treasury's reconsidered determination, will notify the claimant in writing of the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement of the claim.

(b) If the claimant elects to accept the amount authorized, upon reconsideration, for payment in full settlement of its claims, it must within 30 days (or a longer period of time acceptable to the Administrator) of its receipt of that determination notify the Administrator of its acceptance in writing accompanied by a properly executed document of release. Upon receipt of such notice and document of release, the Administrator will forward the claim, a copy of the Administrator's final determination, and the claimant's document of release to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of the claim in the amount of final authorization.

###### § 151.14 Adjudication.

If the claimant, after written notice by the Administrator of the amount authorized for payment in full settlement of the claim and after all applicable procedures of §§ 151.12 and 151.13 have been followed elects to dispute the amount authorized, it may then initiate action in the United States Claims Court, which shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and enter judgment in accordance with section 11(d) of the Act.

##### Subpart C - Administration, Penalties

###### § 151.21 [Reserved]

###### § 151.22 Audits.

At the discretion of the Administrator, all claims submitted under section 11 of the Act and all records of the claimant will be subject to audit by the Administrator or his/her designee. In addition, the Comptroller General of the United States or his/her designee shall have access to all books and records of all claimants making claims under section 11.

###### § 151.23 Penalties.

Claimant's officials or others who provide information or documentation under this part are subject to, among other laws, the criminal penalties of Title 18 of the United States Code, sections 287 and 1001, which punish the submission of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims and the making of false, fictitious or fraudulent statements and which provide for a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. For such a violation, the person is likewise subject to the civil penalties set out in 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 3730.

#### PART 152 - ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS GRANT PROGRAM

##### § 152.1 Purpose and eligible uses of grant funds.

(a) This competitive grant program will provide funding directly to fire departments of a State for the purpose of enhancing departments abilities to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of firefighting personnel, facing fire and fire-related hazards. Eligible applicants can submit only one application per application period. Departments that submit multiple applications in one application period will have each of their applications deemed ineligible.

###### i.e.,

(b) Eligible applicants are fire departments or fire departments of a State which is defined as an agency or organization that has a "formally recognized arrangement" with a State, local or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do so, e.g., where the fire department falls within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non-Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local jurisdiction to provide fire suppression, on a first-due basis, outside the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program. Fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire departments that are for-profit departments (do not have specific non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to apply for assistance under this program. Also not eligible for this program are ambulance services, rescue squads, auxiliaries, dive teams, urban search and rescue teams, fire service organizations or associations, and State/local agencies such as a forest service, fire marshal, hospitals, and training offices.

(c) Congress included in the legislation a list of fourteen activities eligible for funding under this program. Those activities are as follows:

(1) To hire additional firefighting personnel;

(2) To train firefighting personnel in firefighting, emergency response (including response to a terrorism incident or use of a weapon of mass destruction), arson prevention and detection, or the handling of hazardous materials, or to train firefighting personnel to provide any of the training in this paragraph (c);

(3) To fund the creation of rapid intervention teams to protect firefighting personnel at scenes of fires and other emergencies;

(4) To certify fire inspectors;

(5) To establish wellness and fitness programs for firefighting personnel to ensure that the firefighting personnel can carry out their duties;

(6) To fund emergency medical services provided by fire departments;

(7) To acquire additional firefighting vehicles, including fire trucks;

(8) To acquire additional firefighting equipment, including equipment for communications, monitoring, and response to a terrorism incident or use of a weapon of mass destruction;

(9) To acquire personal protective equipment required for firefighting personnel by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other personal protective equipment for firefighting personnel, including protective equipment to respond to a terrorism incident or the use of a weapon of mass destruction;

(10) To modify fire stations, fire training facilities, and other facilities to protect the health and safety of firefighting personnel;

(11) To enforce fire codes;

(12) To fund fire prevention programs;

(13) To educate the public about arson prevention and detection; and

(14) To provide incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighting personnel for volunteer firefighting departments and other firefighting departments that utilize volunteers.

(d) The specific activities that will be eligible for funding will be announced in the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.

Often this agreement is recognized or reported to the appropriate State entity with cognizance over fire departments, such as registration with the State Fire Marshal's office, or the agreement is specifically contained in the fire department's or jurisdiction's charter.

Integrated communication systems and devices are equipment or systems for dispatch centers or communication infrastructure. Examples of these include 911 systems, computer-aided dispatch systems, global positioning systems, fixed repeaters, etc. Towers are an integral part of any communication system, but they are not eligible to be included in any award under this program.

###### New mission

is a first-responder function that a department has never delivered in the past or that was once delivered but has since been abandoned by the department due to the lack of funding or community support. Examples include technical search and rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous materials response, etc. A new mission does not include services already provided from existing facilities. Opening additional stations to provide similar services would be considered an expansion of existing services.

###### Population

##### § 152.3 Availability of funds.

(a) Fire departments that have received funding under the Assistance to Firefighter Grant Program in previous years are eligible to apply for funding in the current year. However, due to our responsibilities under this program to assure adequate distribution of awards amongst certain types of departments (career, combination and volunteer) and certain types of communities (urban, suburban or rural) as well as an equitable geographic distribution, we reserve the right to fund or not to fund previous recipients of grants under this program in order for us to fulfill these responsibilities.

(b) No applicant can receive more than $750,000 in Federal grant funds under this program in any fiscal year.

(c) No applicant can submit more than one application per fiscal year. Applicants that submit multiple applications will have each of their applications deemed ineligible.

(d) The scoring of the applications will determine the distribution of the funding across the eligible programs. Notwithstanding anything in this part, no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the funds appropriated for grants shall be used to assist grant recipients to purchase firefighting vehicles and not less than five (5) percent of the funds shall be used for fire prevention programs.

(e) We will not provide assistance under this part for activities for which another Federal agency has more specific or primary authority to provide assistance for the same purpose. We may disallow or recoup amounts that fall within other Federal agency's authority.

(1) Share in the costs of the projects funded under this grant program. Fire departments in areas serving populations over 50,000 must agree to match the Federal grant funds with an amount of non-Federal funds equal to thirty (30) percent of the total project cost. Fire departments serving areas with a population of 50,000 or less will have to match the Federal grant funds with an amount of non-Federal funds equal to ten (10) percent of the total project cost. No waivers of this requirement will be granted except for fire departments of Insular Areas as provided for in 48 U.S.C. 1469a.

(2) Maintain operating expenditures during the grant's period of performance in the areas funded by a grant at a level equal to or greater than the average of their operating expenditures in the two years preceding the year in which this assistance is received.

(3) Obtain the appropriate Federal, State, or local permits necessary to fulfill the grant's scope of work including historical and/or environmental clearances as required.

(4) Retain grant files and supporting documentation for three years after the official closeout of the grant.

(6) Maintain documentation to support the expenditure of grant funds as well as pertinent grant decisions.

(7) Make their grant files and other books and records related to the grant, available if requested for an audit to ensure compliance with any requirement of the grant program.

(8) Agree to provide information to the U.S. Fire Administration's National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the grant. If a grantee does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month period commencing as soon as they develop the capacity to report. Capacity to report to the NFIRS must be established prior to the termination of the one-year performance period.

(c) FEMA activities:

(1) We will ensure that the funds are awarded based on the priorities and expected benefits articulated in the statute, this part, USFA's strategic plan, and the Notice of Funds Availability.

(2) We will ensure that not more than twenty-five (25) percent of the appropriated funding will be used to purchase firefighting vehicles.

(3) We will ensure that not less than five (5) percent of the funds are made available to national, State, local, or community organizations, including fire departments, for the purpose of carrying out fire prevention programs.

(4) We will ensure that fire departments with volunteer staff, or staff comprised of a combination of career fire fighters and volunteers, receive a proportion of the total grant funding that is not less than the proportion of the United States population that those firefighting departments protect.

(5) We will ensure that grants are made to fire departments located in urban, suburban, and rural communities.

(6) We will strive to ensure geographic diversity of awards as stipulated in § 152.6.

(7) We will strive to ensure that activities funded under this grant program are consistent with the programs goals and intent, and generally in the government's best interest.

(8) We will provide the chief executives of the States with information concerning the total number and dollar amount of awards made to fire departments in their States; the program areas and activities supported by these grants; and other information about specific awards when generated and available.

##### § 152.5 Review process and evaluation criteria.

(a) Every application will be evaluated based on the answers to the activity-specific questions during our initial screening. The applications that are determined to best address the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's established priorities during this initial screening will be in the "competitive range" and subject to a second level of review. We will use the narratives/supplemental information provided by the applicants in their grant applications to evaluate, on a competitive basis, the merits and benefits of each request for funding. In selecting applications for award, we will evaluate each application for assistance independently based on established eligibility criteria and the program priorities. Eligible applicants that best address the priorities will advance to a second level of review. The second level of review involves an assessment of the financial needs of the applicant, and an analysis of the benefits that would result from the grant award.

(b) In order to be successful at this second level of the evaluation, an applicant must complete the narrative section of the application package. The narrative should include a detailed description of the planned program, uses for the grant funds including details of each budget line item. For example, if personnel costs are included in the budget, please provide a break down of what those costs are for. The narrative should explain why the grant funds are needed and why the department has not been able to obtain funding for the planned activities on its own. A discussion of financial need should include a discussion of any Federal funding received for similar activities. Finally, the applicant's narrative should detail the benefits the department or community will realize as a result of the grant award.

(c) This second level of review will be conducted using a panel of technical evaluation panelists. These panelists are largely made up of non-Federal experts with a fire service background. The panelists will assess the application's merits with respect to the clarity and detail provided in the narrative about the project, the applicant's financial need, and the project's purported benefit to be derived from the cost. Technical evaluation panelists will independently score each application before them and then discuss the merits/shortcomings of the application in an effort to reconcile any major discrepancies. A consensus on the score is not required. The highest scoring applications resulting from this second level of review will then be considered for award. We seek to maximize the benefits derived from the funding by crediting applicants with the greatest financial need and whose proposed activities provide the greatest benefit versus the cost.

(d) In addition to the project narrative, the applicant must provide an itemized budget detailing the use of the grant funds. If an applicant is seeking funds in more than one eligible activity within a program, separate budgets will have to be generated for each activity and then an overall or summary budget will have to be generated. For those applicants applying on line, the summary budget will be automatically generated by the e-grants system.

(e) Specific rating criteria for each of the eligible programs will be published in a Notice of Funding Availability that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.

##### § 152.6 Application review and award process.

(a) As stated in § 152.5, we will evaluate each application in the preliminary screening process to determine which applications best address the program's established priorities. The best applications as determined in this preliminary step will be deemed to be in the "competitive range." All applications in the competitive range will advance to a second level review by a technical evaluation panel. Using the evaluation criteria detailed in the Program Guidance and in the NOFA (both of which are published pursuant to this program's annual appropriation), the panelists will score each application they evaluate. The assigned score will reflect the degree to which the applicant: clearly relates their proposed project; demonstrates financial need; and, details a high benefit to cost value of the proposed activities. We will provide the panelists the complete application content for their evaluation. We will also provide them with reference materials for national standards or regulations and guidelines with respect to typical costs for proposed apparatus and equipment purchases.

###### i.e.,

(b) Our award decisions will be based on the stated priorities of the grant program first, then on the demonstrated need of the applicant and the benefits to be derived from the proposed projects. We will make awards on a competitive basis,we will fund the highest scored applications before considering lower scored applications.

(c) In a few cases, to fulfill our obligations under the law to make grants to a variety of departments, we may also make funding decisions using rank order as the preliminary basis, and then analyze the type of fire department (paid, volunteer, or combination fire departments), the size and character of the community it serves (urban, suburban, or rural), and/or the geographic location of the fire department. In these instances where we are making decisions based on geographic location, we will use States as the basic geographic unit. We may also base our funding decisions on previous grant awards funded by this program and/or grantees' performance on previous grants and a technical evaluation of reasonable costs for labor, services, materials or equipment.

##### § 152.7 Grant payment, reporting and other requirements.

(a) Grantees will have twelve months to incur obligations and complete the scope of work to fulfill their responsibilities under this grant program. The performance period of each grant will be detailed in the Articles of Agreement that we provide each grantee. Grantees may request funds from FEMA as reimbursement for expenditures made under the grant program or they may request funds for immediate cash needs under 2 CFR 200.305. Advances of funds may also be approved to meet immediate cash needs.

(b) Generally, fire departments cannot use grant funds to pay for products and services contracted for, or purchased prior to the effective date of the grant. However, we will consider requests for reimbursement for these on an exception basis. Expenses incurred after the application deadline but prior to award may be eligible for reimbursement if the expenses were justified, unavoidable (i.e., urgent and compelling), consistent with the scope of work, and specifically approved by the Assistance Officer. Expenses, obligations, commitments or contracts incurred or entered into prior to the application deadline are not eligible to be included as an expense.

(c) All grantees must follow their own established procurement process when buying anything with Federal grant funds as provided in 2 CFR 200.317-200.326. If the grantee does not have an established procurement process, they must seek a minimum of two bids for any acquisition.

(d) When requesting funding, grantees can only request an amount that is necessary to satisfy their immediate cash needs directly related to the grant, i.e., an amount equal to the total eligible grant expenses due within 30 days. Grantees can request payments of up to one hundred (100) percent of the federal share of the award amount but only if delivery of the ordered products and/or services is imminent (approximately 30 days) and the resulting payment will require the entire amount of funds.

(e) A grantee may request sufficient funding for a down payment if required to do so by the seller, such as in grants involving some purchases of firefighting vehicles. The grantee may request as much as fifty (50) percent of the federal share of the award amount at the time of the order placement to pay the down payment. The grantee may request the balance of the federal share upon delivery of the ordered equipment or vehicle.

(f) The recipients of funding under this program must report to us on how the grant funding was used and the benefits that resulted. This will be accomplished via submission of performance reports. Details regarding the reporting requirements will be provided in the Articles of Agreement provided to each grantee.

(g) Fire departments that receive funding under this program must agree to provide information to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the assistance. If a grantee does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month period commencing as soon as possible after they develop the capacity to report. Capacity to report to the NFIRS must be established prior to the termination of the one-year performance period.

##### § 152.8 Application submission and deadline.

In each year that this program is authorized and receives an appropriation, we will announce the grants availability via Notice of Funds Availability. That Notice will contain all pertinent information concerning the eligible funding activities, funding priorities, funding levels, application period, timelines, and deadlines.

##### § 152.9 Reconsideration.

###### Reconsideration of initial grant award decisions.

(a)We will review our decision with respect to an initial grant award decision only when the applicant asserts that we have made a material technical or procedural error in the processing of the application and can substantiate such assertions. As grants are awarded on a competitive basis, in accordance with the findings of an independent panel of experts, we cannot consider requests for reconsideration based upon the merits of an original application. Similarly, we will not consider new information provided after the submission of the original application. In the case of new information, we encourage applicants to incorporate their changed circumstances into their applications for future grant cycles.

###### Reconsideration of other decisions.

(b)We will consider requests for reconsideration of decisions other than those related to the initial grant award on their merits.

(c) We must receive a request for reconsideration under this section within 60 days of the date of the notice of the decision for which reconsideration is requested.

(d) Requests for reconsideration should be directed to: Assistant Administrator, Grant Programs Directorate, Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, FEMA, 800 K Street, NW., South Tower 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20001.

If the applicant suspects negligence by a third party for causing a condition for which FEMA made assistance available under this Part, the applicant is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the negligence of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available to the recipient or subrecipient, and will treat them consistent with (a) of this section.

####### Intentional acts.

(d)Any person who intentionally causes a condition for which assistance is provided under this part shall be liable to the United States to the extent that FEMA incurs costs attributable to the intentional act or omission that caused the condition. FEMA may provide assistance under this part, but it will be conditioned on an agreement by the applicant to cooperate with FEMA in efforts to recover the cost of the assistance from the liable party. A person shall not be liable under this section as a result of actions the person takes or omits in the course of rendering care or assistance in response to the fire.

###### § 204.63 Allowable costs.

###### §§ 206.18-206.30 [Reserved]

##### Subpart B - The Declaration Process

###### § 206.31 Purpose.

The purpose of this subpart is to describe the process leading to a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or an emergency and the actions triggered by such a declaration.

###### § 206.32 Definitions.

All definitions in the Stafford Act and in § 206.2 apply. In addition, the following definitions apply:

####### Appeal:

(a)A request for reconsideration of a determination on any action related to Federal assistance under the Stafford Act and these regulations. Specific procedures for appeals are contained in the relevant subparts of these regulations.

####### Commitment:

(b)A certification by the Governor that the State and local governments will expend a reasonable amount of funds to alleviate the effects of the major disaster or emergency, for which no Federal reimbursement will be requested.

####### Disaster Application Center:

(c)A center established in a centralized location within the disaster area for individuals, families, or businesses to apply for disaster aid.

####### FEMA-State Agreement:

(d)A formal legal document stating the understandings, commitments, and binding conditions for assistance applicable as the result of the major disaster or emergency declared by the President.

####### Incident:

(e)Any condition which meets the definition of major disaster or emergency as set forth in § 206.2 which causes damage or hardship that may result in a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or an emergency.

####### Incident period:

(f)The time interval during which the disaster-causing incident occurs. No Federal assistance under the Act shall be approved unless the damage or hardship to be alleviated resulted from the disaster-causing incident which took place during the incident period or was in anticipation of that incident. The incident period will be established by FEMA in the FEMA-State Agreement and published in the

###### § 206.33 Preliminary damage assessment.

The preliminary damage assessment (PDA) process is a mechanism used to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and the resulting unmet needs of individuals, businesses, the public sector, and the community as a whole. Information collected is used by the State as a basis for the Governor's request, and by FEMA to document the recommendation made to the President in response to the Governor's request. It is in the best interest of all parties to combine State and Federal personnel resources by performing a joint PDA prior to the initiation of a Governor's request, as follows.

####### Preassessment by the State.

(a)When an incident occurs, or is imminent, which the State official responsible for disaster operations determines may be beyond the State and local government capabilities to respond, the State will request the Regional Administrator to perform a joint FEMA-State preliminary damage assessment. It is not anticipated that all occurrences will result in the requirement for assistance; therefore, the State will be expected to verify their initial information, in some manner, before requesting this support.

####### Damage assessment teams.

(b)Damage assessment teams will be composed of at least one representative of the Federal Government and one representative of the State. A local government representative, familiar with the extent and location of damage in his/her community, should also be included, if possible. Other State and Federal agencies, and voluntary relief organizations may also be asked to participate, as needed. It is the State's responsibility to coordinate State and local participation in the PDA and to ensure that the participants receive timely notification concerning the schedule. A FEMA official will brief team members on damage criteria, the kind of information to be collected for the particular incident, and reporting requirements.

####### Review of findings.

(c)At the close of the PDA, FEMA will consult with State officials to discuss findings and reconcile any differences.

####### Exceptions.

(d)The requirement for a joint PDA may be waived for those incidents of unusual severity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessments to determine the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Act, or in such other instances determined by the Regional Administrator upon consultation with the State. It may be necessary, however, to conduct an assessment to determine unmet needs for managerial response purposes.

###### § 206.34 Request for utilization of Department of Defense (DOD) resources.

####### General.

(a)During the immediate aftermath of an incident which may ultimately qualify for a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, when threats to life and property are present which cannot be effectively dealt with by the State or local governments, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may direct DOD to utilize DOD personnel and equipment for removal of debris and wreckage and temporary restoration of essential public facilities and services.

####### Request process.

(b)The Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request such DOD assistance. The Governor should submit the request to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 48 hours of the occurrence of the incident. Requests made after that time may still be considered if information is submitted indicating why the request for assistance could not be made during the initial 48 hours. The request shall include:

(1) Information describing the types and amount of DOD emergency assistance being requested;

(2) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;

(3) A finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary for the preservation of life and property;

(4) A certification by the Governor that the State and local government will reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal share of the cost of such work; and

(5) An agreement:

(i) To provide all lands, easements and rights-of-way necessary to accomplish the approved work without cost to the United States;

(ii) To hold and save the United States free from damages due to the requested work, and to indemnify the Federal government against any claims arising from such work; and

(iii) To assist DOD in all support and local jurisdictional matters.

####### Processing the request.

(c)Upon receipt of the request, the Regional Administrator shall gather adequate information to support a recommendation and forward it to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. If the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that such work is essential to save lives and protect property, he/she will issue a mission assignment to DOD authorizing direct Federal assistance to the extent deemed appropriate.

####### Implementation of assistance.

(d)The performance of emergency work may not exceed a period of 10 days from the date of the mission assignment.

####### Limits.

(e)Generally, no work shall be approved under this section which falls within the statutory authority of DOD or another Federal agency. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under this section of the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude the authorization of DOD assistance by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

####### Federal share.

(f)The Federal share of assistance under this section shall be not less than 75 percent of the cost of eligible work.

####### Project management.

(g)DOD shall ensure that the work is completed in accordance with the approved scope of work, costs, and time limitations in the mission assignment. DOD shall also keep the Regional Administrator and the State advised of work progress and other project developments. It is the responsibility of DOD to ensure compliance with applicable Federal, State and local legal requirements. A final report will be submitted to the Regional Administrator upon termination of all direct Federal assistance work. Final reports shall be signed by a representative of DOD and the State. Once the final eligible cost is determined, DOD will request reimbursement from FEMA and FEMA will submit a bill to the State for the non-Federal share of the mission assignment.

####### Reimbursement of DOD.

(h)Reimbursement will be made in accordance with § 206.8 of these regulations.

###### § 206.35 Requests for emergency declarations.

(a) When an incident occurs or threatens to occur in a State, which would not qualify under the definition of a major disaster, the Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request that the President declare an emergency. The Governor should submit the request to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 5 days after the need for assistance under title V becomes apparent, but no longer than 30 days after the occurrence of the incident, in order to be considered. The period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request for such extension is made by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during the 30-day period immediately following the incident. The extension request must stipulate the reason for the delay.

(b) The basis for the Governor's request must be the finding that the situation:

(1) Is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capability of the State and the affected local government(s); and

(2) Requires supplementary Federal emergency assistance to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster.

(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:

(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;

(2) Information describing the State and local efforts and resources which have been or will be used to alleviate the emergency;

(3) Information describing other Federal agency efforts and resources which have been or will be used in responding to this incident; and

(4) Identification of the type and extent of additional Federal aid required.

####### Modified declaration for Federal emergencies.

(d)The requirement for a Governor's request under paragraph (a) of this section can be waived when an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility rests in the Federal government because the emergency involves a subject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the Federal government exercises exclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority. Any party may bring the existence of such a situation to the attention of the FEMA Regional Administrator. Any recommendation for a Presidential declaration of emergency in the absence of a Governor's request must be initiated by the Regional Administrator or transmitted through the Regional Administrator by another Federal agency. In determining that such an emergency exists, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or Regional Administrator shall consult the Governor of the affected State, if practicable.

####### Other authorities.

(e)It is not intended for an emergency declaration to preempt other Federal agency authorities and/or established plans and response mechanisms in place prior to the enactment of the Stafford Act.

###### § 206.36 Requests for major disaster declarations.

(a) When a catastrophe occurs in a State, the Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request a major disaster declaration. The Governor should submit the request to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 30 days of the occurrence of the incident in order to be considered. The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, provided that a written request for an extension is submitted by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during this 30-day period. The extension request will stipulate reasons for the delay.

(b) The basis for the request shall be a finding that:

(1) The situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments; and

(2) Federal assistance under the Act is necessary to supplement the efforts and available resources of the State, local governments, disaster relief organizations, and compensation by insurance for disaster-related losses.

(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:

(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;

(2) An estimate of the amount and severity of damages and losses stating the impact of the disaster on the public and private sector;

(3) Information describing the nature and amount of State and local resources which have been or will be committed to alleviate the results of the disaster;

(4) Preliminary estimates of the types and amount of supplementary Federal disaster assistance needed under the Stafford Act; and

(5) Certification by the Governor that State and local government obligations and expenditures for the current disaster will comply with all applicable cost sharing requirements of the Stafford Act.

(d) For those catastrophes of unusual severity and magnitude when field damage assessments are not necessary to determine the requirement for supplemental Federal assistance, the Governor or Acting Governor may send an abbreviated written request through the Regional Administrator for a declaration of a major disaster. This may be transmitted in the most expeditious manner available. In the event the FEMA Regional Office is severely impacted by the catastrophe, the request may be addressed to the Administrator of FEMA. The request must indicate a finding in accordance with § 206.36(b), and must include as a minimum the information requested by § 206.36 (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5). Upon receipt of the request, FEMA shall expedite the processing of reports and recommendations to the President. Notification to the Governor of the Presidential declaration shall be in accordance with 44 CFR 206.39. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorateshall assure that documentation of the declaration is later assembled to comply fully with these regulations.

###### § 206.37 Processing requests for declarations of a major disaster or emergency.

####### Acknowledgment.

(a)The Regional Administrator shall provide written acknowledgment of the Governor's request.

####### Regional summary.

(b)Based on information obtained by FEMA/State preliminary damage assessments of the affected area(s) and consultations with appropriate State and Federal officials and other interested parties, the Regional Administrator shall promptly prepare a summary of the PDA findings. The data will be analyzed and submitted with a recommendation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Analysis shall include a discussion of State and local resources and capabilities, and other assistance available to meet the major disaster or emergency-related needs.

####### FEMA recommendation.

(c)Based on all available information, the Administrator shall formulate a recommendation which shall be forwarded to the President with the Governor's request.

####### Major disaster recommendation.

(1)The recommendation will be based on a finding that the situation is or is not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the State and its local governments. It will also contain a determination of whether or not supplemental Federal assistance under the Stafford Act is necessary and appropriate. In developing a recommendation, FEMA will consider such factors as the amount and type of damages; the impact of damages on affected individuals, the State, and local governments; the available resources of the State and local governments, and other disaster relief organizations; the extent and type of insurance in effect to cover losses; assistance available from other Federal programs and other sources; imminent threats to public health and safety; recent disaster history in the State; hazard mitigation measures taken by the State or local governments, especially implementation of measures required as a result of previous major disaster declarations; and other factors pertinent to a given incident.

####### Emergency recommendation.

(2)The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate whether or not Federal emergency assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act is necessary to supplement State and local efforts to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. Only after it has been determined that all other resources and authorities available to meet the crisis are inadequate, and that assistance provided in section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate, will FEMA recommend an emergency declaration to the President.

####### Modified Federal emergency recommendation.

(d)The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate that an emergency does or does not exist for which assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate. An emergency declaration will not be recommended in situations where the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more Federal agencies without a Presidential declaration. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude a declaration of an emergency under the Act.

###### § 206.38 Presidential determination.

(a) The Governor's request for a major disaster declaration may result in either a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, or denial of the Governor's request.

(b) The Governor's request for an emergency declaration may result only in a Presidential declaration of an emergency, or denial of the Governor's request.

###### § 206.39 Notification.

(a) The Governor will be promptly notified by the Administrator or his/her designee of a declaration by the President that an emergency or a major disaster exists. FEMA also will notify other Federal agencies and other interested parties.

(b) The Governor will be promptly notified by the Administrator or his/her designee of a determination that the Governor's request does not justify the use of the authorities of the Stafford Act.

(c) Following a major disaster or emergency declaration, the Regional Administrator or the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate will promptly notify the Governor of the designations of assistance and areas eligible for such assistance.

###### § 206.40 Designation of affected areas and eligible assistance.

####### Eligible assistance.

(a)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has been delegated authority to determine and designate the types of assistance to be made available. The initial designations will usually be announced in the declaration. Determinations by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate of the types and extent of FEMA disaster assistance to be provided are based upon findings whether the damage involved and its effects are of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the response capabilities of the State, the affected local governments, and other potential recipients of supplementary Federal assistance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize all, or only particular types of, supplementary Federal assistance requested by the Governor.

####### Areas eligible to receive assistance.

(b)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate also has been delegated authority to designate the affected areas eligible for supplementary Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. These designations shall be published in theAn affected area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate includes all local government jurisdictions within its boundaries. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may, based upon damage assessments in any given area, designate all or only some of the areas requested by the Governor for supplementary Federal assistance.

####### Requests for additional designations after a declaration.

(c)After a declaration by the President, the Governor, or the GAR, may request that additional areas or types of supplementary Federal assistance be authorized by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Such requests shall be accompanied by appropriate verified assessments and commitments by State and local governments to demonstrate that the requested designations are justified and that the unmet needs are beyond State and local capabilities without supplementary Federal assistance. Additional assistance or areas added to the declaration will be published in the

####### Time limits to request.

(d)In order to be considered, all supplemental requests under paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within 30 days from the termination date of the incident, or 30 days after the declaration, whichever is later. The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request is made by the appropriate State official during this 30-day period. The request must include justification of the State's inability to meet the deadline.

###### § 206.41 Appointment of disaster officials.

####### Federal Coordinating Officer.

(a)Upon a declaration of a major disaster or of an emergency by the President, the Administrator or Deputy Administrator shall appoint an FCO who shall initiate action immediately to assure that Federal assistance is provided in accordance with the declaration, applicable laws, regulations, and the FEMA-State Agreement.

####### Disaster Recovery Manager.

(b)The Regional Administrator shall designate a DRM to exercise all the authority of the Regional Administrator in a major disaster or an emergency.

####### State Coordinating Officer.

(c)Upon a declaration of a major disaster or of an emergency, the Governor of the affected State shall designate an SCO who shall coordinate State and local disaster assistance efforts with those of the Federal Government.

####### Governor's Authorized Representative.

(d)In the FEMA-State Agreement, the Governor shall designate the GAR, who shall administer Federal disaster assistance programs on behalf of the State and local governments and other grant or loan recipients. The GAR is responsible for the State compliance with the FEMA-State Agreement.

###### § 206.42 Responsibilities of coordinating officers.

(a) Following a declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, the FCO shall:

(1) Make an initial appraisal of the types of assistance most urgently needed;

(2) In coordination with the SCO, establish field offices and Disaster Application Centers as necessary to coordinate and monitor assistance programs, disseminate information, accept applications, and counsel individuals, families and businesses concerning available assistance;

(3) Coordinate the administration of relief, including activities of State and local governments, activities of Federal agencies, and those of the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Mennonite Disaster Service, and other voluntary relief organizations which agree to operate under the FCO's advice and direction;

(4) Undertake appropriate action to make certain that all of the Federal agencies are carrying out their appropriate disaster assistance roles under their own legislative authorities and operational policies; and

(5) Take other action, consistent with the provisions of the Stafford Act, as necessary to assist citizens and public officials in promptly obtaining assistance to which they are entitled.

(b) The SCO coordinates State and local disaster assistance efforts with those of the Federal Government working closely with the FCO. The SCO is the principal point of contact regarding coordination of State and local disaster relief activities, and implementation of the State emergency plan. The functions, responsibilities, and authorities of the SCO are set forth in the State emergency plan. It is the responsibility of the SCO to ensure that all affected local jurisdictions are informed of the declaration, the types of assistance authorized, and the areas eligible to receive such assistance.

###### § 206.43 Emergency support teams.

The Federal Coordinating Officer may activate emergency support teams, composed of Federal program and support personnel, to be deployed into an area affected by a major disaster or emergency. These emergency support teams assist the FCO in carrying out his/her responsibilities under the Stafford Act and these regulations. Any Federal agency can be directed to detail personnel within the agency's administrative jurisdiction to temporary duty with the FCO. Each detail shall be without loss of seniority, pay, or other employee status.

###### § 206.44 FEMA-State Agreements.

####### General.

(a)Upon the declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, the Governor, acting for the State, and the FEMA Regional Administrator or his/her designee, acting for the Federal Government, shall execute a FEMA-State Agreement. The FEMA-State Agreement states the understandings, commitments, and conditions for assistance under which FEMA disaster assistance shall be provided. This Agreement imposes binding obligations on FEMA, States, their local governments, and private nonprofit organizations within the States in the form of conditions for assistance which are legally enforceable. No FEMA funding will be authorized or provided to any grantees or other recipients, nor will direct Federal assistance be authorized by mission assignment, until such time as this Agreement for the Presidential declaration has been signed, except where it is deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to begin the process of providing essential emergency services or housing assistance under the Individuals and Households Program.

####### Terms and conditions.

(b)This Agreement describes the incident and the incident period for which assistance will be made available, the type and extent of the Federal assistance to be made available, and contains the commitment of the State and local government(s) with respect to the amount of funds to be expended in alleviating damage and suffering caused by the major disaster or emergency. The Agreement also contains such other terms and conditions consistent with the declaration and the provisions of applicable laws, Executive Order and regulations.

####### Provisions for modification.

(c)In the event that the conditions stipulated in the original Agreement are changed or modified, such changes will be reflected in properly executed amendments to the Agreement, which may be signed by the GAR and the Regional Administrator or his/her designee for the specified major disaster or emergency. Amendments most often occur to close or amend the incident period, to add forms of assistance not originally authorized, or to designate additional areas eligible for assistance.

(d) In a modified declaration for a Federal emergency, a FEMA-State Agreement may or may not be required based on the type of assistance being provided.

###### § 206.45 Loans of non-Federal share.

####### Conditions for making loans.

(a)At the request of the Governor, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate together with the Chief Financial Officer may lend or advance to a State, either for its own use or for the use of public or private nonprofit applicants for disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, the portion of assistance for which the State or other eligible disaster assistance applicant is responsible under the cost-sharing provisions of the Stafford Act in any case in which:

(1) The State or other eligible disaster assistance applicant is unable to assume their financial responsibility under such cost sharing provisions:

(i) As a result of concurrent, multiple major disasters in a jurisdiction, or

(ii) After incurring extraordinary costs as a result of a particular disaster;

(2) The damages caused by such disasters or disaster are so overwhelming and severe that it is not possible for the State or other eligible disaster assistance applicant to immediately assume their financial responsibility under the Act; and

(3) The State and the other eligible disaster applicants are not delinquent in payment of any debts to FEMA incurred as a result of Presidentially declared major disasters or emergencies.

####### Repayment of loans.

(b)Any loan made to a State under paragraph (a) of this section must be repaid to the United States. The Governor must include a repayment schedule as part of the request for advance.

(1) The State shall repay the loan (the principal disbursed plus interest) in accordance with the repayment schedule approved by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate together with the Chief Financial Officer.

(2) If the State fails to make payments in accordance with the approved repayment schedule, FEMA will offset delinquent amounts against the current, prior, or any subsequent disasters, or monies due the State under other FEMA programs, in accordance with the established Claims Collection procedures.

####### Interest.

(c)Loans or advances under paragraph (a) of this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period of the loan or advance. Simple interest will be computed from the date of the disbursement of each drawdown of the loan/advance by the State based on 365 days/year.

###### § 206.46 Appeals.

####### Denial of declaration request.

(a)When a request for a major disaster declaration or for any emergency declaration is denied, the Governor may appeal the decision. An appeal must be made within 30 days after the date of the letter denying the request. This one-time request for reconsideration, along with appropriate additional information, is submitted to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator. The processing of this request is similar to the initial request.

####### Denial of types of assistance or areas.

(b)In those instances when the type of assistance or certain areas requested by the Governor are not designated or authorized, the Governor, or the GAR, may appeal the decision. An appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the date of the letter denying the request. This one-time request for reconsideration, along with justification and/or additional information, is sent to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directoratethrough the appropriate Regional Administrator.

####### Denial of advance of non-Federal share.

(c)In those instances where the Governor's request for an advance is denied, the Governor may appeal the decision. An appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the date of the letter denying the request. This one-time request for reconsideration, along with justification and/or additional information, is sent to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directoratethrough the appropriate Regional Administrator.

####### Extension of time to appeal.

(d)The 30-day period referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request for such an extension, citing reasons for the delay, is made during this 30-day period, and if the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate agrees that there is a legitimate basis for extension of the 30-day period. Only the Governor may request a time extension for appeals covered in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. The Governor, or the GAR if one has been named, may submit the time extension request for appeals covered in paragraph (b) of this section.

###### § 206.47 Cost-share adjustments.

(a) We pay seventy-five percent (75%) of the eligible cost of permanent restorative work under section 406 of the Stafford Act and for emergency work under section 403 and section 407 of the Stafford Act, unless the Federal share is increased under this section.

(b) We recommend an increase in the Federal cost share from seventy-five percent (75%) to not more than ninety percent (90%) of the eligible cost of permanent work under section 406 and of emergency work under section 403 and section 407 whenever a disaster is so extraordinary that actual Federal obligations under the Stafford Act, excluding FEMA administrative cost, meet or exceed a qualifying threshold of:

(1) Beginning in 1999 and effective for disasters declared on or after May 21, 1999, $75 per capita of State population;

(2) Effective for disasters declared after January 1, 2000, and through December 31, 2000, $85 per capita of State population;

(3) Effective for disasters declared after January 1, 2001, $100 per capita of State population; and,

(4) Effective for disasters declared after January 1, 2002 and for later years, $100 per capita of State population, adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published annually by the Department of Labor.

(c) When we determine whether to recommend a cost-share adjustment we consider the impact of major disaster declarations in the State during the preceding twelve-month period.

(d) If warranted by the needs of the disaster, we recommend up to one hundred percent (100%) Federal funding for emergency work under section 403 and section 407, including direct Federal assistance, for a limited period in the initial days of the disaster irrespective of the per capita impact.

###### § 206.48 Factors considered when evaluating a Governor's request for a major disaster declaration.

When we review a Governor's request for major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, these are the primary factors in making a recommendation to the President whether assistance is warranted. We consider other relevant information as well.

####### Public Assistance Program.

(a)We evaluate the following factors to evaluate the need for assistance under the Public Assistance Program.

####### Estimated cost of the assistance.

(1)We evaluate the estimated cost of Federal and nonfederal public assistance against the statewide population to give some measure of the per capita impact within the State. We use a figure of $1 per capita as an indicator that the disaster is of such size that it might warrant Federal assistance, and adjust this figure annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. We are establishing a minimum threshold of $1 million in public assistance damages per disaster in the belief that we can reasonably expect even the lowest population States to cover this level of public assistance damage.

####### Localized impacts.

(2)We evaluate the impact of the disaster at the county and local government level, as well as impacts at the American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal Government levels, because at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met. This is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per capita impacts might be extremely high. For example, we have at times seen localized damages in the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita though the statewide per capita impact was low.

####### Insurance coverage in force.

(3)We consider the amount of insurance coverage that is in force or should have been in force as required by law and regulation at the time of the disaster, and reduce the amount of anticipated assistance by that amount.

####### Hazard mitigation.

(4)To recognize and encourage mitigation, we consider the extent to which State and local government measures contributed to the reduction of disaster damages for the disaster under consideration. For example, if a State can demonstrate in its disaster request that a Statewide building code or other mitigation measures are likely to have reduced the damages from a particular disaster, we consider that in the evaluation of the request. This could be especially significant in those disasters where, because of mitigation, the estimated public assistance damages fell below the per capita indicator.

####### Recent multiple disasters.

(5)We look at the disaster history within the last twelve-month period to evaluate better the overall impact on the State or locality. We consider declarations under the Stafford Act as well as declarations by the Governor and the extent to which the State has spent its own funds.

####### Programs of other Federal assistance.

(6)We also consider programs of other Federal agencies because at times their programs of assistance might more appropriately meet the needs created by the disaster.

####### Factors for the Individual Assistance Program.

(b)The following factors are used to evaluate the need for supplemental Federal assistance to individuals under the Stafford Act, as Federal assistance may not supplant the combined capabilities of a State, Tribal, or local government. Federal Individual Assistance, if authorized, is intended to assist eligible individuals and families when State, Tribal, and local government resources and assistance programs are overwhelmed. State fiscal capacity (44 CFR 206.48(b)(1)(i)) and uninsured home and personal property losses (44 CFR 206.48(b)(2)) are the principal factors that FEMA will consider when evaluating the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program but FEMA will always consider all relevant information submitted as part of a declaration request. If the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program is not clear from the evaluation of the principal factors, FEMA will turn to the other factors to determine the level of need.

####### State fiscal capacity and resource availability.

(1)FEMA will evaluate the availability of State resources, and where appropriate, any extraordinary circumstances that contributed to the absence of sufficient resources.

####### Fiscal capacity (principal factor for individuals and households program).

(i)Fiscal capacity is a State's potential ability to raise revenue from its own sources to respond to and recover from a disaster. The following data points are indicators of fiscal capacity.

####### Total taxable resources (TTR) of the State.

(A)TTR is the U.S. Department of Treasury's annual estimate of the relative fiscal capacity of a State. A low TTR may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high TTR.

####### Gross domestic product (GDP) by State.

(B)GDP by State is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP by State may be used as an alternative or supplemental evaluation method to TTR.

####### Per capita personal income by local area.

(C)Per capita personal income by local area is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A low per capita personal income by local area may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high per capita personal income by local area.

####### Other factors.

(D)Other limits on a State's treasury or ability to collect funds may be considered.

####### Resource availability.

(ii)Federal disaster assistance under the Stafford Act is intended to be supplemental in nature, and is not a replacement for State emergency relief programs, services, and funds. FEMA evaluates the availability of resources from State, Tribal, and local governments as well as non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

####### State, tribal, and local government; non-governmental organizations (NGO); and Private Sector Activity.

(A)State, Tribal, and local government, Non-Governmental Organizations, and private sector resources may offset the need for or reveal an increased need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide information regarding the resources that have been and will be committed to meet the needs of disaster survivors such as housing programs, resources provided through financial and in-kind donations, and the availability of affordable (as determined by the U.S. Department of Urban and Housing Development's fair market rent standards) rental housing within a reasonable commuting distance of the impacted area.

####### Cumulative effect of recent disasters.

(B)The cumulative effect of recent disasters may affect the availability of State, Tribal, local government, NGO, and private sector disaster recovery resources. The State should provide information regarding the disaster history within the last 24-month period, particularly those occurring within the current fiscal cycle, including both Presidential (public and individual assistance) and gubernatorial disaster declarations.

####### Uninsured home and personal property losses (principal factor for individuals and households program).

(2)Uninsured home and personal property losses may suggest a need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide the following preliminary damage assessment data:

(i) The cause of damage.

(ii) The jurisdictions impacted and concentration of damage.

(iii) The number of homes impacted and degree of damage.

(iv) The estimated cost of assistance.

(v) The homeownership rate of impacted homes.

(vi) The percentage of affected households with sufficient insurance coverage appropriate to the peril.

(vii) Other relevant preliminary damage assessment data.

####### Disaster impacted population profile.

(3)The demographics of a disaster impacted population may identify additional needs that require a more robust community response and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. FEMA will consider demographics of the impacted communities for the following data points as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau or other Federal agencies:

(i) The percentage of the population for whom poverty status is determined.

(ii) The percentage of the population already receiving government assistance such as Supplemental Security Income and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.

(iii) The pre-disaster unemployment rate.

(iv) The percentage of the population that is 65 years old and older.

(v) The percentage of the population 18 years old and younger.

(vi) The percentage of the population with a disability.

(vii) The percentage of the population who speak a language other than English and speak English less than "very well."

(viii) Any unique considerations regarding American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal populations raised in the State's request for a major disaster declaration that may not be reflected in the data points referenced in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.

####### Impact to community infrastructure.

(4)The following impacts to a community's infrastructure may adversely affect a population's ability to safely and securely reside within the community.

####### Life saving and life sustaining services.

(i)The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for life-saving and life-sustaining services, necessitate a more robust response, and may delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on life saving and life sustaining services for a period of greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to police, fire/EMS, hospital/medical, sewage, and water treatment services.

####### Essential community services.

(ii)The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for essential community services and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on essential community services for a period greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to schools, social services programs and providers, child care, and eldercare.

####### Transportation infrastructure and utilities.

(iii)Transportation infrastructure or utility disruptions may render housing uninhabitable or inaccessible. Such conditions may also affect the delivery of life sustaining commodities, provision of emergency services, ability to shelter in place, and efforts to rebuild. The State may provide information regarding the impact on transportation infrastructure and utilities for a period of greater than 72 hours.

####### Casualties.

(5)The number of individuals who are missing, injured, or deceased due to a disaster may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal disaster assistance. The State may report the number of missing, injured, or deceased individuals.

####### Disaster related unemployment.

(6)The number of disaster survivors who lost work or became unemployed due to a disaster and who do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal assistance. This usually includes the self-employed, service industry workers, and seasonal workers such as those employed in tourism, fishing, or agriculture industries. The State may provide an estimate of the number of disaster survivors impacted under this paragraph as well as information regarding major employers affected.

###### §§ 206.49-206.60 [Reserved]

###### §§ 206.68-206.100 [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households

###### § 206.101 Temporary housing assistance for emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.

####### Purpose.

(a)This section prescribes the policy to be followed by the Federal Government or any other organization when implementing section 408 of the Stafford Act for Presidentially-declared emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002 (Note that the reference to section 408 of the Stafford Act refers to prior legislation amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000).

####### Program intent.

(b)Assistance under this program is made available to applicants who require temporary housing as a result of a major disaster or emergency that is declared by the President. Eligibility for assistance is based on need created by disaster-related unlivability of a primary residence or other disaster-related displacement, combined with a lack of adequate insurance coverage. Eligible applicants may be paid for authorized accommodations and/or repairs. In the interest of assisting the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time, applicants who are able to do so will be encouraged to make their own arrangements for temporary housing. Although numerous instances of minor damage may cause some inconvenience to the applicant, the determining eligibility factor must be the livability of the primary residence. FEMA has also determined that it is reasonable to expect applicants or their landlords to make some repairs of a minor nature. Temporary housing will normally consist of a check to cover housing-related costs wherever possible.

####### Definitions,Adequate alternate housing

(c)-(1)means housing that:

(i) Accommodates the needs of the occupants.

(ii) Is within reasonable commuting distance of work, school, or agricultural activities which provide over 25% of the household income.

(iii) Is within the financial ability of the occupant in the realization of a permanent housing plan.

####### Effective date of assistance

(2)means the date the eligible applicant received temporary housing assistance but, where applicable, only after appropriate insurance benefits are exhausted.

####### Essential living area

(3)means that area of the residence essential to normal living, i.e., kitchen, one bathroom, dining area, living room, entrances and exits, and essential sleeping areas. It does not include family rooms, guest rooms, garages, or other nonessential areas, unless hazards exist in these areas which impact the safety of the essential living area.

####### Fair market rent

(4)means a reasonable amount to pay in the local area for the size and type of accommodations which meets the applicant's needs.

####### Financial ability

(5)is the determination of the occupant's ability to pay housing costs. The determination is based upon the amount paid for housing before the disaster, provided the household income has not changed subsequent to or as a result of the disaster or 25 percent of gross post disaster income if the household income changed as a result of the disaster. When computing financial ability, extreme or unusual financial circumstances may be considered by the Regional Administrator.

####### Household

(6)means all residents of the predisaster residence who request temporary housing assistance, plus any additions during the temporary housing period, such as infants, spouses, or part-time residents who were not present at the time of the disaster but who are expected to return during the temporary housing period.

####### Housing costs

(7)means shelter rent and mortgage payments including principal, interest, real estate taxes, real property insurance, and utility costs, where appropriate.

####### Occupant

(8)means an eligible applicant residing in temporary housing provided under this section.

####### Owner-occupied

(9)means that the residence is occupied by: the legal owner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence and pays no rent but is responsible for the payment of taxes, or maintenance of the residence; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights with formal title vested in another.

####### Primary residence

(10)means the dwelling where the applicant normally lives during the major portion of the calendar year, a dwelling which is required because of proximity to employment, or to agricultural activities as referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

####### Duplication of benefits,Requirement to avoid duplication.

(d)-(1)Temporary housing assistance shall not be provided to an applicant if such assistance has been provided by any other source. If any State or local government or voluntary agency has provided temporary housing, the assistance under this section begins at the expiration of such assistance, and may continue for a period not to exceed l8 months from the date of declaration, provided the criteria for continued assistance in paragraph (k)(3) of this section are met. If it is determined that temporary housing assistance will be provided under this section, notification shall be given those agencies which have the potential for duplicating such assistance. In the instance of insured applicants, temporary housing assistance shall be provided only when:

(i) Payment of the applicable benefits has been significantly delayed;

(ii) Applicable benefits have been exhausted;

(iii) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the temporary housing need; or

(iv) Housing is not available on the private market.

####### Recovery of funds.

(2)Prior to provision of assistance, the applicant must agree to repay to FEMA from insurance proceeds or recoveries from any other source an amount equivalent to the value of the temporary housing assistance provided. In no event shall the amount repaid to FEMA exceed the amount recovered by the applicant. All claims shall be collected in accordance with agency procedures for debt collection.

####### Applications,Application period.

(e)-(1)The standard FEMA application period is the 60 days following the date the President declares an incident a major disaster or an emergency. The Regional Administrator may, however, extend the application period, when we anticipate that we need more time to collect applications from the affected population or to establish the same application deadline for contiguous Counties or States. After the application period has ended, FEMA will accept and process applications for an additional 60 days only from persons who can provide an acceptable explanation (and documentation to substantiate their explanation) for why they were not able to contact FEMA before the application period ended.

####### Household composition.

(2)Members of a household shall be included on a single application and be provided one temporary housing residence unless it is determined by the Regional Administrator that the size of the household requires that more than one residence be provided.

####### General eligibility guidelines.

(f)Temporary housing assistance may be made available to those applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency declared by the President, are qualified for such assistance.

####### Conditions of eligibility.,both

(1)Temporary housing assistance may be provided only whenof the following conditions are met:

(i) The applicant's primary residence has been made unlivable or the applicant has been displaced as the result of a major disaster or emergency because:

(A) The residence has been destroyed, essential utility service has been interrupted, or the essential living area has been damaged as a result of the disaster to such an extent as to constitute a serious health or safety hazard which did not exist prior to the disaster. The Regional Administrator shall prepare additional guidelines when necessary to respond to a particular disaster;

(B) The residence has been made inaccessible as a result of the incident to the extent that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to gain entry due to the disruption or destruction of transportation routes, other impediments to access, or restrictions placed on movement by a responsible official due to continued health and safety problems;

(C) The owner of the applicant's residence requires the residence to meet their personal needs because the owner's predisaster residence was made unlivable as a result of the disaster;

(D) Financial hardship resulting from the disaster has led to eviction or dispossession; or

(E) Other circumstances resulting from the disaster, as determined by the Regional Administrator, prevent the applicant from occupying their predisaster primary residence.

(ii) Insured applicants have made every reasonable effort to secure insurance benefits, and the insured has agreed to repay FEMA from whatever insurance proceeds are later received, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

####### Conditions of ineligibility.

(2)Except as provided for in section 408(b), Temporary Housing Assistance shall not be provided:

(i) To an applicant who is displaced from other than their primary residence; or

(ii) When the residence in question is livable, i.e., only minor damage exists and it can reasonably be expected to be repaired by the applicant/owner or the landlord; or

(iii) When the applicant owns a secondary or vacation residence, or unoccupied rental property which meets their temporary housing needs; or

(iv) To an applicant who has adequate rent-free housing accommodations; or

(v) To an applicant who has adequate insurance coverage and there is no indication that benefits will be delayed; or

(vi) When a late application is not approved for processing by the Regional Administrator; or

(vii) To an applicant who evacuated the residence in response to official warnings solely as a precautionary measure, and who is able to return to the residence immediately after the incident (i.e., the applicant is not otherwise eligible for temporary housing assistance).

####### Forms of Temporary Housing Assistance.

(g)All proceeds received or receivable by the applicant under § 206.101 shall be exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release, or waiver. No rights under this provision are assignable or transferable.

(1) Temporary Housing Assistance is normally provided in the form of a check to cover the cost of rent or essential home repairs. The exceptions to this are when existing rental resources are not available and repairs to the home will not make it livable in a reasonable period of time, or when the eligible applicant is unable to physically leave the home due to the need to tend crops or livestock.

####### Government-owned, private, and commercial properties.

(i)When an eligible applicant is unable to obtain an available temporary housing unit, FEMA may enter into a leasing agreement for the eligible applicant. Rent payments shall be in accordance with the fair market rent (FMR) rates established for each operation for the type and size residence.

####### Transient accommodations.

(ii)Immediately following a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency, disaster victims are expected to stay with family or friends without FEMA assistance, or to make use of mass shelters to the fullest extent possible for short-term housing. Transient accommodations may be provided when individual circumstances warrant such assistance for only a short period of time or pending provision of other temporary housing resources. Transient accommodations may be provided for up to 30 days unless this period is extended by the Regional Administrator. Authorized expenditures for transient accommodations shall be restricted to the rental cost including utilities except for those which are separately metered. Payment for food, telephone, or other similar services is not authorized under this section.

(2) Mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units. Government-owned or privately owned mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units may be placed on commercial, private, or group sites. The placement must comply with applicable State and local codes and ordinances as well as FEMA'S regulations at 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and the regulations at 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations.

(i) A commercial site is a site customarily leased for a fee because it is fully equipped to accommodate a housing unit. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that leasing commercial sites at Federal expense is in the public interest. When the Regional Administrator determines that upgrading of commercial sites or installation of utilities on such sites will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, they may authorize such action at Federal expense.

(ii) A private site is a site provided or obtained by the applicant at no cost to the Federal Government. Also in accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that the cost of installation or repairs of essential utilities on private sites is authorized at Federal expense when such actions will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources.

(iii) A group site is a site which accommodates two or more units. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(A), locations for group sites shall be provided by State or local government complete with utilities. However, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize development of group sites, including installation of essential utilities, by the Federal Government, based on a recommendation from the Regional Administrator; provided, however, that the Federal expense is limited to 75 percent of the cost of construction and development (including installation of utilities). In accordance with section 408(a)(4) of the Stafford Act, the State or local government shall pay any cost which is not paid for from the Federal share, including long-term site maintenance such as snow removal, street repairs and other services of a governmental nature.

####### Temporary mortgage and rental payments.

(3)Assistance in the form of mortgage or rental payments may be paid to or be provided on behalf of eligible applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency, have received written notice of dispossession or eviction from their primary residence by foreclosure of any mortgage or lien, cancellation of any contract of sale, or termination of any lease entered into prior to the disaster. Written notice, for the purpose of this paragraph, means a communication in writing by a landlord, mortgage holder, or other party authorized under State law to file such notice. The purpose of such notice is to notify a person of impending termination of a lease, foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, or cancellation of any contract of sale, which would result in the person's dispossession or eviction. Applications for this type of assistance may be filed for up to 6 months following the date of declaration. This assistance may be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months or for the duration of the period of financial hardship, as determined by the Regional Administrator, whichever is less. The location of the residence of an applicant for assistance under this section shall not be a consideration of eligibility.

####### Home repairs.

(4)Repairs may be authorized to quickly repair or restore to a livable condition that portion of or areas affecting the essential living area of, or private access to, an owner-occupied primary residence which was damaged as a result of the disaster. Installation of utilities or conveniences not available in the residence prior to the disaster shall not be provided. However, repairs which are authorized shall conform to applicable local and/or State building codes; upgrading of existing damaged utilities may be authorized when required by these codes.

####### Options for repairs.

(i)Eligible applicants approved for repairs may be assisted through one or a combination of the following methods:

####### Cash payment.

(A)Payment shall be limited to the reasonable costs for the repairs and replacements in the locality, as determined by the Regional Administrator. This will be the method normally used, unless unusual circumstances warrant the methods listed under paragraph (g)(4), (i) (B) or (C) of this section.

(B) Provision of materials and replacement items.

(C) Government awarded repair contracts when authorized by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

####### Feasibility.

(ii)Repairs may be provided to those eligible applicants:

(A) Who are owner-occupants of the residence to be made livable;

(B) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living area within 30 days following the feasibility determination. The Regional Administrator may extend this period for extenuating circumstances by determining that this type of assistance is still more cost effective, timely and otherwise suitable than other forms for temporary housing; and

(C) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living area, the cost of which do not exceed the dollar limitations established by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive the dollar limitations when repairs are more cost effective and appropriate than other forms of housing assistance or when extenuating circumstances warrant.

####### Scope of work.

(iii)The type of repair or replacement authorized may vary depending upon the nature of the disaster. Items will be repaired where feasible or replaced only when necessary to insure the safety or health of the occupant. Replacement items shall be of average quality, size, and capacity taking into consideration the needs of the occupant. Repairs shall be disaster related and shall be limited to:

(A) Repairs to the plumbing system, including repairs to or replacement of fixtures, providing service to the kitchen and one bathroom;

(B) Repairs to the electrical system providing service to essential living areas, including repairs to or replacement of essential fixtures;

(C) Repairs to the heating unit, including repairs to duct work, vents, and integral fuel and electrical systems. If repair or replacement through other forms of assistance cannot be accomplished before the start of the season requiring heat, home repairs may be authorized by the Regional Administrator when an inspection shows that the unit has been damaged beyond repair, or when the availability of necessary parts or components makes repair impossible;

(D) Repairs to or replacement of essential components of the fuel system to provide for cooking;

(E) Pumping and cleaning of the septic system, repairs to or replacement of the tank, drainfield, or repairs to sewer lines;

(F) Flushing and/or purifying the water well, and repairs to or replacement of the pump, controls, tank, and pipes;

(J) Blocking, leveling, and anchoring of a mobile home; and reconnecting and/or resetting mobile home sewer, water, electrical and fuel lines, and tanks;

(K) Emergency repairs to private access routes, limited to those repairs that meet the minimum safety standards and using the most economical materials available. Such repairs are provided on a one-time basis when no alternative access facilities are immediately available and when the repairs are more cost effective, timely or otherwise suitable than other forms of temporary housing.

(L) Repairs to the foundation piers, walls or footings when the damages affect the structural integrity of the essential living area;

(M) Repairs to the stove and refrigerator, when feasible; and

(N) Elimination of other health and safety hazards or performance of essential repairs which are authorized by the Regional Administrator as not available through emergency services provided by voluntary or community agencies, and cannot reasonably be expected to be completed on a timely basis by the occupant without FEMA assistance.

(iv) Requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act. FEMA has determined that flood insurance purchase requirements need not be imposed as a condition of receiving assistance under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Repair recipients will normally receive assistance for further repairs from other programs which will impose the purchase and maintenance requirements. Home repairs may not be provided in Zones A or V of a sanctioned or suspended community except for items that are not covered by flood insurance.

####### Appropriate form of temporary housing.

(h)The form of temporary housing provided should not exceed occupants' minimum requirements, taking into consideration items such as timely availability, cost effectiveness, permanent housing plans, special needs (handicaps, the location of crops and livestock, etc.) of the occupants, and the requirements of FEMA'S floodplain management regulations at 44 CFR part 9. An eligible applicant shall receive one form of temporary housing, except for transient accommodations or when provision of an additional form is in the best interest of the Government. An eligible applicant is expected to accept the first offer of temporary housing; unwarranted refusal shall result in forfeiture of temporary housing assistance. Existing rental resources and home repairs shall be utilized to the fullest extent practicable prior to provision of government-owned mobile homes.

####### Utility costs and security deposits.

(i)All utility costs shall be the responsibility of the occupant except where utility services are not metered separately and are therefore a part of the rental charge. Utility use charges and deposits shall always be the occupants responsibility. When authorized by the Regional Administrator, the Federal Government may pay security deposits; however, the owner or occupant shall reimburse the full amount of the security deposit to the Federal Government before or at the time that the temporary housing assistance is terminated.

####### Furniture.

(j)An allowance for essential furniture may be provided to occupants when such assistance is required to occupy the primary or temporary housing residence. However, loss of furniture does not in and of itself constitute eligibility for temporary housing assistance. Luxury items shall not be provided.

####### Duration of assistance,Commencement.

(k)-(1)Temporary housing assistance may be provided as of the date of the incident of the major disaster or emergency as specified in thenotice and may continue for 18 months from the date of declaration. An effective date of assistance shall be established for each applicant.

All other occupants of temporary housing shall be certified eligible for continued assistance in increments not to exceed 3 months. Recertification of eligibility for continued assistance shall be in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section, taking into consideration the occupant's permanent housing plan. A realistic permanent housing plan shall be established for each occupant requesting additional assistance no later than at the time of the first recertification.

The Regional Administrator shall reconsider the original decision within 15 calendar days after its receipt. The appellant shall be given a written notice of the disposition of the dispute. The decision of the Regional Administrator is final.

###### §§ 206.102-206.109 [Reserved]

###### § 206.110 Federal assistance to individuals and households.

####### Purpose.

(a)This section implements the policy and procedures set forth in section 408 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174, as amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This program provides financial assistance and, if necessary, direct assistance to eligible individuals and households who, as a direct result of a major disaster or emergency, have uninsured or under-insured, necessary expenses and serious needs and are unable to meet such expenses or needs through other means.

####### Maximum amount of assistance.

(b)No individual or household will receive financial assistance greater than $25,000 under this subpart with respect to a single major disaster or emergency. FEMA will adjust the $25,000 limit annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers that the Department of Labor publishes.

####### Multiple types of assistance.

(c)One or more types of housing assistance may be made available under this section to meet the needs of individuals and households in the particular disaster situation. FEMA shall determine the appropriate types of housing assistance to be provided under this section based on considerations of cost effectiveness, convenience to the individuals and households and the suitability and availability of the types of assistance. An applicant is expected to accept the first offer of housing assistance; unwarranted refusal of assistance may result in the forfeiture of future housing assistance. Temporary housing and repair assistance shall be utilized to the fullest extent practicable before other types of housing assistance.

####### Date of eligibility.

(d)Eligibility for Federal assistance under this subpart will begin on the date of the incident that results in a presidential declaration that a major disaster or emergency exists, except that reasonable lodging expenses that are incurred in anticipation of and immediately preceding such event may be eligible for Federal assistance under this chapter.

####### Period of assistance.

(e)FEMA may provide assistance under this subpart for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of declaration. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may extend this period if he/she determines that due to extraordinary circumstances an extension would be in the public interest.

####### Assistance not counted as income.

(f)Assistance under this subpart is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare, income assistance or income-tested benefit programs that the Federal Government funds.

####### Exemption from garnishment.

(g)All assistance provided under this subpart is exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release or waiver. Recipients of rights under this provision may not reassign or transfer the rights. These exemptions do not apply to FEMA recovering assistance fraudulently obtained or misapplied.

####### Duplication of benefits.

(h)In accordance with the requirements of section 312 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, FEMA will not provide assistance under this subpart when any other source has already provided such assistance or when such assistance is available from any other source. In the instance of insured applicants, we will provide assistance under this subpart only when:

(1) Payment of the applicable benefits are significantly delayed;

(2) Applicable benefits are exhausted;

(3) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the housing or other needs; or

(4) Housing is not available on the private market.

####### Cost sharing.

(i)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the Federal share of eligible costs paid under this subpart shall be 100 percent.

(2) Federal and State cost shares for "Other Needs" assistance under subsections 408 (e) and (f) of the Stafford Act will be as follows;

(i) The Federal share shall be 75 percent; and

####### i.e.

(ii) The non-federal share shall be paid from funds made available by the State. If the State does not provide the non-Federal share to FEMA before FEMA begins to provide assistance to individuals and households under subsection 408(e) of the Stafford Act, FEMA will still process applications. The State will then be obliged to reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal cost share of such assistance on a monthly basis. If the State does not provide such reimbursement on a monthly basis, then FEMA will issue a Bill for Collection to the State on a monthly basis for the duration of the program. FEMA will charge interest, penalties, and administrative fees on delinquent Bills for Collection in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act. Cost shared funds, interest, penalties and fees owed to FEMA through delinquent Bills for Collections may be offset from other FEMA disaster assistance programs (Public Assistance) from which the State is receiving, or future grant awards from FEMA or other Federal Agencies. Debt Collection procedures will be followed as outlined in 44 CFR part 11.

####### Application of the Privacy Act.

(j)(1) All provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, apply to this subpart. FEMA may not disclose an applicant's record except:

(i) In response to a release signed by the applicant that specifies the purpose for the release, to whom the release is to be made, and that the applicant authorizes the release;

(ii) In accordance with one of the published routine uses in our system of records; or

(iii) As provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.

(2) Under section 408(f)(2) of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174(f)(2), FEMA must share applicant information with States in order for the States to make available any additional State and local disaster assistance to individuals and households.

(i) States receiving applicant information under this paragraph must protect such information in the same manner that the Privacy Act requires FEMA to protect it.

(ii) States receiving such applicant information shall not further disclose the information to other entities, and shall not use it for purposes other than providing additional State or local disaster assistance to individuals and households.

###### § 206.119 Financial assistance to address other needs.

####### Purpose.

(a)FEMA and the State may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who have other disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs. To qualify for assistance under this section, an applicant must also:

(1) Apply to the United States Small Business Administration's (SBA) Disaster Home Loan Program for all available assistance under that program; and

(2) Be declined for SBA Disaster Home Loan Program assistance; or

(3) Demonstrate that the SBA assistance received does not satisfy their total necessary expenses or serious needs arising out of the major disaster.

####### Types of assistance.

(b)(1) Medical, dental, and funeral expenses. FEMA may provide financial assistance for medical, dental and funeral items or services to meet the disaster-related necessary expenses and serious needs of individuals and households.

(2) Personal property, transportation, and other expenses.

(i) FEMA may provide financial assistance for personal property and transportation items or services to meet the disaster-related necessary expenses and serious needs of individuals and households.

(ii) FEMA may provide financial assistance for other items or services that are not included in the specified categories for other assistance but which FEMA approves, in coordination with the State, as eligible to meet unique disaster-related necessary expenses and serious needs of individuals and households.

####### Eligible costs,Personal property.

(c)-(1)Necessary expenses and serious needs for repair or replacement of personal property are generally limited to the following:

(i) Clothing;

(ii) Household items, furnishings or appliances;

(iii) Tools, specialized or protective clothing, and equipment required by an employer as a condition of employment;

(iv) Computers, uniforms, schoolbooks and supplies required for educational purposes; and

(v) Cleaning or sanitizing any eligible personal property item.

####### Medical expenses.

(3)Medical expenses are generally limited to the following:

(i) Medical costs;

(iii) Repair or replacement of medical equipment.

####### Funeral expenses.

(4)Funeral expenses are generally limited to the following

(i) Funeral services;

(ii) Burial or cremation; and

(iii) Other related funeral expenses.

####### Moving and storage expenses.

(5)Necessary expenses and serious needs related to moving and storing personal property to avoid additional disaster damage generally include storage of personal property while disaster-related repairs are being made to the primary residence, and return of the personal property to the individual or household's primary residence.

####### Other.

(6)Other disaster-related expenses not addressed in this section may include:

(i) The purchase of a Group Flood Insurance Policy as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(ii) Other miscellaneous items or services that FEMA, in consultation with the State, determines are necessary expenses and serious needs.

####### Group Flood Insurance purchase.

(d)Individuals identified by FEMA as eligible for "Other Needs" assistance under section 408 of the Stafford Act as a result of flood damage caused by a Presidentially-declared major disaster and who reside in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) may be included in a Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) established under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations at 44 CFR 61.17.

(1) The premium for the GFIP is a necessary expense within the meaning of this section. FEMA or the State shall withhold this portion of the Other Needs award and provide it to the NFIP on behalf of individuals and households who are eligible for coverage. The coverage shall be equivalent to the maximum assistance amount established under section 408 of the Stafford Act.

(2) FEMA or the State IHP staff shall provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received an "Other Needs" award and are to be insured through the GFIP. Records of "Other Needs" applicants to be insured shall be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each applicant for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each applicant. Flood insurance coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State or FEMA, and such coverage terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, which is 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.

(3) Insured applicants would not be covered if they are determined to be ineligible for coverage based on a number of exclusions established by the NFIP. Therefore, once applicants/policyholders receive the Certificate of Flood Insurance that contains a list of the policy exclusions, they should review that list to see if they are ineligible for coverage. Those applicants who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the applicants find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the data-tracking system.

###### §§ 206.121-206.130 [Reserved]

##### Subpart E - Individual and Family Grant Programs

###### § 206.131 Individual and Family Grant Program for major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002.

####### General.

(a)The Governor may request that a Federal grant be made to a State for the purpose of such State making grants to individuals or families who, as a result of a major disaster, are unable to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs for Presidentially-declared major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002 (Note that the reference to section 411 of the Stafford Act refers to prior legislation amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000). The total Federal grant under this section will be equal to 75 percent of the actual cost of meeting necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals and families, plus State administrative expenses not to exceed 5 percent of the Federal grant (see paragraph (g) of this section). The total Federal grant is made only on condition that the remaining 25 percent of the actual cost of meeting individuals' or families' necessary expenses or serious needs is paid from funds made available by the State. With respect to any one major disaster, an individual or family may not receive a grant or grants under this section totaling more than $10,000 including both the Federal and State shares. The $10,000 limit will be adjusted annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. IFG assistance for damages or losses to real or personal property, or both, will be provided to individuals or families with those IFG-eligible losses totaling $201 or more; those individuals with damages or losses of $200 or less to real or personal property, or both, are ineligible. The Governor or his/her designee is responsible for the administration of the grant program. The provisions of this regulation are in accordance with 44 CFR Part 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.

####### Purpose.

(b)The grant program is intended to provide funds to individuals or families to permit them to meet those disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs for which assistance from other means is either unavailable or inadequate. Meeting those expenses and needs as expeditiously as possible will require States to make an early commitment of personnel and resources. States may make grants in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application to the IFG program, and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the State. The grant program is not intended to indemnify disaster losses or to permit purchase of items or services which may generally be characterized as nonessential, luxury, or decorative. Assistance under this program is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare or other income-tested programs supported by the Federal Government, in that IFG assistance is intended to address only disaster-related needs.

####### Definitions used in this section.,Necessary expense

(c)(1)means the cost of a serious need.

####### Serious need

(2)means the requirement for an item or service essential to an individual or family to prevent, mitigate, or overcome a disaster-related hardship, injury, or adverse condition.

####### Individual

(4)means anyone who is not a member of a family as described above.

####### Dependent

(5)means someone who is normally claimed as such on the Federal tax return of another, according to the Internal Revenue Code. It may also mean the minor children of a couple not living together where the children live in the affected residence with the parent who does not actually claim them on the tax return.

####### Expendable items

(6)means consumables, as follows: linens, clothes, and basic kitchenware (pots, pans, utensils, dinnerware, flatware, small kitchen appliances).

####### Assistance from other means

(7)means assistance including monetary or in-kind contributions, from other governmental programs, insurance, voluntary or charitable organizations, or from any sources other than those of the individual or family. It does not include expendable items.

####### Owner-occupied

(8)means that the residence is occupied by: The legal owner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence but is responsible for payment of taxes, maintenance of the residence, and pays no rent; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights in the residence with formal title vested in another. In States where documentation proving ownership is not recorded or does not exist, the State is required to include in its administrative plan a State Attorney General approved set of conditions describing adequate proof of ownership.

####### Flowage easement

(9)means an area where the landowner has given the right to overflow, flood, or submerge the land to the government or other entity for a public purpose.

####### National eligibility criteria.

(d)In administering the IFG program, a State shall determine the eligibility of an individual or family in accordance with the following criteria;

####### General.

(1)(i) To qualify for a grant under this section, an individual or family representative must:

(A) Make application to all applicable available governmental disaster assistance programs for assistance to meet a necessary expense or serious need, and be determined not qualified for such assistance, or demonstrate that the assistance received does not satisfy the total necessary expense or serious need;

(B) Not have previously received or refused assistance from other means for the specific necessary expense or serious need, or portion thereof, for which application is made; and

(C) Certify to refund to the State that part of the grant for which assistance from other means is received, or which is not spent as identified in the grant award document.

(ii) Individuals and families who incur a necessary expense or serious need in the major disaster area may be eligible for assistance under this section without regard to their alienage, their residency in the major disaster area, or their residency within the State in which the major disaster has been declared except that for assistance in the "housing" category, ownership and residency in the declared disaster area are required (see paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section).

(iii) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended, imposes certain restriction on approval of Federal financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes. This paragraph states those requirements for the IFG program.

####### financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes

(A) For the purpose of this paragraph,means a grant to an individual or family to repair, replace, or rebuild the insurable portions of a home, and/or to purchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elements of a home and contents are insurable, see 44 CFR part 61, Insurance Coverage and Rates.

(B) A State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes where the structure to which the grant assistance relates is located in a designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by the Assistant Administrator for Mitigation for at least 1 year as floodprone, unless the community in which the structure is located is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). However, if a community qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the 6-month period following the major disaster declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) may request a time extension (see paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section) from the Regional Administrator for the purpose of accepting and processing grant applications in that community. The Regional Administrator or Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, as appropriate, may approve the State's request if those applicable governmental disaster assistance programs which were available during the original application period are available to the grant applicants during the extended application period.

####### 1

(C)() The State may not make a grant for acquisition or construction purposes in a designated special flood hazard area in which the sale of flood insurance is available under the NFIP unless the individual or family obtains adequate flood insurance and maintains such insurance for as long as they live at that property address. The coverage shall equal the maximum grant amount established under § 411(f) of the Stafford Act. If the grantee is a homeowner, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the residence at the flood-damaged property address for as long as the structure exists if the grantee, or any subsequent owner of that real estate, ever wishes to be assisted by the Federal government with any subsequent flood damages or losses to real or personal property, or both. If the grantee is a renter, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the contents for as long as the renter resides at the flood-damaged property address. The restriction is lifted once the renter moves from the rental unit.

####### 2

() Individuals named by a State as eligible recipients under § 411 of the Stafford Act for an IFG program award for flood damage as a result of a Presidential major disaster declaration will be included in a Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) established under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations, at 44 CFR 61.17.

####### i

() The premium for the GFIP is a necessary expense within the meaning of this section. The State shall withhold this portion of the IFG award and provide it to the NFIP on behalf of individuals and families who are eligible for coverage. The coverage shall be equivalent to the maximum grant amount established under § 411(f) of the Stafford Act.

####### ii

() The State IFG program staff shall provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received an IFG award and are, therefore, to be insured. Records of IFG grantees to be insured shall be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each grantee for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each grantee. Flood insurance coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State, and terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, i.e., 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.

####### iii)

(Insured grantees would not be covered if they are determined to be ineligible for coverage based on a number of exclusions established by the NFIP. Therefore, once grantees/policyholders receive the Certificate of Flood Insurance that contains a list of the policy exclusions, they should review that list to see if they are ineligible for coverage. Those grantees who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the grantees find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the NFIP data-tracking system. (If the grantee wishes to refer to or review a Standard Flood Insurance Policy, it will be made available by the NFIP upon request.)

(D) A State may not make a grant to any individual or family who received Federal disaster assistance for flood damage occurring after September 23, 1994, if that property has already received Federal flood-disaster assistance in a disaster declared after September 23, 1994, a flood insurance purchase and maintenance requirement was levied as a condition or result of receiving that Federal disaster assistance, and flood insurance was, in fact, not maintained in an amount at least equal to the maximum IFG grant amount. However, if that property was determined to be ineligible for NFIP flood insurance coverage and is in a special flood hazard area located in a community participating in the NFIP, then the State may continue to make grants to those individuals or families that receive additional damage in all subsequent Presidentially declared major disasters involving floods.

(iv) In order to comply with the President's Executive Orders on Floodplain Management (E.O. 11988) and Protection of Wetlands (E.O. 11990), the State must implement the IFG program in accordance with FEMA regulations 44 CFR part 9. That part specifies which IFG program actions require a floodplain management decisionmaking process before a grant may be made, and also specifies the steps to follow in the decisionmaking process. Should the State determine that an individual or family is otherwise eligible for grant assistance, the State shall accomplish the necessary steps in accordance with that section, and request the Regional Administrator to make a final floodplain management determination.

####### Eligible categories.

(2)Assistance under this section shall be made available to meet necessary expenses or serious needs by providing essential items or services in the following categories:

(i) Housing. With respect to primary residences (including mobile homes) which are owner-occupied at the time of the disaster, grants may be authorized to:

(A) Repair, replace, or rebuild;

(B) Provide access. When an access serves more than one individual or family, an owner-occupant whose primary residence is served by the access may be eligible for a proportionate share of the cost of jointly repairing or providing such access. The owner-occupant may combine his/her grant funds with funds made available by the other individuals or families if a joint use agreement is executed (with no cost or charge involved) or if joint ownership of the access is agreed to;

(C) Clean or make sanitary;

(D) Remove debris from such residences. Debris removal is limited to the minimum required to remove health or safety hazards from, or protect against additional damage to the residence;

(E) Provide or take minimum protective measures required to protect such residences against the immediate threat of damage, which means that the disaster damage is causing a potential safety hazard and, if not repaired, will cause actual safety hazards from common weather or environmental events (example: additional rain, flooding, erosion, wind); and

(F) Minimization measures required by owner-occupants to comply with the provision of 44 CFR part 9 (Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands), to enable them to receive assistance from other means, and/or to enable them to comply with a community's floodplain management regulations.

(ii) Personal property. Proof of ownership of personal property is not required. This category includes:

(A) Clothing;

(B) Household items, furnishings, or appliances. If a predisaster renter receives a grant for household items, furnishings, or appliances and these items are an integral part of mobile home or other furnished unit, the predisaster renter may apply the funds awarded for these specific items toward the purchase of the furnished unit, and toward mobile home site development, towing, set-up, connecting and/or reconnecting;

(C) Tools, specialized or protective clothing, and equipment which are required by an employer as a condition of employment;

(D) Repairing, cleaning or sanitizing any eligible personal property item; and

(v) Funeral expenses. Grants may include funeral and burial (and/or cremation) and related expenses.

(vi) Cost of the first year's flood insurance premium to meet the requirement of this section.

(vii) Costs for estimates required for eligibility determinations under the IFG program. Housing and personal property estimates will be provided by the government. However, an applicant may appeal to the State if he/she feels the government estimate is inaccurate. The cost of an applicant-obtained estimate to support the appeal is not an eligible cost.

(viii) Other. A State may determine that other necessary expenses and serious needs are eligible for grant assistance. If such a determination is made, the State must summarize the facts of the case and thoroughly document its findings of eligibility. Should the State require technical assistance in making a determination of eligibility, it may provide a factual summary to the Regional Administrator and request guidance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate also may determine that other necessary expenses and serious needs are eligible for grant assistance. Following such a determination, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall advise the State, through the Regional Administrator, and provide the necessary program guidance.

####### Ineligible categories.

(3)Assistance under this section shall not be made available for any item or service in the following categories:

(i) Business losses, including farm businesses and self-employment;

(iv) Real or personal property used exclusively for recreation; and

(v) Financial obligations incurred prior to the disaster.

####### Verification.

(4)The State will be provided most verification data on IFG applicants who were not required to first apply to the SBA. The FEMA Regional Administrator shall be responsible for performing most of the required verifications in the categories of housing (to include documentation of home ownership and primary residency); personal property; and transportation (to include notation of the plate or title number of the vehicle; the State may wish to follow up on this). Certain verifications may still be required to be performed by the State, such as on late applicants or reverifications, when FEMA or its contractors are no longer available, and on medical/dental, funeral and "other" categories. Eligibility determination functions shall be performed by the State. The SBA will provide copies of verification performed by SBA staff on housing and personal property (including vehicles) for those applicants who were first required to apply to SBA. This will enable the State to make an eligibility determination on those applicants. When an applicant disagrees with the grant award, he/she may appeal to the State. The cost of any estimate provided by the applicant in support of his/her appeal is not eligible under the program.

####### State administrative plan.

(e)(1) The State shall develop a plan for the administration of the IFG program that includes, as a minimum, the items listed below.

(i) Assignment of grant program responsibilities to State officials or agencies.

(B) Participating with FEMA in the registration and acceptance of applications, including late applications, up to the prescribed time limitations;

(C) Reviewing verification data provided by FEMA and performing verifications for medical, dental, funeral, and "other" expenses, and also for all grant categories in the instance of late applications and appeals. FEMA will perform any necessary reverifications while its contract personnel are in the disaster area, and the State will perform any others;

(D) Determining applicant eligibility and grant amounts, and notifying applicants of the State's decision;

(K) Recovering grant funds obtained fraudulently, expended for unauthorized items or services, expended for items for which assistance is received from other means, or authorized for acquisition or construction purposes where proof of purchase of flood insurance is not provided to the State. Except for those mentioned in the previous sentence, grants made properly by the State on the basis of federally sponsored verification information are not subject to recovery by the State, i.e., FEMA will not hold the State responsible for repaying to FEMA the Federal share of those grants. The State is responsible for its 25 percent share of those grants. As an attachment to its voucher, the State must identify each case where recovery actions have been taken or are to be taken, and the steps taken or to be taken to accomplish recovery;

(L) Conducting any State audits that might be performed in compliance with the Single Audit Act of 1984; and ensuring that appropriate corrective action is taken within 6 months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;

(v) Pertinent time limitations for accepting applications, grant award activities, and administrative activities, to comply with Federal time limitations.

(vi) Provisions for specifically identifying, in the accounts of the State, all Federal and State funds committed to each grant program; for repaying the loaned State share as of the date agreed upon in the FEMA-State Agreement; and for immediately returning, upon discovery, all Federal funds that are excess to program needs.

(vii) Provisions for safeguarding the privacy of applicants and the confidentiality of information, except that the information may be provided to agencies or organizations who require it to make eligibility decisions for assistance programs, or to prevent duplication of benefits, to State agencies responsible for audit or program review, and to FEMA or the Government Accountability Office for the purpose of making audits or conducting program reviews.

(viii) A section identifying the management and staffing functions in the IFG program, the sources of staff to fill these functions, and the management and oversight responsibilities of:

(A) The GAR;

(B) The department head responsible for the IFG program;

(C) The Grant Coordinating Officer, i.e., the State official assigned management responsibility for the IFG program; and

(D) The IFG program manager, where management responsibilities are assigned to such a person on a day-to-day basis.

(2) The Governor or his/her designee may request the Regional Administrator to provide technical assistance in the preparation of an administrative plan to implement this program.

(3) The Governor shall submit a revised State administrative plan each January to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator shall review and approve the plan annually.

(4) The State shall make its approved administrative plan part of the State emergency plan, as described in subpart A of these regulations.

####### State initiation of the IFG program.

(f)To make assistance under this section available to disaster victims, the Governor must, either in the request of the President for a major disaster declaration or by separate letter to the Regional Administrator, express his/her intention to implement the program. This expression of intent must include an estimate of the size and cost of the program. In addition, this expression of intent represents the Governor's agreement to the following:

(1) That the program is needed to satisfy necessary expenses and serious needs of disaster victims which cannot otherwise be met;

(2) That the State will pay its 25 percent share of all grants to individuals and families;

(3) That the State will return immediately upon discovery advanced Federal funds that exceed actual requirements;

(4) To implement an administrative plan as identified in paragraph (e) of this section;

(5) To implement the grant program throughout the area designated as eligible for assistance by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate; and

(6) To maintain close coordination with and provide reports to the Regional Administrator.

####### Funding.

(g)(1) The Regional Administrator may obligate the Federal share of the IFG program based upon the determination that:

(i) The Governor has indicated the intention to implement the program, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section;

(ii) The State's administrative plan meets the requirements of this section and current policy guidance; and

(iii) There is no excess advance of the Federal share due FEMA from a prior IFG program. The State may eliminate any such debt by paying it immediately, or by accepting an offset of the owed funds against other funds payable by FEMA to the State. When the excess Federal share has been repaid, the Regional Administrator may then obligate funds for the Federal share for the current disaster.

(2) The Regional Administrator may increase the State's letter of credit to meet the Federal share of program needs if the above conditions are met. The State may withdraw funds for the Federal share in the amount made available to it by the Regional Administrator. Advances to the State are governed by 44 CFR 13.21, Payment.

(3) The Regional Administrator may lend to the State its share in accordance with subpart A of these regulations.

(4) Payable costs are governed by 44 CFR 13.22, Allowable Costs, and the associated OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments. Also, the costs must be in accordance with the national eligibility criteria stated in paragraph (d) of this section, and the State's administrative plan, as stated in paragraph (e) of this section. The Federal contribution to this program shall be 75 percent of program costs and shall be made in accordance with 44 CFR 13.25, Matching or Cost-Sharing.

####### Final payment.

(h)Final payment to the State for the Federal share of the IFG program plus administrative costs, is governed by 44 CFR l3.21, Payment, and 44 CFR 13.50, Closeout. The voucher is Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement). A separate voucher for the State share will be prepared, to include all disaster programs for which the State is requesting a loan of the nonFederal share. The FEMA Regional Administrator will analyze the voucher and approve, disapprove, or suspend approval until deficiencies are corrected.

####### Audits.

(i)The State should perform the audits required by the Single Audit Act of 1984. Refer to 44 CFR part 13. All programs are subject to Federal audit.

####### Time limitations.

(j)(1) In the administration of the IFG program:

(i) The Governor shall indicate his/her intention to implement the IFG program no later than 7 days following the day on which the major disaster was declared and in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) of this section;

####### Exception:

(ii) Applications shall be accepted from individuals or families for a period of 60 days following the declaration, and for no longer than 30 days thereafter when the State determines that extenuating circumstances beyond the applicants' control (such as, but not limited to, hospitalization, illness, or inaccessibility to application centers) prevented them from applying in a timely manner.If applicants exercising their responsibility to first apply to the Small Business Administration do so after SBA's deadline, and SBA accepts their case for processing because of "substantial causes essentially beyond the control of the applicant," and provides a formal decline or insufficient loan based on lack of repayment ability, unsatisfactory credit, or unsatisfactory experience with prior loans (i.e., the reasons a loan denial client would normally be eligible for IFG assistance), then such an application referred to the State by the SBA is considered as meeting the IFG filing deadline. The State may then apply its own criteria in determining whether to process the case for grant assistance. The State automatically has an extension of time to complete the processing, eligibility, and disbursement functions. However, the State must still complete all administrative activity within the 270-day period described in this section.

(iii) The State shall complete all grant award activity, including eligibility determinations, disbursement, and disposition of State level appeals, within 180 days following the declaration date. The Regional Administrator shall suspend all grant awards disbursed after the specified completion date; and

(iv) The State shall complete all administrative activities and submit final reports and vouchers to the Regional Administrator within 90 days of the completion of all grant award activity.

(2) The GAR may submit a request with appropriate justification for the extension of any time limitation. The Regional Administrator may approve the request for a period not to exceed 90 days. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve any request for a further extension of the time limitations.

####### Appeals,Bills for collection (BFC's).

(k)-(1)The State may appeal the issuance of a BFC by the Regional Administrator. Such an appeal shall be made in writing within 60 days of the issuance of the bill. The appeal must include information justifying why the bill is incorrect. The Regional Administrator shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision. Interest on BFC's starts accruing on the date of issuance of the BFC, but is not charged if the State pays within 30 days of issuance. If the State is successful in its appeal, interest will not be charged; if unsuccessful, interest is due and payable, as above.

####### Other appeals.

(2)The State may appeal any other decision of the regional Administrator. Such appeals shall be made in writing within 60 days of the Regional Administrator's decision. The appeal must include information justifying a reversal of the decision. The Regional Administrator shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision.

####### Appeals to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(3)The State may further appeal the Regional Administrator's decisions to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. This appeal shall be made in writing within 60 days of the Regional Administrator's decision. The appeal must include information justifying a reversal of the decision. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall review the material submitted and notify the State, in writing, within 15 days of receipt of the appeal, of his/her decision.

####### Exemption from garnishment.

(l)All proceeds received or receivable under the IFG program shall be exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release, or waiver. No rights under this provision are assignable or transferable. The above exemptions will not apply to the requirement imposed by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(K) of this section.

####### Debt collection.

(m)If the State has been unable to recover funds as stated in paragraph (e)(1)(k) of this section, the Regional Administrator shall institute debt collection activities against the individual according to the procedures outlined in 44 CFR part 11, Claims, and 44 CFR 13.52, Collection of Amounts Due.

For the purpose of this section,means those disaster victims who have insufficient resources to secure adequate legal services, whether the insufficiency existed prior to or results from the major disaster. In cases where questions arise about the eligibility of an individual for legal services, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative shall make a determination.

(b) Disaster legal services shall be provided free to such individuals. Fee-generating cases shall not be accepted by lawyers operating under these regulations. For purposes of this section, a fee-generating case is one which would not ordinarily be rejected by local lawyers as a result of its lack of potential remunerative value. Where any question arises as to whether a case is fee-generating as defined in this section, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative, after any necessary consultation with local or State bar associations, shall make the determination. Any fee-generating cases shall be referred by the Regional Administrator or his/her representative to private lawyers, through existing lawyer referral services, or, where that is impractical or impossible, the Regional Administrator may provide a list of lawyers from which the disaster victim may choose. Lawyers who have rendered voluntary legal assistance under these regulations are not precluded from taking fee-generating cases referred to them in this manner while in their capacity as private lawyers.

(c) When the Regional Administrator determines after any necessary consultation with the State Coordinating Officer, that implementation of this section is necessary, provision of disaster legal services may be accomplished by:

(1) Use of volunteer lawyers under the terms of appropriate agreements;

(2) Use of Federal lawyers, provided that these lawyers do not represent an eligible disaster victim before a court or Federal agency in a matter directly involving the United States, and further provided that these lawyers do not act in a way which will violate the standards of conduct of their respective agencies or departments;

(3) Use of private lawyers who may be paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the Regional Administrator has determined that there is no other means of obtaining adequate legal assistance for qualified disaster victims; or

(4) Any other arrangement the Regional Administrator deems appropriate.

The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall coordinate with appropriate Federal agencies and the appropriate national, state and local bar associations, as necessary, in the implementation of the disaster legal services programs.

(d) In the event it is necessary for FEMA to pay lawyers for the provision of legal services under these regulations, the Regional Administrator, in consultation with State and local bar associations, shall determine the amount of reimbursement due to the lawyers who have provided disaster legal services at the request of the Regional Administrator. At the Regional Administrator's discretion, administrative costs of lawyers providing legal services requested by him or her may also be paid.

(e) Provision of disaster legal services is confined to the securing of benefits under the Act and claims arising out of a major disaster.

(f) Any disaster legal services shall be provided in accordance with subpart A of these regulations, Non-discrimination in disaster assistance.

###### §§ 206.172-206.180 [Reserved]

###### § 206.181 Use of gifts and bequests for disaster assistance purposes.

####### General.

(a)FEMA sets forth procedures for the use of funds made possible by a bequest of funds from the late Cora C. Brown of Kansas City, Missouri, who left a portion of her estate to the United States for helping victims of natural disasters and other disasters not caused by or attributable to war. FEMA intends to use the funds, and any others that may be bequeathed under this authority, in the manner and under the conditions described below.

####### Purposes for awarding funds.

(b)Money from the Cora Brown Fund may only be used to provided for disaster-related needs that have not been or will not be met by governmental agencies or any other organizations which have programs to address such needs; however, the fund is not intended to replace or supersede these programs. For example, if assistance is available from another source, including the Individual and Family Grant program and government-sponsored disaster loan assistance, then money from the Cora Brown Fund will not be available to the applicant for the same purpose. Listed below are the general categories of assistance which can be provided by the Cora Brown Fund:

(1) Disaster-related home repair and rebuilding assistance to families for permanent housing purposes, including site acquisition and development, relocation of residences out of hazardous areas, assistance with costs associated with temporary housing or permanent rehousing (e.g., utility deposits, access, transportation, connection of utilities, etc.);

(2) Disaster-related unmet needs of families who are unable to obtain adequate assistance under the Act or from other sources. Such assistance may include but is not limited to: health and safety measures; evacuation costs; assistance delineated in the Act or other Federal, State, local, or volunteer programs; hazard mitigation or floodplain management purposes; and assistance to self-employed persons (with no employees) to reestablish their businesses; and

(3) Other services which alleviate human suffering and promote the well being of disaster victims. For example, services to the elderly, to children, or to handicapped persons, such as transportation, recreational programs, provision of special ramps, or hospital or home visiting services. The funds may be provided to individual disaster victims, or to benefit a group of disaster victims.

####### Conditions for use of the Cora Brown Fund.

(c)(1) The Cora Brown Fund is available only when the President declares that a major disaster or emergency exists under the Act, only in areas designated as eligible for Federal disaster assistance through notice in theand only at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The fund is limited to the initial endowment plus accrued interest, and this assistance program will cease when the fund is used up.

(2) A disaster victim normally will receive no more than $2,000 from this fund in any one declared disaster unless the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that a larger amount is in the best interest of the disaster victim and the Federal Government. Funds to provide service which benefit a group may be awarded in an amount determined by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, based on the Regional Administrator's recommendation.

(3) The fund may not be used in a way that is inconsistent with other federally mandated disaster assistance or insurance programs, or to modify other generally applicable requirements.

(4) Funds awarded to a disaster victim may be provided by FEMA jointly to the disaster victim and to a State or local agency, or volunteer organization, to enable such an agent to assist in providing the approved assistance to an applicant. Example: Repair funds may be provided jointly to an applicant and the Mennonite Disaster Service, who will coordinate the purchase of supplies and provide the labor.

(5) Money from this fund will not duplicate assistance for which a person is eligible from other sources.

(6) In order to comply with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234), as amended, any award for acquisition or construction purposes shall carry a requirement that any adequate flood insurance policy be purchased and maintained. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall determine what is adequate based on the purpose of the award.

(7) The fund shall be administered in an equitable and impartial manner without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or economic status.

(8) Funds awarded to a disaster victim from this fund may be combined with funds from other sources.

####### Administrative procedures.

(d)(1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall be responsible for awarding funds and authorizing disbursement.

(2) The Chief Financial Officer shall be responsible for fund accountability and, in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, for liaison with the Department of the Treasury concerning the investment of excess money in the fund pursuant to the provisions contained in section 601 of the Act.

(3) Each FEMA Regional Administrator may submit requests to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on a disaster victim's behalf by providing documentation describing the needs of the disaster victim, a verification of the disaster victim's claim, a record of other assistance which has been or will be available for the same purpose, and his/her recommendation as to the items and the amount. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall review the facts and make a determination. If the award amount is below $2,000, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may appoint a designee to have approval authority; approval authority of $2,000 or above shall be retained by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Chief Financial Officer of a decision for approval, and the Chief Financial Officer shall order a check to be sent to the disaster victim (or jointly to the disaster victim and an assistance organization), through the Regional Administrator. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall also notify the Regional Administrator of the decision, whether for approval or disapproval. The Regional Administrator shall notify the disaster victim in writing, identify any award as assistance from the Cora Brown Fund, and advise the recipient of appeal procedures.

(4) If the award is to be for a service to a group of disaster victims, the Regional Administrator shall submit his/her recommendation and supporting documentation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate (or his/her designee if the award is below $2,000), who shall review the information and make a determination. In cases of approval, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall request the Chief Financial Officer to send a check to the intended recipient or provider, as appropriate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Regional Administrator of the decision. The Regional Administrator shall notify a representative of the group in writing.

(5) The Chief Financial Officer shall process requests for checks, shall keep records of disbursements and balances in the account, and shall provide the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate with quarterly reports.

####### Audits.

(e)The Inspector General of DHS may audit the use of money in this account to determine whether the funds are being administered according to these regulations and whether the financial management of the account is adequate. The Inspector General shall provide his/her findings to the Administrator, for information, comments and appropriate action. A copy shall be provided to the Chief Financial Officer for the same purpose.

###### §§ 206.182-206.190 [Reserved]

###### § 206.191 Duplication of benefits.

####### Purpose.

(a)This section establishes the policies for implementing section 312 of the Stafford Act, entitled Duplication of Benefits. This section relates to assistance for individuals and families.

####### Government policy.

(b)(1) Federal agencies providing disaster assistance under the Act or under their own authorities triggered by the Act, shall cooperate to prevent and rectify duplication of benefits, according to the general policy guidance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The agencies shall establish appropriate agency policies and procedures to prevent duplication of benefits.

(2) Major disaster and emergency assistance provided to individuals and families under the Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments, and disaster assistance organizations, is not considered as income or a resource when determining eligibility for or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs. Examples of federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs are the food stamp program and welfare assistance programs.

####### FEMA policy.

(c)It is FEMA policy:

(1) To prevent duplication of benefits between its own programs and insurance benefits, and between its own programs and other disaster assistance. Assistance under the Act may be provided in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the agency providing the Federal assistance;

(2) To examine a debt resulting from duplication to determine that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions to remedy duplication which has occurred when other assistance has become available;

(3) To assure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, by consulting with other Federal agencies and by performing selected quality control reviews, that the other disaster relief agencies establish and follow policies and procedures to prevent and remedy duplication among their programs, other programs, and insurance benefits; and

(4) To coordinate the effort of agencies providing assistance so that each agency understands the prevention and remedial policies of the others and is able to fulfill its own responsibilities regarding duplication of benefits.

####### Guidance to prevent duplication of benefits.

(d)(1) Delivery sequence. FEMA provides the following policy and procedural guidance to ensure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits.

(i) Duplication occurs when an agency has provided assistance which was the primary responsibility of another agency, and the agency with primary responsibility later provides assistance. A delivery sequence establishes the order in which disaster relief agencies and organizations provide assistance. The specific sequence, in accordance with the mandates of the assistance programs, is to be generally followed in the delivery of assistance.

(ii) When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting agency is responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery sequence pertains to that period of time in the recovery phase when most of the traditional disaster assistance programs are available.

(2) The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery:

(i) Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable items such as clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance (including flood insurance);

(ii) Housing assistance pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford Act.

(iii) Small Business Administration and Farmers Home Administration disaster loans;

(iv) Other Needs assistance, pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford Act or its predecessor program, the Individual and Family Grant Program.

(v) Volunteer agencies' "additional assistance" programs; and

(vi) The "Cora Brown Fund."

(3) Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that:

(i) Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible for delivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program later in the sequence; and

(ii) The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can duplicate other assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate insurance benefits, however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the Federal assistance). An agency's position in the sequence determines the order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources it must consider before it does so.

(4) If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely affect the timely receipt of essential assistance by a disaster victim, an agency may offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of another agency. There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B) delivers assistance which is normally the primary responsibility of another agency (Agency A) because Agency A has, for good cause, denied assistance. After the assistance is delivered, Agency A reopens the case. If the primary response Agency A then provides assistance, that Agency A is responsible for coordinating with Agency B to either:

(i) Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or

(ii) In the case where the disaster victim has refused assistance from Agency A, notify Agency B that it must recover assistance previously provided.

####### Program guidance,Programs under the Act vs. other agency assistance.

(e)-(1)(i) In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA Regional Administrator, in the case of federally operated programs, or the State, in the case of State operated programs, shall determine whether assistance is the primary responsibility of another agency to provide, according to the delivery sequence; and determine whether that primary response agency can provide assistance in a timely way.

(ii) If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by the agency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing assistance under the Act. If it is determined that assistance from the agency with primary responsibility will be delayed, assistance under the Act may be provided, but then must be recovered from the applicant when the other assistance becomes available.

####### Programs under the Act vs. insurance.

(2)In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA Regional Administrator or State shall:

(i) Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an adequate settlement. The applicant must provide information concerning insurance recoveries.

(ii) Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be sufficient to cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and

(iii) Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood insurance) will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is involved, the Regional Administrator shall coordinate with the Federal Insurance Administration. The purpose of this coordination is to obtain information about flood insurance coverage and settlements.

####### Random sample.

(3)Each disaster assistance agency is responsible for preventing and rectifying duplication of benefits under the coordination of the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) and the general authority of section 312. To determine whether duplication has occurred and established procedures have been followed, the Regional Administrator shall, within 90 days after the close of the disaster assistance programs application period, for selected disaster declarations, examine on a random sample basis, FEMA's and other government and voluntary agencies' case files and document the findings in writing.

####### Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved.

(4)If duplication is discovered, the Regional Administrator shall determine whether the duplicating agency followed its own remedial procedures.

(i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successful in correcting the duplication, the Regional Administrator will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication, and the Regional Administrator is satisfied that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further action will be taken.

(ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefits procedures, or the Regional Administrator is not satisfied that the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then the Regional Administrator shall provide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the debt, if it is determined that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions, then take those recovery actions in conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the random sample (or larger universe, at the Regional Administrator's discretion).

####### Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved.

(5)When the random sample shows evidence that duplication has occurred and corrective action is required, the Regional Administrator and the FCO shall urge the duplicating agency to follow its own procedures to take corrective action, and shall work with the agency toward that end. Under his/her authority in section 312, the Regional Administrator shall require the duplicating agency to report to him/her on its attempt to correct the duplications identified in the sample.

####### Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection.

(f)Funds due to FEMA are recovered in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's Debt Collection Regulations (6 CFR part 11-Claims).

(d)Requests for time extensions beyond the recipient's authority shall be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator and shall include the following:

(1) The dates and provisions of all previous time extensions on the project; and

(2) A detailed justification for the delay and a projected completion date. The Regional Administrator shall review the request and make a determination. The recipient shall be notified of the Regional Administrator's determination in writing. If the Regional Administrator approves the request, the letter shall reflect the approved completion date and any other requirements the Regional Administrator may determine necessary to ensure that the new completion date is met. If the Regional Administrator denies the time extension request, the recipient may, upon completion of the project, be reimbursed for eligible project costs incurred only up to the latest approved completion date. If the project is not completed, no Federal funding will be provided for that project.

####### Cost Overruns.

(e)(1) During the execution of approved work a subrecipient may find that the actual project costs exceed the approved Project Worksheet estimates. Such cost overruns normally fall into the following three categories:

(i) Variations in unit prices;

(ii) Change in the scope of eligible work; or

(iii) Delays in timely starts or completion of eligible work.

(2) The subrecipient must evaluate each cost overrun and, when justified, submit a request for additional funding through the recipient to the Regional Administrator for a final determination. All requests for the Regional Administrator's approval will contain sufficient documentation to support the eligibility of all claimed work and costs. The recipient must include a written recommendation when forwarding the request. The Regional Administrator will notify the recipient in writing of the final determination. FEMA will not normally review an overrun for an individual small project. The normal procedure for small projects will be that when a subrecipient discovers a significant overrun related to the total final cost for all small projects, the subrecipient may submit an appeal for additional funding in accordance with § 206.206, within 60 days following the completion of all its small projects.

####### Progress reports.

(f)Progress reports will be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator quarterly. The Regional Administrator and recipient shall negotiate the date for submission of the first report. Such reports will describe the status of those projects on which a final payment of the Federal share has not been made to the recipient and outline any problems or circumstances expected to result in noncompliance with the approved grant conditions.

###### § 206.205 Payment of claims.

####### Small Projects.

(a)Final payment of the Federal share of these projects will be made to the recipient upon approval of the Project Worksheet. The recipient will make payment of the Federal share to the subrecipient as soon as practicable after Federal approval of funding. Before the closeout of the disaster contract, the recipient must certify that all such projects were completed in accordance with FEMA approvals and that the State contribution to the non-Federal share, as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement, has been paid to each subrecipient. Such certification is not required to specify the amount spent by a subrecipient on small projects. The Federal payment for small projects shall not be reduced if all of the approved funds are not spent to complete a project. However, failure to complete a project may require that the Federal payment be refunded.

####### Large projects.

(b)(1) The recipient shall make an accounting to the Regional Administrator of eligible costs for each approved large project. In submitting the accounting the recipient shall certify that reported costs were incurred in the performance of eligible work, that the approved work was completed, that the project is in compliance with the provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement, and that payments for that project have been made in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305. Each large project shall be submitted as soon as practicable after the subrecipient has completed the approved work and requested payment.

(2) The Regional Administrator shall review the accounting to determine the eligible amount of reimbursement for each large project and approve eligible costs. If a discrepancy between reported costs and approved funding exists, the Regional Administrator may conduct field reviews to gather additional information. If discrepancies in the claim cannot be resolved through a field review, a Federal audit may be conducted. If the Regional Administrator determines that eligible costs exceed the initial approval, he/she will obligate additional funds as necessary.

Direct Federal assistance is also subject to the eligibility criteria contained in Subpart H of these regulations. FEMA will reimburse other Federal agencies in accordance with Subpart A of these regulations.

####### Requests for assistance.

(b)All requests for direct Federal assistance shall be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator and shall include:

(1) A written agreement that the State will:

(i) Provide without cost to the United States all lands, easements and rights-of-ways necessary to accomplish the approved work;

###### § 206.250 General.

(a) Sections 311 and 406(d) of the Stafford Act, and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, set forth certain insurance requirements which apply to disaster assistance provided by FEMA. The requirements of this subpart apply to all assistance provided pursuant to section 406 of the Stafford Act with respect to any major disaster declared by the President after November 23, 1988.

(b) Insurance requirements prescribed in this subpart shall apply equally to private nonprofit (PNP) facilities which receive assistance under section 406 of the Act. PNP organizations shall submit the necessary documentation and assurances required by this subpart to the recipient.

(c) Actual and anticipated insurance recoveries shall be deducted from otherwise eligible costs, in accordance with this subpart.

(d) The full coverage available under the standard flood insurance policy from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will be subtracted from otherwise eligible costs for a building and its contents within the special flood hazard area in accordance with § 206.252.

(e) The insurance requirements of this subpart should not be interpreted as a substitute for various hazard mitigation techniques which may be available to reduce the incidence and severity of future damage.

###### § 206.251 Definitions.

####### Assistance

(a)means any form of a Federal grant under section 406 of the Stafford Act to replace, restore, repair, reconstruct, or construct any facility and/or its contents as a result of a major disaster.

####### Special flood hazard area

(e)means an area having special flood, mudslide, and/or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by FEMA as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1-30 VE, V, M, or E. "Special flood hazard area" is synonymous with "special hazard area", as defined in 44 CFR part 59.

####### Standard Flood Insurance Policy

(f)means the flood insurance policy issued by the Federal Insurance Administrator, or by a Write-Your-Own Company pursuant to 44 CFR 62.23.

###### § 206.252 Insurance requirements for facilities damaged by flood.

(a) Where an insurable building damaged by flooding is located in a special flood hazard area identified for more than one year by the Administrator, assistance pursuant to section 406 of the Stafford Act shall be reduced. The amount of the reduction shall be the maximum amount of the insurance proceeds which would have been received had the building and its contents been fully covered by a standard flood insurance policy.

(b) The reduction stated above shall not apply to a PNP facility which could not be insured because it was located in a community not participating in the NFIP. However, the provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 prohibit approval of assistance for the PNP unless the community agrees to participate in the NFIP within six months after the major disaster declaration date, and the required flood insurance is purchased.

(c) Prior to approval of a Federal grant for the restoration of a facility and its contents which were damaged by a flood, the recipient shall notify the Regional Administrator of any entitlement to an insurance settlement or recovery. The Regional Administrator shall reduce the eligible costs by the amount of insurance proceeds which the recipient receives.

(d) The recipient or subrecipient is required to obtain and maintain flood insurance in the amount of eligible disaster assistance, as a condition of receiving Federal assistance that may be available. This requirement also applies to insurable flood damaged facilities located outside a special flood hazard area when it is reasonably available, adequate, and necessary. However, the Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and amounts of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner. The requirement to purchase flood insurance is waived when eligible costs for an insurable facility do not exceed $5,000.

###### § 206.253 Insurance requirements for facilities damaged by disasters other than flood.

(a) Prior to approval of a Federal grant for the restoration of a facility and its contents which were damaged by a disaster other than flood, the recipient shall notify the Regional Administrator of any entitlement to insurance settlement or recovery for such facility and its contents. The Regional Administrator shall reduce the eligible costs by the actual amount of insurance proceeds relating to the eligible costs.

(b)(1) Assistance under section 406 of the Stafford Act will be approved only on the condition that the recipient obtain and maintain such types and amounts of insurance as are reasonable and necessary to protect against future loss to such property from the types of hazard which caused the major disaster. The extent of insurance to be required will be based on the eligible damage that was incurred to the damaged facility as a result of the major disaster. The Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.

(2) Due to the high cost of insurance, some applicants may request to insure the damaged facilities under a blanket insurance policy covering all their facilities, an insurance pool arrangement, or some combination of these options. Such an arrangement may be accepted for other than flood damages. However, if the same facility is damaged in a similar future disaster, eligible costs will be reduced by the amount of eligible damage sustained on the previous disaster.

(c) The Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the type and amount of insurance required. The recipient may request that the State Insurance Commissioner review the type and extent of insurance required to protect against future loss to a disaster-damaged facility, the Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.

(d) The requirements of section 311 of the Stafford Act are waived when eligible costs for an insurable facility do not exceed $5,000. The Regional Administrator may establish a higher waiver amount based on hazard mitigation initiatives which reduce the risk of future damages by a disaster similar to the one which resulted in the major disaster declaration which is the basis for the application for disaster assistance.

(e) The recipient shall provide assurances that the required insurance coverage will be maintained for the anticipated life of the restorative work or the insured facility, whichever is the lesser.

(f) No assistance shall be provided under section 406 of the Stafford Act for any facility for which assistance was provided as a result of a previous major disaster unless all insurance required by FEMA as a condition of the previous assistance has been obtained and maintained.

This subpart specifies what actions may and may not be carried out within the CBRS. It establishes procedures for compliance with CBRA in the administration of disaster assistance by FEMA.

###### § 206.341 Policy.

It shall be the policy of FEMA to achieve the goals of CBRA in carrying out disaster relief on units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System. It is FEMA's intent that such actions be consistent with the purpose of CBRA to minimize the loss of human life, the wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and to consider the means and measures by which the long-term conservation of these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved under the Stafford Act.

###### § 206.342 Definitions.

In addition, a legally valid building permit or equivalent documentation, if required, must have been obtained for the construction prior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been substantially improved or expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an existing facility. For any other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to Public Law 97-348, the enactment date of such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.

####### Expansion

(d)means changing a facility to increase its capacity or size.

####### Substantial improvement

(j)means any repair, reconstruction or other improvement of a structure or facility, that has been damaged in excess of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50 percent of the market value of the structure or placement cost of the facility (including all "public facilities") as defined in the Stafford Act) either:

(1) Before the repair or improvement is started; or

####### substantial improvement

(2) If the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to be restored, before the damage occurred. If a facility is a link in a larger system, the percentage of damage will be based on the relative cost of repairing the damaged facility to the replacement cost of that portion of the system which is operationally dependent on the facility. The termdoes not include any alternation of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

####### System unit

(k)means any undeveloped coastal barrier, or combination of closely related undeveloped coastal barriers included within the Coastal Barrier Resources System as established by the section 4 of the CBRA, or as modified by the Secretary in accordance with that statute.

###### § 206.343 Scope.

##### Subpart K - Community Disaster Loans

###### § 206.360 Purpose.

This subpart provides policies and procedures for local governments and State and Federal officials concerning the Community Disaster Loan program under section 417 of the Stafford Act. Sections 206.360 through 206.367 of the subpart do not implement the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005. (see § 206.370).

###### § 206.361 Loan program.

####### General.

(a)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions.

####### Amount of loan.,fiscal year

(b)The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs, but shall not exceed $5 million. The termas used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.

####### Interest rate.

(c)The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, adjusted to the nearestpercent.

####### Time limitation.

(d)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year. Only one loan may be approved under section 417(a) for any local government as the result of a single disaster.

####### Term of loan.

(e)The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider requests for an extensions of loans based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the Community Disaster Loan recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment. (See § 206.367(c).)

####### Use of loan funds.

(f)The local government shall use the loaned funds to carry on existing local government functions of a municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disaster-related needs. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the nonFederal share of any Federal program, including those under the Act.

####### Cancellation.

(g)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the 3 fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.

####### Relation to other assistance.

(h)Any community disaster loans including cancellations made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance under the Act or these regulations.

###### § 206.362 Responsibilities.

(a) The local government shall submit the financial information required by FEMA in the application for a Community Disaster Loan and in the application for loan cancellation, if submitted, and comply with the assurances on the application, the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, and these regulations. The local government shall send all loan application, loan administration, loan cancellation, and loan settlement correspondence through the GAR and the FEMA Regional Office to the FEMA Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(b) The GAR shall certify on the loan application that the local government can legally assume the proposed indebtedness and that any proceeds will be used and accounted for in compliance with the FEMA-State Agreement for the major disaster. States are encouraged to take appropriate pre-disaster action to resolve any existing State impediments which would preclude a local government from incurring the increased indebtedness associated with a loan in order to avoid protracted delays in processing loan application requests in major disasters or emergencies.

(c) The Regional Administrator or designee shall review each loan application or loan cancellation request received from a local government to ensure that it contains the required documents and transmit the application to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. He/she may submit appropriate recommendations to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(d) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, or a designee, shall execute a Promissory Note with the local government, and the FEMA Finance Center, shall administer the loan until repayment or cancellation is completed and the Promissory Note is discharged.

(e) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve or disapprove each loan request, taking into consideration the information provided in the local government's request and the recommendations of the GAR and the Regional Administrator. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve or disapprove a request for loan cancellation in accordance with the criteria for cancellation in these regulations.

(f) The Chief Financial Officer shall establish and maintain a financial account for each outstanding loan and disburse funds against the Promissory Note.

###### § 206.363 Eligibility criteria.

####### Local government.

(a)(1) The local government must be located within the area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate as eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.

(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential municipal operating services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.

####### Loan eligibility,General.

(b)-(1)To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, and must not be in arrears with respect to any payments due on previous loans. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application.

####### Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.

(2)The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:

(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential municipal services provided prior to the disaster;

(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year;

####### Demonstrated need for financial assistance.

(3)The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination include the following:

(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;

(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;

(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;

(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;

(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);

(vi) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;

(vii) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;

(viii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential municipal services; and

(ix) Danger of municipal insolvency.

###### § 206.364 Loan application.

####### Application.

(a)(1) The local government shall submit an application for a Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.367(c)).

(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy for the submission. The Governor's Authorized Representative may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.

####### Financial requirements.

(b)(1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see § 206.364(b)(2)) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results-Cash Position, a Debt History, Tax Assessment Data, Financial Projections, Other Information, a Certification, and the Assurances listed on the application.

(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.

(ii) Each application for a Community Disaster Loan must also include:

(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and

(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinance, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.

####### Operating budget.

(2)For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term "operating budget" to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.

####### Operating budget increases.

(3)Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.

####### Revenue and assessment information.

(4)The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due. Tax revenues assessed but not collected, or other revenues which the local government chooses to forgive, stay, or otherwise not exercise the right to collect, are not a legitimate revenue loss for purposes of evaluating the loan application.

####### Estimated disaster-related expense.

(5)Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated. These are discussed in § 206.366(b).

####### Federal review.

(c)(1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental function as the result of the disaster.

####### Resubmission of application.

(2)If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be resubmitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.

####### Community disaster loan.

(d)(1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:

(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or

(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.

####### Promissory note.

(2)(i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see § 206.364(d)(2)(ii)). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.

(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.

###### § 206.365 Loan administration.

####### Funding.

(a)(1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local government when requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Increments in the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue against each disbursement.

(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds. A sinking fund should be established to amortize the debt.

####### Financial management.

(b)(1) Each local government with an approved Community Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistent with local government's financial management system, to account for loan funds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail.

(2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, and the Comptroller General of the United States or their duly authorized representatives shall, for the purpose of audits and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records that pertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under these regulations.

####### Loan servicing.

(c)(1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMA copies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets, etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3 subsequent fiscal years.

(2) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, will review the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.

(3) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis. The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipal official who executed the Promissory Note.

####### Inactive loans.

(d)If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA. However, since only one loan may be approved, cancellation precludes submission of a second loan application request by the same local government for the same disaster.

###### § 206.366 Loan cancellation.

####### Policies.,operating budget

(a)(1) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets that termto mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.

(2) If the tax and other revenues rates or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the 3 fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax and other revenue rates and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received. This may result in decreasing the potential for loan cancellations.

(3) If the local government's fiscal year is changed during the "full 3 year period following the disaster" the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period.

(4) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.

(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite predisaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.

####### Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.

(b)(1) For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal Finance Officers Association.

(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.

(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:

(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.

(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.

(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.

(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.

(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Community Disaster Loan purposes:

(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act.

(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.

(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.

(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's project application.

####### Cancellation application.

(c)A local government which has drawn loan funds from the Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.

(1) Financial information submitted with the application shall include the following:

(i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the 3 subsequent fiscal years;

(ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copies of the local government's annual financial reports, including operating statements balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from those in the supporting financial reports.

(iii) The following additional information concerning annual real estate property taxes pertaining to the community for each of the above fiscal years:

(A) The market value of the tax base (dollars);

(B) The assessment ratio (percent);

(C) The assessed valuation (dollars);

(D) The tax levy rate (mils);

(E) Taxes levied and collected (dollars).

(iv) Audit reports for each of the above fiscal years certifying to the validity of the Operating Statements. The financial statements of the local government shall be examined in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants.

(v) Other financial information specified in the Application for Loan Cancellation.

####### Narrative justification.

(2)The application may include a narrative presentation to amplify the financial material accompanying the application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.

####### Determination.

(d)(1) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the principal amount which is canceled will become a grant, and the related interest will be forgiven. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid immediately and that, if immediate repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.

(2) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant.

(3) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance with § 206.367.

####### Appeals.

(4)If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, the local government may submit any additional information in support of the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee on the submission is final.

###### § 206.367 Loan repayment.

####### Prepayments.

(a)The local government may make prepayments against loan at any time without any prepayment penalty.

####### Repayment.

(b)To the extent not otherwise cancelled, Community Disaster Loan funds become due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The note shall include the following provisions:

(1) The term of a loan made under this program is 5 years, unless extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Interest will accrue on outstanding cash from the actual date of its disbursement by the Treasury.

(2) The interest amount due will be computed separately for each Treasury disbursement as follows: I = P x R x T, where I = the amount of simple interest, P = the principal amount disbursed; R = the interest rate of the loan; and, T = the outstanding term in years from the date of disbursement to date of repayment, with periods less than 1 year computed on the basis of 365 days/year. If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interest amount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortest outstanding term.

(3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interest computed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time and shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loan and shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaining installments.

(4) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may defer payments of principal and interest until FEMA makes its final determination with respect to any Application for Loan Cancellation which the borrower may submit. However, interest will continue to accrue.

(5) Any costs incurred by the Federal Government in collecting the note shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan, bear interest at the same rate as the loan, and be immediately due without demand.

(6) In the event of default on this note by the borrower, the FEMA claims collection officer will take action to recover the outstanding principal plus related interest under Federal debt collection authorities, including administrative offset against other Federal funds due the borrower and/or referral to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement and collection.

####### Additional time.

(c)In unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the local government may request an additional period of time beyond the original 10 year term to repay the indebtedness.

(2) The principal amount shall be the original uncancelled principal plus related interest.

(3) The interest rate shall be the Treasury rate in effect at the time the new Promissory Note is executed but in no case less than the original interest rate.

(4) The term of the new Promissory Note shall be for the settlement period requested by the local government but not greater than 10 years from the date the new note is executed.

###### §§ 206.368-206.369 [Reserved]

###### § 206.370 Purpose and scope.

####### Purpose.

(a)Sections 206.370 through 206.377 provide procedures for local governments and State and Federal officials concerning the Special Community Disaster Loans program under section 417 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5184), the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005, Public Law 109-88, and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Public Law 109-234.

####### Scope.

(b)Sections 206.370 through 206.377 apply only to Special Community Disaster Loans issued under the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005, Public Law 109-88, and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, Public Law 109-234.

###### § 206.371 Loan program.

####### General.

(a)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Special Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to provide essential services.

####### Amount of loan.

(b)The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs. The term fiscal year as used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.

####### Interest rate.,unusual circumstances involving financial hardship

(c)The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States. If an applicant can demonstrate, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a rate equal to the five year maturity rate plus 1 per centum, adjusted to the nearestpercent, and further reduced by one-half.

####### Time limitation.

(d)The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year.

####### Term of loan.

(e)The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider a request for an extension of a loan based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) of the Stafford Act normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment (see § 206.377(c)).

####### Use of loan funds.

(f)The local government shall use the loaned funds to assist in providing essential services. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the non-Federal share of any Federal program, including those under the Stafford Act.

####### Relation to other assistance.

(g)Any Special Community Disaster Loans including cancellations of loans made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance provided under the authority of the Stafford Act or this part.

####### Cancellation.

(h)The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the three full fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.

###### § 206.372 Responsibilities.

(a) The local government shall submit the financial information required by FEMA in the application for a Community Disaster Loan or other format specified by FEMA and comply with the assurances on the application, the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, the application for loan cancellation, if submitted, and §§ 206.370 through 206.377. The local government shall send all loan application, loan administration, loan cancellation, and loan settlement correspondence through the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR) and the FEMA Regional Office to the Director of the Public Assistance Division.

(b) The GAR shall certify on the loan application that the local government can legally assume the proposed indebtedness and that any proceeds will be used and accounted for in compliance with the FEMA-State Agreement for the major disaster. States are encouraged to take appropriate pre-disaster action to resolve any existing State impediments which would preclude a local government from incurring the increased indebtedness associated with a loan in order to avoid protracted delays in processing loan application requests resulting from major disasters.

(c) The Regional Administrator or designee shall review each loan application or loan cancellation request received from a local government to ensure that it contains the required documents and transmit the application to the Director of the Public Assistance Division. He/she may also submit appropriate recommendations to the Director of the Public Assistance Division.

(d) The Director of the Public Assistance Division or a designee, shall execute a Promissory Note with the local government and shall administer the loan until repayment or cancellation is completed and the Promissory Note is discharged.

(e) The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall approve or disapprove each loan request, taking into consideration the information provided in the local government's request and the recommendations of the GAR and the Regional Administrator. The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall approve or disapprove a request for loan cancellation in accordance with the criteria for cancellation in these regulations.

(f) The FEMA Chief Financial Officer shall establish and maintain a financial account for each outstanding loan and disburse funds against the Promissory Note.

###### § 206.373 Eligibility criteria.

####### Local government.

(a)(1) The local government must be located within the area eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.

(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Special Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Stafford Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.

####### Loan eligibility,General.

(b)-(1)To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, and it must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to provide essential municipal services. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application.

####### Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.

(2)The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:

(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential services provided prior to the disaster;

(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year.

####### Demonstrated need for financial assistance.

(3)The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination may include some or all of the following factors:

(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;

(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;

(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;

(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;

(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);

(vi) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;

(vii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential services; and

(viii) Danger of municipal insolvency.

###### § 206.374 Loan application.

####### Application.

(a)(1) The local government shall submit an application for a Special Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.377(c)).

(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy of the submission. The GAR may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.

####### Financial requirements.

(b)(1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results-Cash Position, and certification and assurances requested by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must, unless impracticable, accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.

(ii) Each application for a Special Community Disaster Loan must also include:

(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and

(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinances, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.

####### Operating budget.

(2)For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term "operating budget" to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.

####### Operating budget increases.

(3)Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.

####### Revenue and assessment information.

(4)The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due.

####### Estimated disaster-related expense.

(5)Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated.

####### Federal review.

(c)(1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance as the result of the disaster to provide essential municipal services.

####### Resubmission of application.

(2)If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be submitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.

####### Special Community Disaster Loan.

(d)(1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:

(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or

(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.

####### Promissory note.

(2)(i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.

(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.

####### Waiver of requirements.

(e)Notwithstanding any other provision of this or other sections promulgated pursuant to Public Law 109-88, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may, upon the request of an applicant or loan recipient, waive any specific application requirement or financial reporting requirement (see, e.g., § 206.375(a)(2)) upon a finding by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate that the effects of the major disaster prevent the applicant from fulfilling the application requirement and that waiving the requirements would be consistent with the purposes of the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005.

###### § 206.375 Loan administration.

####### Funding.

(a)(1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local government when requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Increments in the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue against each disbursement.

(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds.

####### Financial management.

(b)(1) Each local government with an approved Special Community Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistent with local government's financial management system, to account for loan funds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail.

(2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, and the Comptroller General of the United States or their duly authorized representatives shall, for the purpose of audits and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records that pertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under §§ 206.370 through 206.377.

####### Loan servicing.

(c)(1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMA copies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets, etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3 subsequent fiscal years.

(2) FEMA will review the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.

(3) FEMA shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis. The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipal official who executed the Promissory Note.

####### Inactive loans.

(d)If no funds have been disbursed from the loan program, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA.

###### § 206.376 Loan cancellation.

(a) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Director of the Public Assistance Division determines that revenues of the local government during the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character.

####### Definitions.

(b)For loan cancellation purposes,

(1) "Operating budget" means actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.

(2) "Revenue" means any source of income from taxes, fees, fines, and other sources of income, and will be recognized only as they become susceptible to accrual (measurable and available).

(3) "Three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster" means either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005, or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster, at the applicant's discretion.

(4) "Operating expenses" means those expenses and expenditures incurred as a result of performing services, including salaries and benefits, contractual services, and commodities. Capital expenditures and debt service payments and capital leases are not considered operating expenses. Under accrual accounting, expenses are recognized as soon as a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.

####### Revenue Calculation procedures.

(c)(1) If the tax rates and other revenues or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the three full fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax rates and other revenues and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received.

(2) At the applicant's discretion, the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster is either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005 or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster. If the applicant's fiscal year is changed within the 36 months immediately following the disaster, the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period. Should the applicant elect the 36-month period beginning September 1, 2005, FEMA will prorate the revenues and expenses for the partial years based on the applicant's annual financial statements.

(3) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.

(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of property taxes that are transferred to other funds for Debt Service or Pension Obligations funding will not be excluded from the calculation of the operating budget or from expenditures in calculation of the operating deficit, to the extent that the property tax revenues in the General Fund are less than they were pre-disaster. FEMA will consider the impact of the loss of property tax revenue in Debt Service or Pension Funds (non-operating funds) if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) The entity experienced a loss of property tax revenue as a result of the disaster and the assessed value during the three years following the disaster, in the aggregate, is less than the pre-disaster assessed value;

(ii) the entity has a property tax cap limitation on the ability to raise property taxes post-disaster; and

(iii) the property taxes are levied through the General Operating Fund and transfers for obligations mandated by law are made to fund Debt Service or Pension Obligations which result in the entity experiencing a reduction of property tax revenues in the General Fund.

(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite pre-disaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.

(6) The provisions of this section apply to all Special Community Disaster loans issued from the dates of enactment of Public Law 109-88 and Public Law 109-234.

####### Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.

(d)(1) For purposes of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, including but not limited to police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance.

(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.

(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:

(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.

(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.

(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.

(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.

(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Special Community Disaster Loan purposes:

(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Stafford Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5172).

(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.

(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.

(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's Project Application.

####### Cancellation application.

(e)A local government which has drawn loan funds from the U.S. Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.

(1) Financial information submitted with the application shall include the following:

(i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the three subsequent fiscal years;

(ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copies of the local government's annual financial reports, including operating statements and balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from those in the supporting financial reports.

####### Narrative justification.

(2)The application may include a narrative presentation to supplement the financial material accompanying the application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the Director of the Public Assistance Division to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.

####### Determination.

(f)(1) The Director of the Public Assistance Division will make a cancellation determination within 60 days of the date the applicant submits all required and requested information, including documentation in support of un-reimbursed disaster related expenses.

(2) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, the Director of the Public Assistance Division determines that all or part of the Special Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the amount of principal canceled and the related interest will be forgiven. The Director of the Public Assistance Division's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, and that, if repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on a timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

(3) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant.

(4) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance with § 206.377.

####### Appeals.

(5)If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Director of the Public Assistance Division, the local government may submit any additional information in support of the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the additional information is final.

###### § 206.377 Loan repayment.

####### Prepayments.

(a)The local government may make prepayments against loan at any time without any prepayment penalty.

####### Repayment.

(b)To the extent not otherwise cancelled, loan funds become due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The note shall include the following provisions:

(2) The interest amount due will be computed separately for each Treasury disbursement as follows: I = P X R X T, where I = the amount of simple interest, P = the principal amount disbursed; R = the interest rate of the loan; and, T = the outstanding term in years from the date of disbursement to date of repayment, with periods less than 1 year computed on the basis of 365 days/year. If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interest amount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortest outstanding term.

(3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interest computed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time and shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loan and shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaining installments.

(4) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may defer payments of principal and interest until FEMA makes its final determination with respect to any Application for Loan Cancellation which the borrower may submit. However, interest will continue to accrue.

(5) Any costs incurred by the Federal Government in collecting the note shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan, bear interest at the same rate as the loan, and be immediately due without demand.

(6) In the event of default on this note by the borrower, the FEMA claims collection officer will take action to recover the outstanding principal plus related interest under Federal debt collection authorities, including administrative offset against other Federal funds due the borrower and/or referral to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement and collection.

####### Additional time.

(c)In unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the local government may request an additional period of time beyond the original 10 year term to repay the indebtedness.

The Regional Administrator will recommend to the Chief Financial Officer whether to approve the extension, change, or interim obligation. Extensions, changes to the lock-in, or interim obligations will not be made without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer.

(e) The Chief Financial Officer may change the amount of the lock-in or the cap, or extend the time before lock-in, if the Chief Financial Officer determines that the projections used to determine the lock-in were inaccurate to such a degree that the change to the lock-in would be material, or for other reasons in his or her discretion that may reasonably warrant such changes. The Chief Financial Officer will not make such changes without consultation with the grantee and the Regional Administrator.

###### § 208.12 Maximum Pay Rate Table.

####### Purpose.

(a)This section establishes the process for creating and updating the Maximum Pay Rate Table (Table), and the Table's use to reimburse Affiliated Personnel (Task Force Physicians, Task Force Engineers, and Canine Handlers) and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency. Section 208.32 defines the "Maximum Pay Rate Table" as "the DHS-issued table that identifies the maximum pay rates for selected System positions that may be used for reimbursement of Affiliated Personnel compensation and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency." In that same section, the term "Affiliated Personnel" is defined as "individuals not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency and individuals normally affiliated with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency as volunteers."

####### Scope of this section.

(b)(1) The Maximum Pay Rate Table applies to those individuals who are not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency, or whose affiliation with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency is as a volunteer; that is, an individual whom the Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency does not normally compensate in any way, at any rate.

(2) The Table also applies to Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.

####### Method for determining maximum pay rates.

(c)(1) DHS uses the United States Office of Personnel Management's salary rates, computed under 5 U.S.C. 5504, as the basis for the maximum pay rate schedule. DHS considers System members' experience and sets maximum pay rates at the maximum grade, middle step for each position, which demonstrates an experience level of five years.

(2) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes salary and locality pay schedules each calendar year.

####### Physicians.,http://www.opm.gov/oca/03 tables/SSR/HTML/0290.asp.

(i)DHS uses the latest Special Salary Rate Table Number 0290 for Medical Officers (Clinical) Worldwide for physicians. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at

####### Engineers and Canine Handlers.,http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/html/gs.asp.

(ii)DHS uses the latest General Schedule pay scale for both positions. Both specialties are compared to the General Schedule pay scale to ensure parity with like specialties on a task force (canine handlers are equated with rescue specialists). The rates used in the initial Table can be found at

####### Locality Pay.,http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/locdef.asp.

(iii)To determine adjustments for locality pay DHS uses the latest locality pay areas (including the "Rest of U.S." area) established by OPM. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at

####### Review and update.

(3)DHS will review and update the Table periodically, at least annually. The comments of Sponsoring and Participating Agencies and their experience with the Table will be considered and evaluated in the course of the reviews.

####### Initial rates and subsequent revisions.

(4)DHS will publish the initial maximum pay rate table in theas a notice with request for comments. Subsequent revisions will be made to the pay rate table as OPM changes salary rates as described in this section. When subsequent revisions are made to the maximum pay rate table DHS will publish the new maximum pay rate table in theThe rates will be effective for the latest year indicated by OPM.

####### Application of the maximum pay rate table,Applicability.

(d)-(1)The Maximum Pay Rate Table sets forth maximum rates for which DHS will reimburse the Sponsoring Agency for compensation paid to Activated Affiliated Personnel and as Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.

####### Higher rates.

(2)The Sponsoring Agency may choose to pay Affiliated Personnel at a higher rate, but DHS will not reimburse the increment above the maximum rate specified in the Maximum Pay Rate Table. Likewise, the Sponsoring Agency may choose to enter into a Participating Agency agreement with the individual's employer, rather than use the individual as an Affiliated Personnel, in which case the Maximum Pay Rate Table would not apply.

####### Compensation for Sponsoring Agency employees serving as Affiliated Personnel.,e.g.

###### We, our,,us

ormeans FEMA.

##### § 209.3 Roles and responsibilities.

The following describes the general roles of FEMA, the State, local communities or other organizations that receive grant assistance, and participating homeowners.

###### Federal.

(a)We will notify States about the availability of funds, and will allocate available funding to States that received major disaster declarations during the period covered by the supplemental authority. Our Regional Administrators will verify project eligibility, provide technical assistance to States upon request, make grant awards, and oversee program implementation.

###### State.

(b)The State will be the Grantee to which we award funds and will be accountable for the use of those funds. The State will determine priorities for funding within the State. This determination must be made in conformance with the HMGP project identification and selection criteria (44 CFR 206.435). The State also will provide technical assistance and oversight to applicants for project development and to subgrantees for project implementation. The State will report program progress and results to us. The States also will recover and return to us any funds made available from other sources for the same purposes. When Native American tribes apply directly to us, they will be the grantee and carry out "state" roles.

###### Applicant (pre-award) and subgrantee (post-award).

(c)The applicant (a State agency, local government, or qualified private nonprofit organization) will coordinate with interested homeowners to complete an application to the State. The subgrantee implements all approved projects, generally takes title to all property, and agrees to dedicate and maintain the property in perpetuity for uses compatible with open-space, recreational, or wetlands management practices. The subgrantee will receive, review and make final decisions about any appraisal disputes that are brought by participating homeowners. The subgrantee is accountable to the State, as well as to us, for the use of funds.

###### Participating homeowners.

(d)The participating homeowners will notify the community of their interest to participate; provide necessary information to the community coordinator about property ownership, disaster damage, and other disaster benefits received or available; review the offer made from the community; and accept it or request a review appraisal.

##### § 209.4 Allocation and availability of funds.

(a) We will allocate available funds based on the number and value of properties that meet the eligibility criteria and whose owners want to participate in an acquisition or elevation project.

(b) We may reallocate funds for which we do not receive and approve adequate applications. We will obligate most available funds within 12 months following the deadline for submitting applications, unless extenuating circumstances exist.

##### § 209.5 Applicant eligibility.

The following are eligible to apply to the State for a grant:

(a) State and local governments;

(b) Indian tribes or authorized tribal organizations. A tribe may apply either to the State or directly to us; and

(c) Qualified private nonprofit organizations.

##### § 209.6 Project eligibility.

###### Eligible types of project activities.

(a)This grant authority is for projects to acquire floodprone properties and demolish or relocate structures per § 209.10(i), or to elevate floodprone structures. Approved projects must meet the following criteria and comply with all other program requirements described in this rule;

###### Eligibility criteria.

(b)To be eligible, projects must:

(1) Be cost effective. The State will complete an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the project, in accordance with our guidance and using a methodology that we approve. We will review the State's analysis;

(2) Include only properties that:

(i) For acquisition, the owner agrees to sell voluntarily;

(ii) Are within the 100-year floodplain based on best available data or as identified by a FIRM or FEMA-approved Disaster Recovery Map;

(iii) Were made uninhabitable (as certified by an appropriate State or local official) by the effects of a declared major disaster during federal fiscal years 1999 or 2000;

(iv) For acquisition, had a pre-event fair market value of less than $300,000 just before the disaster event. Properties submitted for buyout under Pub. L. 106-113 (the original Hurricane Floyd supplemental buyout program) are exempt from this policy, with the limitation that in no case does the Federal share or offer for any such property exceed $225,000; and

(v) Served as the principal residence for the owner. For multifamily units such as condominium buildings, all units within the structure should be principal residences of the owners and not sublet.

(3) Conform with 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and other applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy.

(c) For acquisition projects, an owner who is not a United States citizen or qualified alien may receive current fair market value for his or her property. He or she may not receive additional amounts for pre-event fair market value.

(d) Funds available under Pub. L. 106-113 (the original Floyd supplemental appropriation) are limited to use for acquisition purposes only.

##### § 209.7 Priorities for project selection.

(a) It is the State's responsibility to identify and select eligible buyout projects for funding under the supplemental grant program. All funded projects must be consistent with the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. The mitigation planning process or any other appropriate means may identify buyout and elevation projects.

(b) States will set priorities in their State mitigation plan to use as the basis for selecting projects for funding. The State's priorities will address, at a minimum, substantially damaged properties, repetitive loss target properties, and such other criteria that the State deems necessary to comply with the law. States and subgrantees are to give priority consideration to projects for acquisition or elevations of repetitive loss properties, and must include all eligible repetitive loss properties in the projects submitted to us for funding.

##### § 209.8 Application and review process.

###### General.

(a)This section describes the procedures to be used by the State in submitting an application for funding under the Supplemental Property Acquisition and Elevation Assistance program. Under this program, the State is the grantee and is responsible for processing subgrants to applicants in accordance with 44 CFR part 13 and this part.

###### Timeframes.

(b)We will establish deadlines for States to submit applications, and States will set local application deadlines. States may begin forwarding applications to us immediately upon Notice of Availability of Funds and must forward all applications not later than the date set by the Regional Administrator. States must provide to us the information described below in paragraph (c) of this section for each property proposed for acquisition or elevation in support of the supplemental allocation requested and within the timeframe that we establish. We will verify project eligibility estimates provided by States in order to assure that all projects meet the criteria for the supplemental grant awards. We will perform an independent verification of this information for not less than 50 percent of the properties submitted.

###### Format.

(c)The State will forward its application to the Regional Administrator. The Application will include: a Standard Form (SF) 424, Application for Federal Assistance; FEMA form 20-15, Budget Information-Construction Programs; Project Narrative (section 209.8(c)-community project applications (buyout plans) selected by the State); FEMA form 20-16, 20-16b and 20-16c Assurances and Certifications; Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities; FEMA form 20-10, Financial Status Report; the Performance/Progress Report format; and the State's certification that the State has reviewed all applications and that they meet program eligibility criteria. The Project Narrative (community project applications) will include:

(1) Community applicant information, including contact names and numbers;

(2) Description of the problem addressed by the proposed project;

(3) Description of the applicant's decision-making process, including alternatives considered;

(4) Project description, including property locations/addresses and scope of activities;

(5) Project cost estimate and match source;

(ix) The estimated pre-event fair market value of the home. Applicants will estimate the value of properties using the best available information, such as inspections, public records and market values of similar properties in similar neighborhoods to arrive at a pre-event fair market value that reflects what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller had the disaster not occurred. If tax assessment data are used as the basis, the applicant should add the relevant adjustment percentage for that jurisdiction to adjust the tax assessment to the current fair market value. These adjustment data should be obtained from the jurisdiction's tax assessor's office. For any jurisdictions where the adjustment factor is over 25 percent, applicants should include a justification for the high adjustment factor. Applicants should not include any other project costs in the property values. These costs will be reflected elsewhere;

(x) Indication whether flood insurance was in force at the time of the loss, and policy number, if available.

##### § 209.9 Appeals.

The State may appeal any decision that we make regarding projects submitted for funding in the Supplemental Property Acquisition and Elevation Assistance program. The State must submit the appeal in writing to the Regional Administrator and must include documentation that justifies the request for reconsideration. The appeal must specify the monetary figure in dispute and the provisions in Federal law, regulation, or policy with which the appellant believes the initial action was inconsistent. The applicant must appeal within 60 days of the applicant's receipt of our funding decision. The State must forward any appeal from an applicant or subgrantee with a written recommendation to the Regional Administrator within 60 days of receipt. Within 90 days following the receipt of an appeal, the Regional Administrator will notify the State in writing as to the new decision or the need for more information.

##### § 209.10 Project implementation requirements.

Subgrantees must enter into an agreement with the State, with the written concurrence of the Regional Administrator, that provides the following assurances:

(a) The subgrantee will administer the grant and implement the project in accordance with program requirements, 44 CFR part 13, the grant agreement, and with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

(b) The State and subgrantee will administer the grant in an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination on the grounds or race, color, religion nationality, sex, age, or economic status in compliance with section 308 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5151) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In implementing the grant, the State and the subgrantee will ensure that no discrimination is practiced.

(c) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects involving alterations to existing structures comply with all applicable State and local codes.

(d) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects comply with applicable State and local floodplain management requirements. Structures will be elevated to the Base Flood Elevation.

(e) Property owners participating in acquisition projects may receive assistance up to the pre-event fair market value of their real property, except as limited by the eligibility criteria.

(f) The subgrantee will establish a process, which we must approve, whereby property owners participating in acquisition projects may request a review of the appraisal for their property, or request a second appraisal.

(g) The State will reduce buyout assistance by any duplication of benefits from other sources. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, payments made to the homeowner for repair assistance; insurance settlements; legal settlements; Small Business Administration loans; and any other payments made by any source to address the property loss unless the property owner can provide receipts showing that the benefits were used for their intended purpose to make repairs to the property.

(h) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage benefits under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may be used to match elevation or acquisition and relocation projects. Increased Cost of Compliance claims can only be used for NFIP-approved costs; these can then be applied to the project grant match. This coverage does not pay for property acquisition, but can pay demolition or structure relocation.

(i) The following restrictive covenants must be conveyed in the deed to any property acquired, accepted, or from which structures are removed ("the property"):

(1) The property must be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices; and

(2) No new structure(s) will be built on the property except as indicated in this paragraph:

(A) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;

(B) A public rest room; or

(C) A structure that is compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management usage and proper floodplain management policies and practices, which the Administrator of FEMA approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.

(D) In general, allowable open space, recreational, and wetland management uses include parks for outdoor recreational activities, nature reserves, cultivation, grazing, camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation), temporary storage in the open of wheeled vehicles that are easily movable (except mobile homes), unimproved, permeable parking lots and buffer zones. Allowable uses generally do not include walled buildings, flood reduction levees, highways or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.

(3) After completing the acquisition project, no application for future disaster assistance will be made for any purpose with respect to the property to any Federal entity or source, and no Federal entity or source will provide such assistance, even for the allowable uses of the property described above.

(4) Any structures built on the property according to paragraph (i)(2) of this section, must be: Located to minimize the potential for flood damage; floodproofed; or elevated to the Base Flood Elevation plus one foot of freeboard.

(5) The subgrantee or other public property owner will seek the approval of the State grantee agency and our Regional Administrator before conveying any interest in the property to any other party. The subgrantee or other public entity or qualified private nonprofit organization must retain all development rights to the property. Our Regional Administrator will only approve the transfer of properties that meet the criteria identified in this paragraph.

(6) In order to carry out tasks associated with monitoring, we, the subgrantee, or the State have the right to enter the parcel, with notice to the parcel owner, to ensure compliance with land use restrictions. Subgrantees may identify the open space nature of the property on local tax maps to assist with monitoring. Whether the subgrantee obtains full title or a conservation easement on the parcel, the State must work with subgrantees to ensure that the parcel owner maintains the property in accordance with land use restrictions. Specifically, the State may:

(i) Monitor and inspect the parcel every two years and certify that the owner continues to use the inspected parcel for open space or agricultural purposes; and

(ii) Take measures to bring a non-compliant parcel back into compliance within 60 days of notice.

(7) Only as a last resort, we reserve the right to require the subgrantee to bring the property back into compliance and transfer the title and easement to a qualified third party for future maintenance.

(8) Every 2 years on October 1st, the subgrantee will report to the State, certifying that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of the agreement. The State will report the certification to us.

##### § 209.11 Grant administration.

###### Cost share.

(a)We may contribute up to 75 percent of the total eligible costs. The State must ensure that non-Federal sources contribute not less than 25 percent of the total eligible costs for the grant. The State or any subgrantee cannot use funds that we provide under this Act as the non-Federal match for other Federal funds nor can the State or any subgrantee use other Federal funds as the required non-Federal match for these funds, except as provided by statute.

###### Allowable costs.

(b)A State may find guidance on allowable costs for States and subgrantees in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-87 and A-122 on Cost Principles. States may use up to 7 percent of the grant funds for management costs of the grant. The State should include management costs in its application. Subgrantees must include reasonable costs to administer the grant as a direct project cost in their budget.

###### Progress reports.

(c)The State must provide a quarterly progress report to us under 44 CFR 13.40, indicating the status and completion date for each project funded. The report will include any problems or circumstances affecting completion dates, scope of work, or project costs that may result in noncompliance with the approved grant conditions.

###### Financial reports.

(d)The State must provide a quarterly financial report to us under 44 CFR 13.41.

###### SMARTLINK Drawdowns.

(e)The State will make SMARTLINK drawdowns to reimburse or advance allowable costs to subgrantees for approved projects.

###### Audit requirements.

(f)Uniform audit requirements as set forth in 44 CFR part 13 apply to all grant assistance provided under this subpart. We may elect to conduct a Federal audit on the disaster assistance grant or on any of the subgrants.

(g) If a mitigation measure is not completed, and there is not adequate justification for non-completion, no Federal funding will be provided for that project.

##### § 209.12 Oversight and results.

###### FEMA oversight.

(a)Our Regional Administrators are responsible for overseeing this grant authority and for ensuring that States and subgrantees meet all program requirements. Regional Administrators will review program progress quarterly.

###### Monitoring and enforcement.

(b)We, subgrantees, and States will monitor the properties purchased under this authority and ensure that the properties are maintained in open space use. We and the State may enforce the agreement by taking any measures that we or they deem appropriate.

###### Program results.

(c)The State will review the effectiveness of approved projects after each future flood event in the affected area to monitor whether projects are resulting in expected savings. The State will report to us on program effectiveness after project completion and after each subsequent flood event.

#### PARTS 210-294 [RESERVED]

### Subchapter E - Fire Assistance

#### PART 295 - CERRO GRANDE FIRE ASSISTANCE

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 295.1 Purpose.

This part implements the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act (CGFAA), Public Law 106-246, 114 Stat. 584, which requires that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) establish a process to evaluate, process and pay claims injuries and property damage resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire.

###### § 295.2 Policy.

It is our policy to provide for the expeditious resolution of meritorious claims through a process that is administered with sensitivity to the burdens placed upon Claimants by the Cerro Grande Fire.

###### § 295.3 Information and assistance.

####### http://www.fema.gov/cerrogrande.

Information and assistance concerning the CGFAA is available from the Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims (OCGFC), Federal Emergency Management Agency, P.O. Box 1480, Los Alamos, New Mexico, 87544-1480, or telephone 1-888-748-1853 (toll free). The Cerro Grande Fire Assistance site on the World Wide Web can be accessed atIn the interest of brevity, we do not restate the provisions of the CGFAA in most instances. Our website has a copy of the CGFAA and we will provide a copy upon request.

###### § 295.4 Organization of this part 295.

This part contains six subparts. Subpart A provides an overview of the CGFAA process. Subpart B describes the procedures for bringing a claim. Subpart C explains what compensation is available. Subpart D discusses the claims evaluation process. Subpart E explains the dispute resolution process. Subpart F contains a glossary in which various terms used in the rule are defined.

###### § 295.5 Overview of the claims process.

(a) The CGFAA is intended to provide persons who suffered losses from the Cerro Grande Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek redress from the United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. In order to obtain benefits under this legislation, a person must submit all Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States to FEMA. A person who elects to proceed under the CGFAA is barred from bringing a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or filing a civil action against the United States for damages resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire. Judicial review of our decisions under the CGFAA is available.

(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with OCGFC. OCGFC will provide the Claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and the claim number.

(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the Claimant to review the claim. The Claims Reviewer will help the Claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the Claimant of his or her responsibility for establishing all elements of the Loss and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Cerro Grande Fire caused the Loss. After the Claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the Claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.

(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the Claimant. The Claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's Determination. If the Claimant is satisfied with the decision payment will be made after the Claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's Determination an Administrative Appeal may be filed with the Director of OCGFC. If the Claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.

###### § 295.6 Partial payments.

OCGFC, on its own initiative, or in response to a request by a Claimant, may make one or more partial payments on the claim. A partial payment can be made if OCGFC has a reasonable basis to estimate the Claimant's damages. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a Claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's Determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the CGFAA. Partial payment decisions cannot be appealed.

###### § 295.7 Authority to settle or compromise claims.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, the Director of OCGFC may extend an offer to settle or compromise a claim or any portion of a claim, which if accepted by the Claimant will be binding on the Claimant and on the United States, except that the United States may recover funds improperly paid to a Claimant due to fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the Claimant or the Claimant's representative, a material mistake on our part or the Claimant's failure to cooperate in an audit as required by § 295.35.

##### Subpart B - Bringing a Claim Under the CGFAA

###### § 295.10 Bringing a claim under the CGFAA.

(a) Any Injured Person may bring a claim under the CGFAA by filing a Notice of Loss. A claim submitted on any form other than a Notice of Loss will not be accepted. The Claimant must provide a brief description of each Loss on the Notice of Loss.

(b) A single Notice of Loss may be submitted on behalf of a Household containing Injured Persons provided that all Injured Persons on whose behalf the claim is presented are identified.

(c) The Notice of Loss must be signed by each Claimant, if the Claimant is an individual or by a duly authorized legal representative of each Claimant, if the Claimant is an entity or an individual who lacks the legal capacity to sign the Notice of Loss. If one is signing a Notice of Loss as the legal representative of a Claimant, the signer must disclose his or her relationship to the Claimant. FEMA may require a legal representative to submit evidence of authority.

####### http://www.fema.gov/cerrogrande.

(d) Notice of Loss forms are available from OCGFC by request. They may be obtained through the mail, in person at the OCGFC office or by telephone request. The Notice of Loss form can also be downloaded from the Internet at

(e) Notices of Loss may be filed with OCGFC by mail to P.O. Box 1480, Los Alamos, NM 87544-1480. OCGFC is unable to accept Notices of Loss submitted by facsimile or e-mail.

(f) A Notice of Loss that is completely filled out and properly signed is deemed to be filed on the date it is received by OCGFC.

###### § 295.11 Deadline for notifying FEMA of losses.

The deadline for filing a Notice of Loss is August 28, 2002. Except as provided in § 295.21(d) with respect to mitigation and in § 295.31(b) with respect to the lump sum payment described therein, a Loss that has not been described: on a Notice of Loss, on a supplement to a Notice of Loss or a request to supplement a Notice of Loss under § 295.33, or a request to reopen a claim under § 295.34, received by OCGFC on or before August 28, 2002 cannot be compensated under the CGFAA. The CGFAA establishes this deadline and does not provide any extensions of the filing deadline.

###### § 295.12 Election of remedies.

(a) By filing a Notice of Loss, an Injured Person waives the right to seek redress for Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States through the Federal Tort Claims Act or by filing a civil action authorized by any other provision of law.

(b) An Injured Person who files a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or who initiates a civil action against the United States or any officer, employee or agent of the United States relating to the Cerro Grande Fire on or after August 28, 2000 is not eligible under the CGFAA to file a Notice of Loss.

(c) An Injured Person who filed before August 28, 2000 a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or a civil action against the United States for injuries, losses or damages relating to the Cerro Grande Fire may file a Notice of Loss provided that the Federal Tort Claims Act claim is withdrawn or the Injured Person is dismissed as a party to the civil action with prejudice not later than October 27, 2000. The withdrawal of a Federal Tort Claims Act claim must be in the form of a signed, written statement on a form provided by OCGFC that is filed with OCGFC not later than October 27, 2000. OCGFC will promptly forward the original notice of withdrawal to the applicable federal agency and retain a copy in the Claimant's file.

###### § 295.13 Subrogation.

An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who has compensated an Injured Person for Cerro Grande Fire related losses, may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss under the CGFAA for the subrogated claim. An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Party who received payment from the insurer or third party filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss may not be filed until the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Cerro Grande Fire related losses under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee and the Injured Person. By filing a Subrogation Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the insurer or third party elects the CGFAA as its exclusive remedy against the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Cerro Grande Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Subrogation Notice of Loss form furnished by OCGFC. FEMA will evaluate subrogation claims on their merits. FEMA may reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for reasonable payments made to an Injured Party on or before October 25, 2000, which exceeded or were not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation. FEMA will not reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for payments made to an Injured Party after October 25, 2000 that exceeded or are not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation.

###### § 295.14 Assignments.

Assignment of claims and the right to receive compensation for claims under the CGFAA is prohibited and will not be recognized by FEMA.

##### Subpart C - Compensation Available Under the CGFAA

###### § 295.20 Prerequisite to compensation.

In order to receive compensation under the CGFAA a Claimant must be an Injured Person who suffered a Loss as a result of the Cerro Grande Fire and sustained damages.

###### § 295.21 Allowable compensation.

####### Allowable compensation.

(a)The CGFAA provides for the payment of compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are "real, substantial and just money damages established by the Claimant in compensation for actual or real injury or loss." In general, an Injured Person will be compensated for Losses to the same extent that the plaintiff in a successful tort action brought against a private party under the laws of the State of New Mexico would be compensated. In addition the CGFAA permits FEMA to compensate Injured Parties for certain categories of "loss of property," "business loss," and "financial loss," which are enumerated in the CGFAA. Damages must be reasonable in amount. Claimants must take reasonable steps to mitigate (reduce) their damages, if possible, as required by New Mexico tort law.

####### Exclusions.

(b)Except as otherwise provided in the CGFAA, a Claimant will not receive compensation for any injury or damage that is not compensable under the Federal Tort Claims Act and New Mexico law. Punitive damages, statutory damages under § 30-32-4 of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated (1978), interest on claims, attorney's fees and agents' fees incurred in prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA or an insurance policy, adjusting costs incurred by an insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, and taxes that may be owed by a Claimant as a consequence of receiving an award are not recoverable from FEMA. The cost to a Claimant of prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA does not constitute compensatory damages and is not recoverable from FEMA, except as provided in § 295.31(b).

####### Damages arising in the future.

(c)In the event that a lump sum payment is awarded to a Claimant for future damages the amount of the payment will be Discounted to Present Value.

Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, to corroborate the nature, extent and value of their losses and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by OCGFC. FEMA may compensate a Claimant for a Loss in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the Claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the loss is not reasonably available.

These deadlines may be extended at the discretion of the Director of OCGFC for good cause. If a non-subrogation Claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of OCGFC, OCGFC may administratively close the claim and require the Claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation Claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss.

###### § 295.34 Reopening a claim.

(a) The Director of OCGFC may reopen a claim if requested to do so by the Claimant, notwithstanding the submission of the Release and Certification Form, for the limited purpose of considering issues raised by the request to reopen if:

###### § 296.5 Overview of the claims process.

(a) The Act is intended to provide persons who suffered Injury from the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek compensation from the United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. To obtain compensation under the Act, an Injured Person must submit all Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related claims against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States to the FEMA Claims Office. An Injured Person who elects to accept an award under the Act is barred from accepting an award pursuant to a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or a civil action against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States arising out of or relating to the same subject matter. Judicial review of FEMA decisions under the Act is available.

(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with the Claims Office. The Claims Office will provide the claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and a claim number.

(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the claimant to review the claim. Claims Reviewer will help the claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the claimant of their responsibility for establishing all elements of the injuries and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire caused the injuries. After the claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.

(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the claimant. The claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's determination. If the claimant is satisfied with the decision, payment will be made after the claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's determination, an administrative appeal may be filed with the Director of the Claims Office. If the claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.

##### Subpart B - Bringing a Claim Under the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act

###### § 296.10 Filing a claim under the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act.

(b) A single Notice of Loss may be submitted on behalf of a household containing Injured Persons provided that all Injured Persons on whose behalf the claim is presented are identified.

(c) The Notice of Loss must be signed by each claimant, if the claimant is an individual, or by a duly authorized legal representative of each claimant, if the claimant is an entity or an individual who lacks the legal capacity to sign the Notice of Loss. If one is signing a Notice of Loss as the legal representative of a claimant, the signer must disclose their relationship to the claimant. FEMA may require a legal representative to submit evidence of their authority to act.

Except as provided in § 296.35 with respect to a request to reopen a claim, an injury that has not been described: on a Notice of Loss, on a supplement to a Notice of Loss or a request to supplement a Notice of Loss under § 296.34 received by the Claims Office on or before November 14, 2024 cannot be compensated under the Act. The Act establishes this deadline and does not provide any extensions of the filing deadline.

###### § 296.12 Election of remedies.

(a) An Injured Person who accepts an award under the Act waives the right to pursue all claims for injuries arising out of or relating to the same subject matter against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States through the Federal Tort Claims Act or a civil action authorized by any other provision of law.

(b) An Injured Person who accepts an award through a Federal Tort Claims Act claim or a civil action against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States relating to the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire waives the right to pursue any claim arising out of or relating to the same subject matter under the Act.

###### § 296.13 Subrogation.

An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who has compensated an injured person for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries, may file a Notice of Loss under the Act for the subrogated claim. A subrogee may file a Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Person who received payment from the subrogee filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss should be filed after the subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the subrogee and the Injured Person, but not later than November 14, 2024. By filing a Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the subrogee elects the Act as its exclusive remedy against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire.

A claimant may submit for the Administrative Record a statement explaining why the claimant believes that the injuries and damages are compensable and any documentary evidence supporting the claim. Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, including photographs and video, to corroborate the nature, extent, and value of their injuries and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by the Claims Office. FEMA may compensate a claimant for an injury in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the injury is not reasonably available. FEMA may also require an inspection of real property. FEMA may request that a business claimant execute an affidavit, which states that the claimant will provide documentary evidence, including but not limited to income tax returns, if requested by the DHS Office of the Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office during an audit of the claim.

The Proof of Loss must be signed under penalty of perjury. Non-subrogation claimants should submit a signed Proof of Loss to the Claims Office not later than 150 days after the date when the Notice of Loss was submitted. This deadline may be extended at the discretion of the Director of the Claims Office for good cause. If a non-subrogation claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of the Claims Office, the Claims Office may administratively close the claim and require the claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss.

####### Release and Certification Form.

(c)All claimants who receive compensation under the Act are required to sign a Release and Certification Form, including for partial payments under § 296.33. The Release and Certification Form must be executed by the claimant or the claimant's legal representative if the claimant is an entity or lacks the legal capacity to execute the Release and Certification Form. A Release and Certification Form must be received by the Claims Office before the Claims Office provides payment on the claim. The United States will not attempt to recover compensatory damages paid to a claimant who has executed and returned a Release and Certification Form within the periods provided above, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the claimant or the claimant's representative, failure of the claimant to cooperate with an audit as required by § 296.36 or a material mistake by FEMA.

####### Authority to settle or compromise claims.

(d)Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Director of the Claims Office may extend an offer to settle or compromise a claim or any portion of a claim at any time during the process outlined in this part, which if accepted by the claimant will be binding on the claimant and on the United States, except that the United States may recover funds improperly paid to a claimant due to fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the claimant or the claimant's representative, a material mistake on FEMA's part or the claimant's failure to cooperate in an audit as required by § 296.36.

###### § 296.31 Reimbursement of claim expenses.

(a) FEMA will reimburse claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in providing documentation requested by the Claims Office.

(b) FEMA will provide a lump sum payment for incidental expenses incurred in claims preparation to claimants that are awarded compensatory damages under the Act after a properly executed Release and Certification Form has been returned to the Claims Office. The amount of the lump sum payment will be the greater of $150 or 5% of the Act's compensatory damages and insurance proceeds recovered by the claimant for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries (not including the lump sum payment or monies reimbursed under the Act for the purchase of flood insurance) but will not exceed $25,000. Subrogation claimants and claimants whose only Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related loss is for flood insurance premiums will not be eligible.

###### § 296.32 Determination of compensation due to claimant.

####### Authorized Official's report.

(a)After the Claims Office has evaluated all elements of a claim as stated in the Proof of Loss, the Authorized Official will issue, and provide the claimant with a copy of, the Authorized Official's determination.

####### Claimant's options upon issuance of the Authorized Official's determination.

(b)Not later than 120 days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's determination, the claimant must either accept the determination by submitting a Release and Certification Form to FEMA and/or initiate an Administrative Appeal in accordance with § 296.41. Claimants must sign the Release and Certification Form to receive payment on their claims (including for partial payments). The claimant will receive payment of compensation awarded by the Authorized Official after FEMA receives the completed Release and Certification Form. If the claimant does not either submit a Release and Certification Form to FEMA or initiate an Administrative Appeal no later than 120 days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's determination, the claimant will be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Authorized Official's determination. The Director of the Claims Office may modify the deadlines set forth in this subsection at the request of a claimant for good cause shown.

###### § 296.33 Partial payments.

The Claims Office at the request of a claimant may make one or more partial payments on any aspect of a claim that is severable. Receipt by a claimant of a partial payment is contingent on the claimant signing a Release and Certification Form for the severable part of the claim for which partial payment is being made. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the Act with respect to any portion of a claim for which a Release and Certification Form has not been executed. The Claims Office decision on whether to provide a partial payment cannot be appealed.

###### § 296.34 Supplementing claims.

A claimant may amend the Notice of Loss to include additional claims at any time before signing a Proof of Loss. After the claimant has submitted a Proof of Loss and before submission of a Release and Certification Form, a claimant may request that the Director of the Claims Office consider one or more injuries not addressed in the Proof of Loss. The request must be submitted in writing to the Director of the Claims Office and received not later than the deadline for filing an Administrative Appeal under § 296.32 or November 14, 2024, whichever is earlier. It must be supported by the claimant's explanation of why the injury was not previously reported. If good cause is found to consider the additional injury, the Director will determine whether compensation is due to the claimant for the Loss under the Administrative Appeal procedures described in § 296.41.

###### § 296.35 Reopening a claim.

The Director of the Claims Office may reopen a claim if requested to do so by the claimant, notwithstanding the submission of the Release and Certification Form, for the limited purpose of considering issues raised by the request to reopen if, not later than November 14, 2025, the claimant desires heightened risk reduction compensation in accordance with § 296.21(e)(5); the claimant closed the sale of a home and wishes to present a claim for decrease in the value of the real property under § 296.21(c)(3); the claimant has incurred additional losses under § 296.21(c)(1) as part of a reconstruction in excess of those previously awarded; or the Director of the Claims Office otherwise determines that claimant has demonstrated good cause.

###### § 296.36 Access to records.

For purpose of audit and investigation, a claimant will grant the DHS Office of the Inspector General and the Comptroller General of the United States access to any property that is the subject of a claim and to any and all books, documents, papers, and records (including any relevant tax records) maintained by a claimant or under the claimant's control pertaining or relevant to the claim.

###### § 296.37 Confidentiality of information.

Confidential information submitted by individual claimants is protected from disclosure to the extent permitted by the Privacy Act. These protections are described in the Privacy Act Notice provided with the Notice of Loss. Other claimants should consult with FEMA concerning the availability of confidentiality protection under exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act and other applicable laws before submitting confidential, proprietary or trade secret information.

The State and local jurisdiction (if applicable) will be notified in writing of the Administrator's decision, including a statement of the reasons therefor.

##### § 302.4 Merit personnel systems.

###### Background.

(a)Section 208 of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4728) authorizes Federal agencies to require, as a condition of participation in Federal assistance programs, systems of a personnel administration consistent with personnel standards prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has promulgated Standards for a System of Personnel Administration (5 CFR part 900) which prescribe intergovernmental personnel standards on a merit basis as a condition of eligibility in the administration of grant programs. OPM has approved FEMA adoption of these standards by the regulations in this part.

###### Standard.

(b)Participation by each grantee and each subgrantee under the program covered in this part is subject to compliance with the following conditions regarding merit personnel systems:

##### § 302.5 Allocations and reallocations.

(a) The Administrator shall allocate the entire amount of funds available for the purposes of this program from the appropriation for each fiscal year. The allocation made to each State represents the total amount of funds available to pay the Federal share of necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative expenses of the State and its participating subdivisions during the fiscal year.

(b) The first calculation for developing the allocation for each State will be a formula distribution in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act, made by applying the following percentages to the total sum of Emergency Management Assistance in the President's budget request to Congress:

(1) Fifty (50) percent will be allocated on the basis of the prior-year State allocations, in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to give due regard to "the relative state of development of civil defense readiness of the State" (State and local levels).

(2) Thirty-three (33) percent will be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the State's population to the national population (50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), in fulfilment of the statutory requirements to give due regard to "population" and to "the criticality of target and support areas and the areas which may be affected by natural disasters with respect to the development of the total civil defense readiness of the Nation."

(3) Fifteen (15) percent will be divided equally among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

(4) In consonance with the statutory provision allowing the Administrator to prescribe other factors concerning the State allocations, the remaining two (2) percent will be held temporarily in reserve, to be used first to fund the four territories of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Conditions peculiar to those areas make strict application of the mathematical formula in § 302.5(b) inequitable. Therefore, the Administrator will consider prior-year allocations, percentage of total United States population, and the factors set out in § 302.5(e) (1), (2), (4), and (5) in determining their allocations. The remaining balance of the reserve fund will then be used to restore any State which would receive less by formula share than its formula share for the previous fiscal year, provided that the reserve balance is sufficient to do this for all such States. Any remaining balance after this has been done will constitute a supplemental fund from which the Administrator will consider State requests for additional funding and the needs of any interstate civil defense authorities.

(c) For initial planning purposes only, each State will then be informed of the figure by the Regional Administrator. The State will base its initial EMA application upon that figure but may request a smaller amount or with appropriate justification a larger amount.

(d) The amount requested by the State shall not exceed 50 percent of its estimate of necessary and essential State and local personnel and administrative expenses for the fiscal year.

(e) The formula distribution shall be reviewed and evaluated, and adjusted as appropriate, by the Administrator, based on the current situation in each State, the requests of all States, and recommendations by the Regional Administrators. The Administrator will consider the following five factors:

(1) The ability of the State and its subgrantees to effectively expend such an amount for necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative purposes. Past performance is a factor in this determination.

(2) Special circumstances existing in the State at the time of allocating which require unusual expenditures for civil defense.

(3) Conditions peculiar to the State which make strict application of mathematical formula inequitable either to that State or other States.

(4) The relative cost of civil defense personnel and administrative services in that State; that is, whether such costs are considerably above or below the national average for similar services and expenses.

(5) Substantial changes in the civil defense readiness of the State not reflected by its recent civil defense expenditures.

(f) In September of each year, based on applications received and recommendations by the Regional Administrators, the Administrator will make a tentative allocation to the States. This will include adjustments for States that have indicated they will not be using the total of the formula distribution amount. States can then revise their earlier plans and applications to more nearly reflect the level of funding expected to become available.

(g) A State may provide to the Regional Administrator a preliminary annual submission in an amount not to exceed its tentative allocation.

(h) By September 30 (or as soon thereafter as feasible), the Administrator will make a formal allocation based on, or subject to, appropriation by Congress and allotment of the funds. This allocation for each State may include any additional amounts from the reserve portion of the EMA funds, and shall be in accordance with the regulations in this part and CPG 1-3.

(i) Upon the appropriation becoming available, and if requested by a State, the Regional Administrator may approve such State's preliminary annual submission (if found to meet all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3) in an appropriate amount which does not exceed the amount of the State's share of the Administrator's formal allocation of the Federal appropriation. An award document obligating Federal funds on the basis of the approved preliminary annual submission may be executed in accordance with the provisions of CPG 1-3.

(j) Based on and within 60 days after notification of its formal allocation, each State must provide to the Regional Administrator a final annual submission which meets all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3. If no changes are necessary, a State and the Regional Administrator may adopt in writing the State's preliminary annual submission as its final annual submission. If no award document was executed based on a State's preliminary annual submission, such document will be executed on the basis of that State's approved final annual submission.

(k) With regard to any State whose award document was executed pursuant to a preliminary annual submission covering only part of its formal allocation, upon approval (by the Regional Administrator) of the final annual submission (including a revised statement of work supporting the additional funding request) the Regional Administrator shall execute an amended award document obligating the balance of such State's formal allocation.

(l) After being advised of its annual formal allocation, if a State fails to submit, within 60 days, an approvable annual submission in the amount of its allocation, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the unused portion to other States in the region in such amounts as in his/her judgment will best assure adequate development of the civil defense capability of the Nation. The exception to this authority is in the event a State, or local jurisdiction, refuses to participate in attack preparedness activities. EMA funds withheld or returned for that reason are to be released to headquarters for reallocation on a national basis. In addition, the Regional Administrator may from time to time reallocate the amounts released by a State from its allocation as no longer being required for utilization in accordance with an approved annual submission and award document.

(m) Immediate notice to the headquarters EMA Program Manager of State reallocations is required in the form of copies of EMA-approved Annual Submission amendment documents, accompanied by copies of assistance award/amendment documents signed by regional and State authorized officials of both the releasing and recipient States.

(n) There is no dollar ceiling on the amount of funds that may be reallocated among States in a region. However, at any time that there are funds surplus to the eligible needs of the States within a region, those funds should be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation to other States with unfunded additional requirements.

(o) On July 1 of each fiscal year, the authority to reallocate EMA funds shall revert to the Administrator. In addition, any excess EMA funds available on that date, or that become available during the remainder of the fiscal year, are to be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation by the Administrator.

##### § 302.6 Fiscal year limitation.

Federal appropriations for the program covered by the regulations in this part are limited for obligation on a Federal fiscal year basis. Each annual submission (or amendment thereto) which results in a change in scope (e.g., an increase in the amount of funds other than a cost overrun) must be approved during the Federal Fiscal year for which the funds to be charged were appropriated. Valid expenses incurred by a State or its subgrantee during the fiscal year but before obligation by FEMA of funds under this program may qualify for payment of a Federal financial contribution out of the funds subsequently appropriated for that fiscal year.

##### § 302.7 Use of funds, materials, supplies, equipment, and personnel.

Financial contributions provided under the authority of section 205 of the Act are provided for necessary and essential State and local civil defense personnel and administrative expenses as prescribed by the regulations in this part and the provisions of CPG 1-3, and are obligated only on the basis of documentation justifying such need.

###### Emergencies.

(a)In addition to such civil defense use, Federal funds obligated under a grantee's approved annual submission may be used, to the extent and under such terms and conditions as prescribed by the Administrator in CPG 1-3, for providing emergency assistance, including the use of civil defense personnel, organizational equipment, materials, and facilities, in preparation for and response to actual attack-related events or natural disasters (including manmade catastrophies).

###### Limitations.

(b)Section 207 of the Act allows use of funds under the Act, including those for this program, for natural (including manmade) disaster preparedness and response purposes only to the extent that such use is consistent with, contributes to, and does not detract from attack-related preparedness (reference 44 CFR part 312).

##### § 302.8 Waiver of "single" State agency requirements.

###### et seq.

Section 205 of the Act requires that plans for civil defense of the United States be administered or supervised by a single State agency (50 U.S.C. App. 2286). Notwithstanding such law, section 204 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4214) provides authority for the Administrator as head of the grantor agency, upon the State's request, to waive the single State agency requirement and to approve other State administrative structure or arrangements, upon adequate showing that the requirement prevents the establishment of the most effective and efficient organizational arrangements within the State government. First, however, the Administrator must have found that the objectives of the Act (50 U.S.C. app. 2251) will not be endangered by the use of such other State structure or arrangements. Attachment D of OMB Circular A-102 requires that such requests be given expeditious handling by the grantor agency and that, whenever possible, an affirmative response be made.

#### PARTS 313-320 [RESERVED]

#### PART 321 - MAINTENANCE OF THE MOBILIZATION BASE (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, MARITIME ADMINISTRATION)

##### § 321.1 General.

A sustained state of mobilization production readiness is necessary to place the United States in a defense posture which will enable the nation to defend itself against aggression in peripheral conflicts or general war involving nuclear attacks on this country. Therefore, the facilities, machine tools, production equipment, and skilled workers necessary to produce the wartime requirements of the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration shall be maintained in a state of readiness which will facilitate their immediate use or conversion in time of emergency, with especial emphasis on measures to maximize the probability of continued post-attack production of those items judged to be vital to survival and victory.

##### § 321.2 Selection of the mobilization base.

(a) The Department of Defense shall select, for its mobilization base, facilities which produce or are capable of producing critically important military items or components (military class A components used entirely in the production, maintenance, or repair of military items) which meet one of the following:

(1) Those items which would be so urgent to the defense of this country that utmost effort must be exerted to produce them even in case of general war involving severe damage to the facilities necessary to produce these items and the components thereof.

(2) Those items essential to survival and retaliation, maintenance of health, or combat efficiency required to support peripheral war and which meet one or more of the following criteria:

(i) Items requiring a long lead-time or long manufacturing cycle.

(ii) Items currently not in production or which are required in quantities far in excess of peacetime production.

(iii) Items requiring the conversion of an industry or a number of plants within an industry.

(iv) Items requiring materials or manufacturing processes essentially different from those in current use.

(v) Items for which industry does not have production experience.

(b) In selecting facilities for the Department of Defense mobilization base, consideration shall be given to their vulnerability to nuclear attack, with particular attention to the possibility of (1) minimizing vulnerability of facilities producing "urgent" items under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including the need for dispersal, protective construction, and special security measures to safeguard against sabotage of clandestine attack, and (2) reducing concentration of uncommon critical production facilities so that a productive segment of each critical industry would be likely to survive a nuclear attack.

(c) The Department of Energy and the Maritime Administration, in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall determine the items and facilities which meet the above criteria for their respective programs for maintaining the mobilization base.

##### § 321.3 Maintaining the mobilization base.

(a) Facilities selected to produce "urgent" items shall be maintained within limits of existing procurement authority and funds available by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration in the following manners to the maximum practical degree:

(1) Current procurement shall be placed in these facilities to the extent which will maintain them in a state of readiness compatible with the plans of the procuring agency.

(2) Machine tools and production equipment will be installed in these facilities to the extent found necessary by the procuring agency.

(3) Develop and maintain plans for alternate production capacity in case disaster destroys current facilities, such capacity to be located to the maximum extent possible away from highly concentrated industrial areas and major military installations.

(b) Other facilities selected as part of the mobilization base, shall be maintained to the fullest extent possible.

(1) Procurement agencies shall integrate current procurement with their industrial mobilization plans to the greatest possible extent with the objective of supporting the mobilization base within authorities and funds available.

(2) Data assembled on essential mobilization suppliers by the industrial mobilization planning of these agencies shall be used in planning current procurement. The policy of using contractors and facilities essential to the mobilization base is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

(3) Planned producers that are deemed to be a part of the mobilization base will be invited to participate in appropriate current procurement.

(4) Upon expiration of current procurement contracts in a facility, the procuring agency shall take such of the following actions as are compatible with its plans for maintaining a state of readiness:

###### Government-owned facilities and tools.

(i)Within the limitations that may be imposed by Congressional appropriations, place government-owned facilities and tools in standby status and establish provisions for their adequate maintenance. This does not preclude the use of government-owned production equipment, on a loan basis, to enable the military departments to meet current production schedules, as provided in DMO-VII-4, Amendment 1.

###### Privately-owned facilities and government-owned tools.

(ii)(A) Arrange with management of privately-owned facilities, wherever possible, to place government-owned tools and production equipment in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe location.

(B) Arrange with management, on a voluntary basis, to keep a group of key managers, engineers, and skilled workers familiar with the items planned for mobilization production.

(C) Determine the gaps which exist in government-owned packages of tools and production equipment needed to produce mobilization requirements in privately-owned plants. Within the limit of fund availability, plan the procurement of such tools and equipment with priority being given to long lead-time tools and equipment or those not used in general manufacturing. These tools and equipment, when procured, should be placed in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe locations.

(D) Determine which government-owned tools and equipment have become obsolete, or which would not be used in event of mobilization, and plan for their disposal in accordance with the provisions of DMO-VII-4, as amended.

##### § 321.4 Achieving production readiness.

(a) In order to achieve a capability for maximum production of "urgent" items during the initial phase of war, the following readiness measures shall be taken where advisable for facilities producing such items:

(1) Establishment of emergency production schedules.

(2) Development of a production capability which would function under widespread disruption and damage imposed by enemy attack, including, where necessary:

(i) Maintenance of an increased inventory of finished components and related production supplies at assembly plants, or arrangements for alternative supply lines where increased inventories are not feasible.

(ii) A capability to carry on urgent production without dependence on additional personnel, external sources of power, fuel, and water, or on long-distance communications; with spare replacements for highly vulnerable or unreliable parts of production equipment.

(iii) Protection of production facilities from enemy sabotage through adequate physical security measures.

(iv) Protection of personnel from widespread radiological fallout through provisions for decontamination and shelter.

##### § 321.5 Retention of industrial facilities.

(a) Industrial properties, owned by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration, shall be retained in the Industrial reserves (National Industrial Reserve, Departmental Industrial Reserve for the Department of Defense) of the department and agencies to the extent the capacity of said reserves is necessary for the production of defense or defense-supporting end items, materials or components in a mobilization period.

(b) Each idle plant in the reserves shall be reviewed annually by the heads of the respective agencies to determine if the capacity of the plant continues necessary for mobilization purposes.

(c) Upon the determination by the head of the agency that the capacity of a plant is excess to the mobilization requirements of the agency immediate steps will be taken to dispose of the plant through existing government channels for surplus disposal. The Federal Emergency Management Agency shall be informed by General Services Administration of each proposed surplus action prior to final determination.

##### § 321.6 Participation of small business.

The agencies concerned with the order shall, in all of their programs for maintaining the mobilization base, be mindful of the national policy to protect the interests of small business, and to assure the maximum participation of small business in the mobilization base, including current procurement.

##### § 321.7 [Reserved]

##### § 321.8 Reports.

The Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Maritime Administration shall furnish the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with reports on items and facilities for programs under § 321.2 (a) and (b) of this part, and with such other periodic and special reports as he may require affecting the maintenance of the mobilization base.

#### PART 322 [RESERVED]

#### PART 323 - GUIDANCE ON PRIORITY USE OF RESOURCES IN IMMEDIATE POST ATTACK PERIOD (DMO-4)

##### § 323.1 Purpose.

This part:

(a) States the policy of the Federal Government on use of resources in the period immediately following a nuclear attack on the United States;

(b) Provides general guidance for Federal, State, and local government officials on activities to be accorded priority in the use of postattack resources; and

(c) Lists those items essential to national survival in the immediate postattack period.

##### § 323.2 General policy.

(a) In an immediate postattack period all decisions regarding the use of resources will be directed to the objective of national survival and recovery. In order to achieve this objective, postattack resources will be assigned to activities concerned with the maintenance and saving of lives, immediate military defense and retaliatory operations, economic activities essential to continued survival and recovery.

(b) This guidance is designed to achieve a degree of national equity in the use of resources and to assign and conserve resources effectively in the immediate postattack period. Until more specific instructions are available, these are the general guidelines within which managerial judgment and common sense must be used to achieve national objectives under widely differing emergency conditions.

##### § 323.3 Responsibilities.

(a) As stated in The National Plan for Emergency Preparedness, the direction of resources mobilization is a Federal responsibility. However, in the period immediately following an attack, certain geographical areas may be temporarily isolated, and State and local governments will assume responsibility for the use of resources remaining in such areas until effective Federal authority can be restored. State and local governments will not assume responsibility for resources under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency where the Federal agency is able to function.

(b) As soon as possible after an attack and until specific national direction and guidance on the use of resources is provided, Federal, State, and local officials will determine what resources are available, to what needs they can be applied, how they are to be used, and the extent to which resources are deficient or in excess of survival needs. They will base determinations as to the relative urgency for use of resources primarily upon the importance of specific needs of defense, survival, and recovery.

##### § 323.4 Priority activities in immediate postattack period.

The following activities are to be accorded priority over all other claims for resources. There is no significance in the order of the listing-all are important. The order in which and the extent to which they are supported locally may vary with local conditions and circumstances. If local conditions necessitate the establishment of an order of priority among these activities, that order shall be based on determinations of relative urgency among the activities listed, the availability of resources for achieving the actions required, and the feasibility and timeliness of the activities in making the most rapid and effective contribution to national survival.

(a) The immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations of the Armed Forces of the United States and its Allies: This includes support of military personnel and the production and distribution of military and atomic weapons, materials and equipment required to carry out these immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations.

(b) Maintenance or reestablishment of Government authority and control to restore and preserve order and to assure direction of emergency operations essential for the safety and protection of the people. This includes:

(1) Police protection and movement direction;

(2) Fire defense, rescue and debris clearance;

(3) Warnings;

(4) Emergency information and instructions;

(5) Radiological detection, monitoring and decontamination.

(c) Production and distribution of survival items and provision of services essential to continued survival and rapid recovery. (For list of survival items, see appendix 1 to this part.) These include:

(1) Expedient shelter;

(2) Food, including necessary processing and storage;

(3) Feeding, clothing, lodging, and other welfare services;

(4) Emergency housing and community services;

(5) Emergency health services, including medical care, public health and sanitation;

(6) Water, fuel, and power supply;

(7) Emergency repair and restoration of damaged vital facilities.

(d) Essential communications and transportation services needed to carry out the above activities.

(e) Provision of supplies, equipment, and repair parts to produce and distribute goods needed for the above activities.

##### § 323.5 Assignment of resources.

Resources required for essential uses, including manpower, will be assigned to meet the emergency requirements of the priority activities indicated above. The principal objectives are to use available resources to serve essential needs promptly and effectively, and to:

(a) Protect and to prevent waste or dissipation of resources prior to their assignment to priority activities;

(b) Support production of essential goods. Other production will be permitted to continue only from inventories on hand and when there is no emergency requirement for the resources vital to this production.

(c) Support construction for emergency repair and restoration, construction of facilities needed for survival, or the conversion of facilities to survival use, where this can be accomplished quickly. Other construction already under way should be stopped, and no new construction started unless it can be used immediately for essential purposes upon completion.

##### Appendix 1 to Part 323 - List of Essential Survival Items

This document contains a list of items considered essential to sustain life at a productive level to assure national survival in an emergency. The list identifies items to which major attention should be given in all phases of preattack planning to insure the availability of basic essentials for a productive economy in the event of a nuclear attack. Supply-requirements studies and assessments for these items will be made to disclose critical deficiencies or other problems that can be anticipated. Revisions will be made as necessary to keep the items as up-to-date as possible.

The items are arranged by seven major groups:

(1) Health Supplies and Equipment,

(2) Food,

(3) Body Protection and Household Operations,

(4) Electric Power and Fuels,

(5) Sanitation and Water Supply,

(6) Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment, and

(7) General Use Items.

Survival items are defined as "those items without which large segments of the population would die or have their health so seriously impaired as to render them both burdensome and non-productive." The items have been classified into Group A or Group B, with Group A representing end products consumed or used directly by the population, and Group B consisting of those items essential to the effective production and utilization of the Group A items, which are consumed or used directly by the people.

There are no Group B items in the categories of Health Supplies and Equipment, Body Production and Household Operations, and Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment. All of these items are considered to be consumed directly and any attempt to separate them in to A and B groupings would be too arbitrary to be meaningful.

It is important to keep in mind the fact that while the items listed are the basic essentials necessary for maintaining a viable economy during the first six months following an attack, not all of them would create problems that would require government action preattack to insure adequate supplies. The aforementioned supply-requirements studies will be undertaken to identify the problem areas. In developing supply data, all available production capacity, existing inventories, and possible substitutions will be considered. For example, in analyzing clothing items, all available supplies would be considered from sport to dress shirts, from overalls to dress suits. However, new production would be limited to the simplest form of the basic item which can be produced. The final determination as to which of the items are most critical and which may require preattack actions by the Government, as well as the type of actions which must be taken, can be made only after a comprehensive supply-requirements analysis is completed.

#### PART 327 - POLICY ON USE OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED INDUSTRIAL PLANT EQUIPMENT BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY (DMO-10A)

##### § 327.1 Purpose.

This part establishes policy on the use by private industry of Government-owned industrial plant equipment. This policy is necessary to maintain a highly effective and immediately available reserve of such equipment for the emergency preparedness programs of the U.S. Government.

##### § 327.2 Scope and applicability.

(a) This part applies to all Federal departments and agencies having, for purposes of mobilization readiness, Government-owned industrial plant equipment under their jurisdiction or control and having emergency preparedness functions assigned by Executive orders concerning use of that equipment.

###### industrial plant equipment

(b) As used herein,means those items of equipment, each with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, that fall within specified classes of equipment listed in DOD regulations. Classes of equipment may from time to time be added to or deleted from this list.

##### § 327.3 Policy.

###### General.

(a)(1) Primary reliance for defense production shall be placed upon private industry.

#### PART 331 - PRESERVATION OF THE MOBILIZATION BASE THROUGH THE PLACEMENT OF PROCUREMENT AND FACILITIES IN LABOR SURPLUS AREAS

##### § 331.1 Purpose.

Success of the national defense program depends upon efficient use of all of our resources, including the labor force and production facilities, which are preserved through utilizing the skills of both management and labor. A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.

##### § 331.2 Policy.

(a) It is the policy of the Federal Government to award appropriate contracts to eligible labor surplus area concerns, to place production facilities in labor surplus areas, and to make the best use of our natural, industrial and labor resources in order to achieve the following objectives:

(1) To preserve management and employee skills necessary to the fulfillment of Government contracts and purchases;

(2) To maintain productive facilities;

(3) To improve utilization of the Nation's total economic potential by making use of the labor force resources of each area; and

(4) To help ensure timely delivery of required goods and services and to promote readiness for mobilization by locating procurement where the needed labor force and facilities are fully available.

(b) This policy is consonant with the intent of Public Law 95-89 and Public Law 95-507 as implemented by E.O. 12073. In carrying out this policy, Federal departments and agencies shall be guided by E.O. 12073, the policy direction of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and implementing regulations.

##### § 331.3 Scope and applicability.

The provisions of this policy apply to all Federal departments and agencies, except as otherwise prohibited by law. In addition to these normal duties;

(a) The Secretary of Commerce shall:

(1) In cooperation with State economic development agencies, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of Small Business Administration, assist concerns which have agreed to perform contracts in labor surplus areas in obtaining Government procurement business by providing such concerns with timely information on proposed Government procurements.

(2) Urge concerns planning new production facilities to consider the advantages of locating in labor surplus areas.

(3) Provide technical advice and counsel to groups and organizations in labor surplus areas on planning industrial parks, industrial development organizations, expanding tourist business, and available Federal aids.

(b) The Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall make available to small business concerns in labor surplus areas all of its services, endeavor to ensure opportunity for maximum participation by such concerns in Government procurement, and give consideration to the needs of these concerns in the making of joint small business set-asides with Government procurement agencies.

(c) OFPP shall coordinate the maintenance by Federal agencies of current information on the manufacturing capabilities of labor surplus area concerns with respect to Government procurement and disseminate such information to Federal departments and agencies.

##### § 331.4 Special consideration.

When an entire industry that sells a significant proportion of its production to the Government is generally depressed or has a significant proportion of its production, manufacturing and service facilities located in a labor surplus area, the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, or successor in function, after notice to and hearing of interested parties, will give consideration to appropriate measures applicable to the entire industry.

##### § 331.5 Production facilities.

All Federal departments and agencies shall give consideration to labor surplus areas in the selection of sites for Government-financed production facilities, including expansion, to the extent that such selection is consistent with existing law and essential economic and strategic factors.

##### Subpart D - Priorities and Placement of Rated Orders

###### § 333.10 Authority.

(a) The priorities and allocations authorities of the President under Title I of the Act that have been delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security have been redelegated to the Administrator. These rules are issued pursuant to Title I of the Act, and implementing authorities, including such authorities as are contained in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560), which have been delegated to FEMA.

####### Delegations by FEMA.

(b)FEMA may authorize Delegate Agencies to assign priority ratings to orders under these regulations as authorized.

####### Jurisdictional limitations.

(c)Unless delegated by the President to DHS or FEMA, the provisions of this part are not applicable to the following resource categories, as defined in Executive Order 13603, a successor executive order, or implementing regulations issued thereunder:

(1) Food resources, food resource facilities, and the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer (Resource department with jurisdiction-Department of Agriculture);

(2) Energy supplies (Resources agency with jurisdiction-Department of Energy);

(3) All forms of civil transportation (Resource department with jurisdiction-Department of Transportation);

(4) Health resources (Resource department with jurisdiction-Department of Health and Human Services), except that pursuant to Executive Order 13911, the provisions of this part are applicable to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19;

(5) Water resources (Resource department with jurisdiction-Department of Defense); and

(6) All other materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials ("industrial resources") (Resource department with jurisdiction-Department of Commerce).

###### § 333.11 Priority ratings.

####### Levels of priority.

(a)(1) There are two levels of priority established by Federal Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols "DO" and "DX."

(2) All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 333.14(c)).

(3) In addition, a Directive issued by FEMA regarding priority treatment for a given item takes preference over any DX rated order, DO rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see § 333.52).

####### Program identification symbols.

(b)Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. Program identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority.

####### Priority ratings.

(c)A priority rating consists of the rating symbol-DO or DX-and the program identification symbol.

###### § 333.12 Elements of a rated order.

####### Elements required for all rated orders.

(a)(1) The appropriate priority rating and program identification symbol;

(2) A required delivery date or dates. The words "immediately" or "as soon as possible" do not constitute a delivery date. When a "requirements contract," "basic ordering agreement," "prime vendor contract," or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating contains no specific delivery date or dates, but provides for the furnishing of items from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as "calls," "requisitions," and "delivery orders," the purchase orders under such contracts or agreements must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document.

(3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The signature, manual or digital, certifies that the rated order is authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are being followed; and

(4) A statement that reads in substance: "This is a rated order certified for national defense use and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Emergency Management Priorities and Allocations System regulations (44 CFR part 333)."

####### Additional element required for certain emergency preparedness rated orders.

(b)If a rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary or appropriate to meet these requirements, the following statement must be included in the order: "This rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness. It must be accepted or rejected pursuant to the mandatory acceptance and mandatory rejection requirements found in 44 CFR 333.13 within [Insert a time limit no less than the minimum applicable time limit specified in § 333.13(d)(2)]."

####### Additional elements required for rated orders issued by FEMA or a Delegate Agency to facilitate sales to third parties.

(c)If a rated order is placed by FEMA or the Delegate Agency to facilitate a sale to a third party who desires to order the materials, the following statement must also be included in the order: "This rated order is placed for the purpose of facilitating a sale to [Insert third party] to promote the national defense. It must be accepted or rejected pursuant to the mandatory acceptance and mandatory rejection requirements found in 44 CFR 333.13 within [Insert the applicable time limit consistent with § 333.13(d)], and it is subject to the additional requirements of 44 CFR 333.19. [Third party] is responsible for satisfying the applicable terms of sale and payment. The Federal Government is not be liable for any failure to meet the terms of sale or payment. For purposes of these and any other notification requirements set forth in FEMA's Emergency Management Priorities and Allocations System regulations (44 CFR part 333), both [Insert FEMA or Delegate Agency] and [Insert third party] are the `customer.'"

###### § 333.13 Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.

####### Mandatory acceptance.

(a)(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person must accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.

(2) A person must not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.

####### Mandatory rejection.

(b)Unless otherwise directed by FEMA:

(1) A person must not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.

(2) A person must not accept a DO rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO or DX rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.

(3) A person must not accept a DX rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.

(4) If a person is unable to fill all the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.

####### Optional rejection.

(c)Unless otherwise directed by FEMA, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:

(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;

(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not performed;

(3) If the order is for an item produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production, whichever is greater, sold within the past two years;

(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the Federal Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;

(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of FEMA issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant statute.

####### Customer notification requirements.

(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in written electronic format within 15 working days after receipt of a DO rated order and within 10 working days after receipt of a DX rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in written electronic format for the rejection.

(2) If a rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary or appropriate to meet these requirements and the order includes the statement set forth in § 333.12(b), a person must accept or reject the rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection in written electronic format within the time specified in the rated order. The minimum times for acceptance or rejection that such orders may specify are 6 hours after receipt of the order if the order is issued by an authorized person in response to a hazard that has occurred, or 12 hours after receipt if the order is issued by an authorized person to prepare for an imminent hazard.

(3) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written electronic confirmation must be provided within 24 hours of the verbal notice.

###### § 333.14 Preferential scheduling.

(a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.

(b) DO rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary, to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery against unrated orders. Similarly, DX rated orders must be given preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders.

####### Examples:

(1)If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX rated order. However, if business operations cannot be altered to meet both the June 3 and July 15 delivery dates, then the DX rated order must be given priority over the DO rated order.

(2) [Reserved]

####### Conflicting rated orders.

(c)(1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person must give preference to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting rated orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person must give preference to those orders which have the earliest receipt dates.

(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart E of this part. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart E of this part. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 333.13(d)(3).

(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 333.17(b).

###### § 333.15 Extension of priority ratings.

(a) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by FEMA.

(b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order placed to obtain items needed to fill a customer's rated order. Therefore, the inclusion of the rating will continue from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire supply chain.

(c) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items needed to fill an emergency preparedness rated order. That person must require acceptance or rejection, and transmission of that acceptance or rejection by the supplier within the time limit stated in the rated order that is being filled.

###### § 333.16 Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.

(a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or cancelled by:

(1) An official action of FEMA; or

(2) Written electronic notification from the person who placed the rated order (including a Delegate Agency).

(b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.

(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 333.13.

(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: A change in shipping destination; A reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design (prior to the start of production); or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.

(e) A person must cancel any rated orders that the person (or a predecessor in interest) has placed with suppliers or cancel the priority ratings on those orders if the person no longer needs the items in those orders to fill a rated order.

(f) A person adding a rating to an unrated order, or changing or cancelling a priority rating must promptly provide written electronic notification to all suppliers to whom the order was sent of the addition, change, or cancellation.

###### § 333.17 Use of rated orders.

(a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:

(1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed, or converted into scrap or by-products, in the course of processing;

(2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make delivery of the finished items against rated orders;

(3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill rated orders; and

(4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders.

(b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items (including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, as follows:

(1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.

(2) A DO rating symbol and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating symbol may not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX rated order.

(3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined.

(c) A person may combine DX and DO rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly.

####### Combining rated and unrated orders.

(d)(1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:

(i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and

(ii) The elements of a rated order, as required by § 333.12, are included on the order with the statement required in § 333.12(d) modified to read in substance: "This purchase order contains rated order quantities certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Emergency Management Priorities and Allocations System regulations (44 CFR part 333) as it pertains to the rated quantities."

(2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 333.13 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part may not be used to give preferential treatment to the unrated portion of the order.

(3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception under § 333.70.

(e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.

(f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than one half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)) (see 48 CFR 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.

###### § 333.18 Limitations on placing rated orders.

####### General limitations on placing rated orders.

(a)A person may not place a DO or DX rated order pursuant to this part unless the person is in receipt of a rated order, has been explicitly authorized to do so by FEMA or a Delegate Agency or is otherwise permitted to do so by this part.

####### Specific limitations on placing rated orders.

(b)Rated orders may not be used to obtain:

(1) Delivery on a date earlier than needed;

(2) A greater quantity of the item than needed, except to obtain a minimum procurable quantity. Separate rated orders may not be placed solely for the purpose of obtaining minimum procurable quantities on each order if the minimum procurable quantity would be sufficient to cover more than one rated order;

(3) Items in advance of the receipt of a rated order, except as specifically authorized by FEMA (see § 333.21(c) for information on obtaining authorization for a priority rating in advance of a rated order); or

(4) Any of the following items unless specific priority rating authority has been obtained from FEMA, a Delegate Agency, or the Department of Commerce:

(i) Items for plant improvement, expansion, or construction, unless they will be physically incorporated into a construction project covered by a rated order; or

(ii) Production or construction equipment or items to be used for the manufacture of production equipment (for information on requesting priority rating authority, see § 333.21).

(5) Any items related to the development of chemical or biological warfare capabilities or the production of chemical or biological weapons, unless such development or production has been authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense.

###### § 333.19 Special provisions applicable to rated orders for third parties.

(a) The provisions of this part apply to rated orders placed by FEMA or a Delegate Agency to facilitate sales to third parties, regardless of the nature of their relationship to the Federal Government, unless otherwise specified.

(b) Where FEMA or a Delegate Agency has placed a rated order to facilitate a sale to a third party, the third party is responsible for satisfying the applicable terms of sale and payment. The Federal Government shall not be liable for any failure to meet the terms of sale or payment.

(c) If a third party is unable to satisfy the applicable terms of sale or payment, FEMA or the Delegate Agency may amend or cancel the rated order pursuant to § 333.16 of this part. If FEMA or the Delegate Agency amend the rated order to provide that delivery shall be made to FEMA, the Delegate Agency, or another third party instead of the original third party, and the amendment shall not constitute a new rated order.

##### Subpart E - Special Priorities Assistance

###### § 333.20 General provisions.

(a) EMPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, if production or delivery problems arise, a person should immediately contact FEMA (or the Delegate Agency, as appropriate) for special priorities assistance pursuant to §§ 333.20 through 333.24 and as directed by § 333.83. If FEMA (or the Delegate Agency, as appropriate) is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, FEMA (or the Delegate Agency, as appropriate) may forward the request to another resource agency, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate problems.

(b) Special priorities assistance can be provided for any reason consistent with this part, such as assisting in obtaining timely deliveries of items needed to satisfy rated orders or authorizing the use of priority ratings on orders to obtain items not otherwise ratable under this part. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.

(c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority may be submitted on FEMA Form 009-0-142 (OMB control number 1660-0149) to FEMA. Form 009-0-142 may be obtained from the Delegate Agency or from FEMA.

###### § 333.21 Requests for priority rating authority.

(a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items.

####### Rating authority for production or construction equipment.

(b)(1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment, if needed, must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999.

(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.

####### Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract.

(c)(1) In certain cases, and upon specific request, FEMA, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from FEMA or the appropriate Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk associated with the placing of rated orders if these orders have to be cancelled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.

(2) The person must state the following in the request: "It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from FEMA (or a Delegate Agency) and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits the Delegate Agency, FEMA, or any other Federal Government agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request."

(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, FEMA will consider, among other things, the following criteria:

(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;

(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;

(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;

(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time; and

(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.

(4) FEMA may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.

(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person must promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to the advance rating authority that the priority rating on those orders is cancelled.

###### § 333.22 Examples of assistance.

(a) While special priorities assistance may be provided for any reason in support of this part, it is usually provided in situations where:

(1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery against a rated order by the required delivery date; or

(2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item needed to fill a rated order.

(b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:

(1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by suppliers;

(2) Resolving production or delivery conflicts between various rated orders;

(3) Assisting in placing rated orders with suppliers;

(4) Verifying the urgency of rated orders; and

(5) Determining the validity of rated orders.

###### § 333.23 Criteria for assistance.

####### i.e.,

Requests for special priorities assistance should be timely,the request must be submitted promptly and in enough time for FEMA or the Delegate Agency to effect a meaningful resolution to the problem, and must establish that:

(a) There is an urgent need for the item; and

(b) The applicant has made a reasonable effort to resolve the problem.

###### § 333.24 Instances where assistance will not be provided.

Special priorities assistance is provided at the discretion of FEMA or the Delegate Agency when it is determined that such assistance is warranted to meet the objectives of this part. Examples where assistance may not be provided include situations when a person is attempting to:

(a) Secure a price advantage;

(b) Obtain delivery prior to the time required to fill a rated order;

(c) Gain competitive advantage;

(d) Disrupt an industry apportionment program in a manner designed to provide a person with an unwarranted share of scarce items; or

(e) Overcome a supplier's regularly established terms of sale or conditions of doing business.

##### Subpart F - Allocation Actions

###### § 333.30 Policy.

(a) Allocation orders will:

(1) Be used only when there is insufficient supply of a material, service, or facility to satisfy national defense requirements through the use of the priorities authority or when the use of the priorities authority would cause a severe and prolonged disruption in the supply of materials, services, or facilities available to support normal U.S. economic activities; and

(2) Not be used to ration materials or services at the retail level.

(b) Allocation orders, when used, will be distributed equitably among the suppliers of the materials, services, or facilities being allocated and not require any person to relinquish a disproportionate share of the civilian market.

(c) When a hazard has occurred or is imminent, an allocation order may be used without regard to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section whenever it is deemed by the Administrator to be necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.

###### § 333.31 General procedures.

Before FEMA uses its allocations authority to address a supply problem within its resource jurisdiction, it will develop a plan that includes:

(a) A copy of the written determination that the program or programs that would be supported by the allocation action are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense;

(b) A detailed description of the situation to include any unusual events or circumstances that have created the requirement for an allocation action;

(c) A statement of the specific objective(s) of the allocation action;

(d) A list of the materials, services, or facilities to be allocated;

(e) A list or description of the sources of the materials, services, or facilities that will be subject to the allocation action;

####### e.g.,

(f) A detailed description of the provisions that will be included in the allocation orders, including the type(s) of allocation orders, the percentages or quantity of capacity or output to be allocated for each purpose, and the duration of the allocation action (anticipated start and end dates);

(g) An evaluation of the impact of the proposed allocation action on the civilian market; and

(h) Proposed actions, if any, to mitigate disruptions to civilian market operations.

###### § 333.32 Controlling the general distribution of a material in the civilian market.

No allocation action by FEMA may be used to control the general distribution of a material in the civilian market unless the President, the Administrator, or another official with lawful authority under section 101(b) of the Act has made a written finding that:

(a) Such material is a scarce and critical material essential to the national defense, and

(b) The requirements of the national defense for such material cannot otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such a degree as to create appreciable hardship.

###### § 333.33 Types of allocation orders.

There are three types of allocation orders available for communicating allocation actions.

####### Set-aside.

(a)A set-aside is an official action that requires a person to reserve materials, services, or facilities capacity in anticipation of the receipt of rated orders.

####### Directive.

(b)A directive is an official action that requires a person to take or refrain from taking certain actions in accordance with its provisions. For example, a directive can require a person to: Stop or reduce production of an item; prohibit the use of selected materials, services, or facilities; or divert the use of materials, services, or facilities from one purpose to another.

####### Allotment.

(c)An allotment is an official action that specifies the maximum quantity of a material, service, or facility authorized for a specific use to promote the national defense.

###### § 333.34 Elements of an allocation order.

Allocation orders may be issued directly to the affected persons or by constructive notice through publication in theThis section describes the elements that each order must include.

####### Elements to be included in all allocation orders.

(a)(1) A detailed description of the required allocation action(s), including its relationship to previously or subsequently received DX rated orders, DO rated orders, and unrated orders.

(2) Specific start and end calendar dates for each required allocation action.

####### Elements to be included in orders issued directly to affected persons.

(b)(1) A statement that reads in substance: "This is an allocation order certified for national defense use.

#### PART 334 - GRADUATED MOBILIZATION RESPONSE

##### § 334.1 Purpose.

(a) Provides policy guidance pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended; section 1-103 of Executive Order 12148, as amended, which includes functions continued from E.O. 11051; section 104(f) of Executive Order 12656; and part 2 of Executive Order 10480.

(b) Establishes a Graduated Mobilization Response (GMR) system for developing and implementing mobilization actions that are responsive to a wide range of national security threats and ambiguous or specific warning indicators. GMR provides for a coherent decision making process with which to proceed with specific responses to an identified crisis or emergency.

(c) Provides guidance to the Federal departments and agencies for developing plans that are responsive to a GMR system and for preparing costed option packages, as appropriate, to implement the plans.

##### § 334.2 Policy.

(a) As established in Executive Order 12656, the policy of the United States is to have sufficient emergency response capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense and civilian needs during any national security emergency. Accordingly, each Federal department and agency shall prepare its national security emergency preparedness plans and programs to respond adequately and in a timely manner to all national security emergencies.

(b) As part of emergency response, the GMR system should be incorporated in each department's and agency's emergency preparedness plans and programs to provide appropriate and effective response options for consideration in reacting to ambiguous and specific warnings.

(c) Departments and agencies will be provided early warning information developed by the intelligence community and policy statements of the President.

(d) Emergency resource preparedness planning is essential to ensure that the nation is adequately prepared to respond to potential national emergencies. Such emergency resource preparedness planning requires an exchange of information and planning factors among the various departments and agencies responsible for different resource preparedness actitivities.

(e) To carry out their emergency planning activities, civilian departments and agencies require the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potential military demands that would be made on the economy in a full range of possible national security emergencies. Similarly, DOD planning should be conducted using planning regimes consistent with the policies and plans of the civilian resource departments and agencies.

(f) Under section 104(c) of Executive Order 12656, FEMA is responsible for coordinating the implementation of national emergency preparedness policy with Federal departments and agencies and with state and local governments and, therefore, is responsible for developing a system of planning procedures for integrating the emergency preparedness actions of federal, state and local governments.

(g) Federal departments and agencies shall design their preparedness measures to permit a rapid and effective transition from routine to emergency operations, and to make effective use of the period following initial indication of a probable national security emergency. This will include:

(1) Development of a system of emergency actions that defines alternatives, processes, and issues to be considered during various stages of national security emergencies; and

(2) Identification of actions that could be taken at the Federal and local levels of government in the early stages of a national security emergency or pending national security emergency to mitigate the impact of or reduce significantly the leadtime associated with full emergency action implementation.

##### § 334.3 Background.

(a) The GMR system is designed to take into account the need to mobilize the Nation's resources in response to a wide range of crisis or emergency situations. GMR is a flexible decision making process of preparedness and response actions which are appropriate to warning indicators or an event. Thus, GMR allows the government, as a whole, to take small or large, often reversible, steps to increase its national security emergency preparedness posture.

(b) Crises, especially those resulting in major military activities, always have some political or economic context. As the risks of military action increase, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer period of time to increase their military power. Such preparations by potential adversaries shape the nature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing of occurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicators of threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on the nature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warning indicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrial sectors.

(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planning and actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use it to reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence should fail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phased actions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essential civilian requirements. The GMR system integrates the potential strength of the national economy into U.S. national security strategy.

##### § 334.4 Definitions.

###### Graduated Mobilization Response

(a)(GMR) is a system for integrating mobilization actions designed to respond to ambiguous and/or specific warnings. These actions are designed to mitigate the impact of an event or crisis and reduce significantly the lead time associated with a full national emergency action implementation.

###### National security emergency

(b)is any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States.

###### Mobilization

(c)is the process of marshalling resources, both civil and military, to respond to and manage a national security emergency.

###### GMR Plans

(d)are those agency documents that describe, in general, the actions that an agency could take in the early stages of a national security emergency, or upon receipt of warning information about a possible national security emergency. These actions would be designed to mitigate the impact of, or reduce significantly, the lead times associated with full emergency action implementation. Such plans are required by section 201(4)(b) of Executive Order 12656.

###### A Costed Option Package

(e)is a document that describes in detail a particular action that an agency could take in the early stages of a national security emergency. The general content of a GMR costed option package includes alternative response options; the resource implications of each option; shortfalls, costs, timeframes and political feasibility.

##### § 334.5 GMR system description.

The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity (additional intermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a Federal department or agency might divide "Crisis Management" into two, three, or more levels as suits its needs.

###### Stage 3, Planning and Preparation.

(a)During the planning and preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities in accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertaken to overcome identified problems.

###### Stage 2, Crisis Management.

(b)During the crisis management stage, GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.

(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.

(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new funding.

(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items for future use.

###### Stage 1, National Emergency/War.

(c)During a national emergency or declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production. Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency responsibilities.

##### § 334.6 Department and agency responsibilities.

(a) During Stage 3, each Federal department and agency with mobilization responsibilities will develop GMR plans as part of its emergency preparedness planning process in order to meet possible future crisis. Costed Option Packages will be developed for actions that may be necessary in the early warning period. Option packages will be reviewed, focused and refined during Stage 2 to meet the particular emergency.

(b) Each department and agency should identify response actions appropriate for the early stage of any crisis or emergency situation, which then will be reviewed, focused and refined in Stage 2 for execution, as appropriate. GMR plans should contain a menu of costed option packages that provide details of alternative measures that may be used in an emergency situation.

(c) FEMA will provide guidance pursuant to Executive Order 12656 and will coordinate GMR plans and option packages of DOD and the civilian departments and agencies to ensure consistency and to identify areas where additional planning or investment is needed.

(d) During State 2, FEMA will coordinate department and agency recommendations for action and forward them to the National Security Advisor to make certain that consistency with the overall national strategy planning is achieved.

(e) Departments and agencies will refine their GMR plans to focus on the specific crisis situation. Costed option packages should be refined to identify the resources necessary for the current crisis, action taken to obtain those resources, and GMR plans implemented consistent with the seriousness of the crisis.

(f) At Stage 1, declaration of national emergency or war, the crisis is under the control of NSC or other central authority, with GMR being integrated into partial, full or total mobilization. At this point the more traditional mechanisms of resource mobilization are pursued, focusing on resource allocation and adjudication with cognizance of the essential civilian demand.

(g) Programs and plans developed by the departments and agencies under this guidance should be shared, as appropriate, with States, local governments and the private sector to provide a baseline for their development of supporting programs and plans.

##### § 334.7 Reporting.

The Administrator of FEMA shall provide the President with periodic assessments of the Federal departments and agencies capabilities to respond to national security emergencies and periodic reports to the National Security Council on the implementation of the national security emergency preparedness policy. Pursuant to section 201(15) of Executive Order 12656, departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall consult and coordinate with the Administrator of FEMA to ensure that their activities and plans are consistent with current National Security Council guidelines and policies. An evaluation of the Federal departments and agencies participation in the graduated mobilization response program may be included in these reports.

#### PARTS 335-349 [RESERVED]

#### PART 350 - REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF STATE AND LOCAL RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PLANS AND PREPAREDNESS

##### § 350.1 Purpose.

The purpose of the regulation in this part is to establish policy and procedures for review and approval by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of State and local emergency plans and preparedness for the offsite effects of a radiological emergency which may occur at a commercial nuclear power facility. Review and approval of these plans and preparedness involves preparation of findings and determinations of the adequacy of the plans and capabilities of State and local governments to effectively implement the plans.

##### § 350.2 Definitions.

As used in this part, the following terms are defined:

###### Administrator

(a)means the Administrator, FEMA, or designee;

###### Regional Administrator

(b)means a Regional Administrator of FEMA, or designee;

###### Deputy Administrator

(c)means the , National Preparedness Directorate, FEMA, or designee;

##### § 350.3 Background.

(a) On December 7, 1979, the President directed the Administrator of FEMA to take the lead in State and local emergency planning and preparedness activities with respect to nuclear power facilities. This included a review of the existing emergency plans both in States with operating reactors and those with plants scheduled for operation in the near future.

(b) This assignment was given to FEMA because of its responsibilities under Executive Order 12148 to establish Federal policies for and coordinate civil emergency planning, management and assistance functions and to represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness programs. Under section 201 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5131), and other statutory functions, the Administrator of FEMA is charged with the responsibility to develop and implement plans and programs of disaster preparedness.

(c) There are two sections in the NRC's fiscal year 1982/1983 Appropriation Authorization (Pub. L. 97-415) that pertain to the scope of this rule.

(1) Section 5 provides for the issuance of an operating license for a commercial nuclear power plant by the NRC if it is determined that there exists a State, local or utility plan which provides assurance that public health and safety is not endangered by the operation of the facility. This section would allow the NRC to issue an operating license for such plants without FEMA-approved State and local government plans.

(2) Section 11 provides for the issuance of temporary licenses for operating a utilization facility at a specific power level to be determined by the Commission, pending final action by the Commission on the application. Also, this section authorizes the NRC to issue temporary operating licenses for these facilities without the completion of the required (NRC) Commission hearing process. A petition for such a temporary license may not be filed until certain actions are completed including the submission of a State, local or utility emergency response plan for the facility.

(d) To carry out these responsibilities, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope with the offsite effects resulting from radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. FEMA developed and published the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan 50 FR 46542 Nov. 8, 1985, to provide the overall support to State and local governments, for all types of radiological incidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants.

(e) FEMA has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the NRC to which it will furnish assessments, findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans and preparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). These findings and determinations will be used by NRC under its own rules in connection with its licensing and regulatory requirements and FEMA will support its findings in the NRC licensing process and related court proceedings.

(f) Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in these rules for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings and determinations on the current status of emergency preparedness around particular sites may be requested by the NRC and provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. These findings and determinations may be based upon plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA by the NRC through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.

(g) An environmental assessment has been prepared on which FEMA has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

##### § 350.4 Exclusions.

The regulation in this part does not apply to, nor will FEMA apply any criteria with respect to, any evaluation, assessment or determination regarding the NRC licensee's emergency plans or preparedness, nor shall FEMA make any similar determination with respect to the integration of offsite and NRC licensee emergency preparedness except as these assessments and determinations affect the emergency preparedness of State and local governments. The regulation in this part applies only to State and local planning and preparedness with respect to emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities and does not apply to other facilities which may be licensed by NRC, nor to United States Government-owned, non-licensed facilities nor the jurisdictions surrounding them.

##### § 350.5 Criteria for review and approval of State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness.

###### Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants

(a) Section 50.47 of NRC's Emergency Planning Rule (10 CFR parts 50 (appendix E) and 70 as amended) and the joint FEMA-NRC(NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, November 1980) which apply insofar as FEMA is concerned to State and local governments, are to be used in reviewing, evaluating and approving State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness and in making any findings and determinations with respect to the adequacy of the plans and the capabilities of State and local governments to implement them. Both the planning and preparedness standards and related criteria contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are to be used by FEMA and the NRC in reviewing and evaluating State and local government radiological emergency plans and preparedness. For brevity, only the planning standards contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are presented below.

(1) Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear facility licensee, and by State and local organizations within the Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been specifically established and each principal response organization has staff to respond to and augment its initial response on a continuous basis.

(2) On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency response are unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support and response activities are specified. (This standard applies only to NRC licensees but is included here for completeness.)

(3) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned response have been identified.

(4) A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.

(5) Procedures have been established for notification, by the licensee, of State and local response organizations and for the notification of emergency personnel by all response organizations; the content of initial and followup messages to response organizations and the public has been established; and means to provide early notification and clear instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone have been established.

(6) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.

(7) Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical location or locations) are established in advance and procedures for coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.

(8) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response are provided and maintained.

(9) Adequate methods, systems and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use.

(10) A range of protective actions has been developed for the plume exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. Guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, are developed and in place and protective actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale have been developed.

(11) Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.

(12) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated injured individuals.

(13) General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.

(14) Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills and deficiencies identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.

(15) Radiological emergency response training is provided to those who may be called upon to assist in an emergency.

(16) Responsibilities for plan development and review and for distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are properly trained.

(b) In order for State of local plans and preparedness to be approved, such plans and preparedness must be determined to adequately protect the public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.

##### § 350.6 Assistance in development of State and local plans.

(a) An integrated approach to the development of offsite radiological emergency plans by States, localities and the licensees of NRC with the assistance of the Federal Government is the approach most likely to provide the best protection to the public. Hence, Federal agencies, including FEMA Regional staff, will be made available upon request to assist States and localities in the development of plans.

(b) There now exists in each of the ten standard Federal Regions a Regional Assistance Committee (RAC) (formerly the Regional Advisory Committee) chaired by a FEMA Regional official and having members from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce. Whereas in 44 CFR part 351, the Department of Defense is listed as a potential member of the RACs, it is not listed in this rule because military nuclear facilities are not the subject of concern. The RACs will assist State and local government officials in the development of their radiological emergency response plans, and will review plans and observe exercises to evaluate the adequacy of these plans and related preparedness. This assistance does not include the actual writing of State and local government plans by RAC members.

(c) In accomplishing the foregoing, the RACs will use the standards and criteria in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, and will render such technical assistance as may be required, appropriate to their agency mission and expertise. In observing and evaluating exercises, the RACs will identify, soon after an exercise, any deficiencies observed in the planning and preparedness effort including deficiencies in resources, training of staff, equipment, staffing levels and deficiencies in the qualifications of personnel.

##### § 350.7 Application by State for review and approval.

(a) A State which seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiological emergency plan shall submit an application for such review and approval to the FEMA Regional Administrator of the Region in which the State is located. The application, in the form of a letter from the Governor or from such other State official as the Governor may designate, shall contain one copy of the completed State plan, including coverage of response in the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. The application will also include plans of all appropriate local governments. The application shall specify the site or sites for which plan approval is sought. For guidance on the local government plans that should be included with an application, refer to Part I.E. NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, entitled Contiguous Jurisdiction Governmental Emergency Planning (see (e)). Only a State may request formal review of State or local radiological emergency plans.

(b) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power facilities shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 Km) in radius and the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 Km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power facility shall be determined by State and local governments in consultation with FEMA and NRC taking into account such local conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes and local jurisdiction boundaries. The size of the EPZs may be determined by NRC in consultation with FEMA on a case-by-case basis for gas cooled reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 Mw thermal. The plans for the ingestion exposure pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the public from ingesting contaminated food and water.

(c) A State may submit separately its plans for the EPZs and the local government plans related to individual nuclear power facilities. The purpose of separate submissions is to allow approval of a State plan, and of the plans necessary for specific nuclear power facilities in a multiple-facility State, while not approving or acting on the plans necessary for other nuclear power facilities within the State. If separate submissions are made, appropriate adjustments in the State plan may be necessary. In any event, FEMA approval of State plans and appropriate local government plans shall be site specific.

(d) The applications shall contain a statement that the State plan, together with the appropriate local plans, is, in the opinion of the State, adequate to protect the public health and safety of its citizens living within the emergency planning zones for the nuclear power facilities included in the submission by providing reasonable assurance that State and local governments can and intend to effect appropriate protective measures offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.

(e) FEMA and the States will make suitable arrangements in the case of overlapping or adjacent jurisdictions to permit an orderly assessment and approval of interstate or interregional plans.

##### § 350.8 Initial FEMA action on State plan.

(a) The Regional Administrator shall acknowledge in writing within ten days the receipt of the State application.

(b) FEMA shall publish a notice signed by the Regional Administrator or designee in thewithin 30 days after receipt of the application, that an application from a State has been received and that copies are available at the Regional Office for review and copying in accordance with 44 CFR 5.26.

(c) The Regional Administrator shall furnish copies of the plan to members of the RAC for their analysis and evaluation.

(d) The Regional Administrator shall make a detailed review of the State plan, including those of local governments, and assess the capability of State and local governments to effectively implement the plan (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). Evaluation and comments of the RAC members will be used as part of the review process.

(e) In connection with the review, the Regional Administrator may make suggestions to States concerning perceived gaps or deficiencies in the plans, and the State may amend the plan at any time prior to forwarding to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.

(f) Two conditions for FEMA approval of State plans (including local government plans) are the requirements for an exercise (see § 350.9), and for public participation (see §§ 350.9 and 350.10.). These activities occur during the Regional review and prior to the forwarding of the plan to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.

##### § 350.9 Exercises.

(a) Before a Regional Administrator can forward a State plan to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate for approval, the State, together with all appropriate local governments, must conduct a joint exercise of that State plan, involving full participationof appropriate local government entities, the State and the appropriate licensee of the NRC. To the extent achievable, this exercise shall include participation by appropriate Federal agencies. This exercise shall be observed and evaluated by FEMA and by representatives of other Federal agencies with membership on the RACs and by NRC with respect to licensee response. Within 48 hours of the completion of the exercise, a briefing involving the exercise participants and Federal observers shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator to discuss the preliminary results of the exercise. If the exercise discloses any deficiencies in the State and local plans, or the ability of the State and local governments to implement the plans, the FEMA representatives shall make them known promptly in writing to appropriate State officials. To the extent necessary, the State shall amend the plan to incorporate recommended changes or improvements or take other corrective measures, such as remedial exercises,to demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that identified weaknesses have been corrected.

(b) The Regional Administrator shall be the FEMA official responsible for certifying to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate that an exercise of the State plan has been conducted, and that changes and corrective measures in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section have been made.

(c) State and local governments that have fully participated in a joint exercise within one year prior to the effective date of this final rule will have continuing approval of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness by following the frequency indicated in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section. State and local governments that have not fully participated in a joint exercise within one year prior to the effective date of this final rule will follow the frequency indicated in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section after completion of a joint exercise in which they have fully participated. If, in developing exercise schedules with State and local governments to implement the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section, the Regional Administrator finds that unusual hardships would result, he may seek relief from the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.

(1) Each State which has a commercial nuclear power site within its boundaries or is within the 10-mile plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone of such site shall fully participate in an exercise jointly with the nuclear power plant licensee and appropriate local governments at least every two years.

(2) Each State with multiple sites within its boundaries shall fully participate in a joint exercise at some site on a rotational basis at least every 2 years. When not fully participating in an exercise at a site, the State shall partially participateat that site to support the full participation of appropriate local governments. Priority shall be given to new facilities seeking an operating license from the NRC and which have not fully participated in a joint exercise involving the State, local governments and the licensee at that site. State and local governments will coordinate the scheduling of these exercises with the appropriate FEMA and NRC Regional Offices and the affected licensees.

(3) Each appropriate local government which has a site within its boundaries or is within the 10-mile emergency planning zone shall fully participate in a joint exercise with the licensee and the State at least every two years. For those local governments that have planning and preparedness responsibilities for more than one facility, the Regional Administrator may seek an exemption from this requirement by recommending alternative arrangements for approval by the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate.

(4) States within the 50-mile emergency planning zone of a site shall exercise their plans and preparedness related to ingestion exposure pathway measures at least once every five years in conjunction with a plume exposure pathway exercise for that site.

(5) Remedial exercises may be required to correct deficiencies observed in exercises conducted for continued FEMA approval. Should this occur, the FEMA Regional Administrator will determine the participation required from the States and/or local governments.

(d) Within 48 hours of the completion of an exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval, a briefing involving the exercise participants and Federal observers shall be conducted by the Regional Administrator to discuss the preliminary results of the exercise. If the exercise discloses any deficiencies in the State and local plans, or the ability of the State and local governments to implement the plans, the FEMA representatives shall make them known promptly in writing to appropriate State officials. To the extent necessary, the State shall amend the plan to incorporate recommended changes or improvements or take other corrective measures, such as remedial exercises, to demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that identified weaknesses have been corrected. The Regional Administrator shall forward his or her evaluation of the exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate including the certification that changes and corrective measures have been made.

(e) Following the exercise conducted for continued FEMA approval, the Regional Administrator shall conduct a meeting in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility which will include the exercise participants, representatives from the NRC and other appropriate Federal agencies and the public and media as observers. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the evaluation of the exercise. At the discretion of the Regional Administrator, written comments from the public and media may be submitted at or after the meeting. These comments will be taken into consideration by the Regional Administrator in his or her evaluation.

(f) After FEMA approval of a State and local plan has been granted, failure to exercise the State and local plans at the frequency and participation described in this section shall be grounds for withdrawing FEMA approval. (See § 350.13.)

##### § 350.10 Public meeting in advance of FEMA approval.

(a) During the FEMA Regional Office review of a State plan and prior to the submission by the Regional Administrator of the evaluation of the plan and exercise to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, the FEMA Regional Administrator shall assure that there is at least one public meeting conducted in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility. The purpose of such a meeting, which may be conducted by the State or by the Regional Administrator, shall be to:

(1) Acquaint the members of the public in the vicinity of each facility with the content of the State and related local plans, and with the conduct of the joint exercise which tested the plans;

(2) Answer any questions about FEMA review of the plan and the exercise;

(3) Receive suggestions from the public concerning improvements or changes that may be necessary; and

(4) Describe to the public the way in which the plan is expected to function in the event of an actual emergency.

(b) The Regional Administrator should assure that representatives from appropriate State and local government agencies, and the affected utility appear at such meetings to make presentations and to answer questions from the public. The public meeting should be held after the first joint (utility, State and local governments) exercise at a time mutually agreed to by State and local authorities, licensee and FEMA and NRC Regional officials. This meeting shall be noticed in the local newspaper with the largest circulation in the area, or other such media as the Regional Administrator may select, on at least two occasions, one of which is at least two weeks before the meeting takes place and the other is within a few days of the meeting date. Local radio and television stations should be notified of the scheduled meeting at least one week in advance. Representatives from NRC and other appropriate Federal agencies should also be invited to participate in these meetings. If, in the judgment of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the public meeting or meetings reveal deficiencies in the State plan and/or the joint exercise, the Regional Administrator shall inform the State of the fact together with recommendations for improvement. No FEMA approval of State and local plans and preparedness shall be made until a meeting described in this paragraph shall have been held at or near the nuclear power facility site for which the State is seeking approval.

##### § 350.11 Action by FEMA Regional Administrator.

(a) Upon completion of his or her review, including conduct of the exercise required by § 350.9 and after the public meeting required by § 350.10, the Regional Administrator shall prepare an evaluation of the State plan, including plans for local governments. Such evaluation shall be specific with respect to the plans applicable to each nuclear facility so that findings and determinations can be made by the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate on a site-specific basis.

(b) The Regional Administrator shall evaluate the adequacy of State and local plans and preparedness on the basis of the criteria set forth in § 350.5, and shall report the evaluation with respect to each of the planning standards mentioned therein as such apply to State and local plans and preparedness.

(c) The Regional Administrator shall forward the State plan together with his or her evaluation and other relevant record material to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate. Relevant record material will include the results of the exercise (i.e., deficiencies noted and corrections made), a summary of the deficiencies identified during the public meeting, recommendations made to the State and commitments made by the State for effecting improvements in its plans and preparedness and actions taken by the State.

##### § 350.12 FEMA Headquarters review and approval.

(a) Upon receipt from a Regional Administrator of a State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall conduct such review of the State plan as he or she shall deem necessary. The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall arrange for copies of the plan, together with the Regional Administrator's evaluation, to be made available to the members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee (FRPCC) and to other offices of FEMA with appropriate guidance relative to any assistance that may be needed in the FEMA review and approval process.

(b) If, after formal submission of the State plan and the Regional Administrator's evaluation, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate determines that the State plans and preparedness:

(1) Are adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency; and

(2) Are capable of being implemented (e.g. adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy); the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall approve in writing the State plan. The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall concurrently communicate this FEMA approval to the Governor of the State(s) in question, the NRC and the pertinent Regional Administrator(s) and immediately shall publish in thea notice of this effect.

(c) If, after formal submission of the State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate is not satisfied with the adequacy of the plan or preparedness with respect to a particular site, he or she shall concurrently communicate that decision to the Governor(s) of the State(s), the NRC and the pertinent Regional Administrator(s), together with a statement in writing explaining the reasons for the decision and requesting appropriate plan or preparedness revision. Such statement shall be transmitted to the Governor(s) through the appropriate Regional Administrator(s). The Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall immediately publish a notice to this effect in the

(d) The approval shall be of the State plan together with the local plans for each nuclear power facility (including out-of-State facilities) for which approval has been requested. FEMA may withhold approval of plans applicable to a specific nuclear power facility in a multi-facility State, but nevertheless approve the State plan and associated local plans applicable to other facilities in a State. Approval may be withheld for a specific site until plans for all jurisdictions within the emergency planning zones of that site have been reviewed and found adequate.

(e) Within 30 days after the date of notification of approval for a particular nuclear power facility or within 30 days of any statement of disapproval of a State plan, any interested person may appeal the decision of the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate to the Administrator; however, such an appeal must be made solely upon the ground that the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate's decision, based on the available record, was unsupported by substantial evidence. (See § 350.15 for appeal procedures.)

##### § 350.13 Withdrawal of approval.

(a) If, at any time after granting approval of a State plan, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate determines, on his or her own initiative, motion or on the basis of information another person supplied, that the State or local plan is no longer adequate to protect public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken, or is no longer capable of being implemented, he or she shall immediately advise the Governor of the affected State, through the appropriate Regional Administrator and the NRC of that initial determination in writing. FEMA shall spell out in detail the reasons for its initial determination, and shall describe the deficiencies in the plan or the preparedness of the State. If, after four months from the date of such an initial determination, the State in question has not either:

(1) Corrected the deficiencies noted, or (2) submitted an acceptable plan for correcting those deficiencies, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall withdraw approval and shall immediately inform the NRC and the Governor of the affected State, of the determination to withdraw approval and shall publish in theand the local newspaper having the largest daily circulation in the affected State notice of its withdrawal or approval. The basis upon which the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate makes the determination for withdrawal of approval is the same basis used for reviewing plans and exercises, i.e., the planning standards and related criteria in NUREGO654/FEMA/REP-1, Rev. 1.

(b) In the event that the State in question shall submit a plan for correcting the deficiencies, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall negotiate a schedule and a timetable under which the State shall correct the deficiencies. If, on the agreed upon date, the deficiencies have been corrected, the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate shall withdraw the initial determination and the approval previously granted shall remain valid. He or she shall inform the Governor(s), the NRC, the pertinent Regional Administrator(s) and notify the public as stated in paragraph (a) of this section. If, however, on the agreed upon date, the deficiencies are not corrected, FEMA shall withdraw its approval and shall communicate its decision to the Governor of the State whose plan is in question, the NRC, the appropriate Federal agencies and notify the public as indicated above.

(c) Within 30 days after the date of notification of withdrawal of approval of a State or local plan, any interested person may appeal the decision of the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate to the Administrator; however, such an appeal must be made solely upon the ground that the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate's decision, based on the available record, was unsupported by substantial evidence. (See § 350.15 for appeal procedures.)

##### § 350.14 Amendments to State plans.

(a) The State may amend a plan submitted to FEMA for review and approval under § 350.7 at any time during the review process or may amend a plan at any time after FEMA approval has been granted under § 350.12. A State must amend its plan in order to extend the coverage of the plan to any new nuclear power facility which becomes operational after a FEMA approval or in case of any other significant change. The State plan shall remain in effect as approved while any significant change is under review.

(b) A significant change is one which involves the evaluation and assessment of a planning standard or which involves a matter which, if presented with the plan, would need to have been considered by the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate in making a decision that State or local plans and preparedness are:

(1) Adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency; and

(2) Capable of being implemented.

(c) A significant change will be processed in the same manner as if it were an initial plan submission. However, the Regional Administrator may determine that certain procedures, such as holding a public meeting or a complete exercise, would be unnecessary. The existing FEMA approval shall remain in effect while any significant changes are under review.

(d) Changes, such as a change in a telephone number, that are not significant as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, but are necessary to maintain currency of the plan, should be forwarded to the Regional Administrator.

##### § 350.15 Appeal procedures.

(a) Any interested person may appeal a decision made under §§ 350.12 and 350.13 of this part, by submitting to the Administrator, FEMA, a written notice of appeal, within 30 days after the appearance in theof the notice of decision relating to the matter being appealed. The appeal must be addressed to the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20472. The appeal letter shall state specific reasons for the appeal and include an offer to provide documentation supporting appellate arguments.

(b) Upon receipt of an appeal, the Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall review the file, as submitted to the Deputy Administrator for the National Preparedness Directorate, by the Regional Administrator of the FEMA Region concerned, based on the information contained in the file and the appeal letter, with supporting documentation. The Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall decide whether or not the Associate Director's initial decision was supported by substantial evidence in the file and is consistent with FEMA policy.

(c) The decision of the Administrator or the Administrator's designee shall be published in theas the final agency decision on the matter and shall not be reviewable within FEMA, except upon a showing that it was procured by fraud or misrepresentation. In addition to publication in thecopies of the decision shall be forwarded to the appellant, the Governor(s) of the State(s) affected, the NRC and the affected licensee of the involved power facility.

This rate will be charged when FEMA performs such services as: Development of exercise objectives and scenarios, pre-exercise logistics, exercise conduct and participation, evaluation, meetings and reports; review and approval of Plan revisions that are utility-requested or exercise inadequacy related; remedial exercise, medical drill or any other exercise or drill upon which a license is predicated, with regard to preparation, review, conduct, participation, evaluation, meetings and reports; the issuance of interim findings pursuant to the FEMA/NRC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (App. A of this part); review of utility plan submissions through the NRC under the MOU; utility certification submission review under 44 CFR part 352 and follow-on activities; site-specific adjudicatory proceedings and any other site-specific legal costs and technical assistance that is utility requested or exercise inadequacy related. The professional staff rate for FY 91 is $39.00 per hour. The referenced FEMA/NRC MOU is provided in this rule as appendix A. The professional staff rate for the REP Program and related legal services will be revised on a fiscal year basis using the most current fiscal data available and the revised hourly rate will be published as a notice in thefor each fiscal year if the rate increases or decreases.

##### § 353.6 Schedule of services.

Recipients shall be charged the full cost of site-specific services based upon the appropriate professional hourly staff rate for the FEMA services described in this Section and for related contractual services which will be charged to the licensee by FEMA, at the rate and cost incurred.

(a) When a State seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiological emergency response plan pursuant to 44 CFR part 350 (Review and Approval Process of State and Local Radiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness), FEMA shall provide the services as described in 44 CFR part 350 in regard to that request and fees will be charged for such services to the licensee, which is the ultimate beneficiary of FEMA services. This provision does not apply where an operating license has been granted or the application denied or withdrawn, except as necessary to support biennial exercises and related activities. Fees will be charged for all FEMA, but not other Federal agency activities related to such services, including but not limited to the following:

(1) Development of exercise objectives and scenarios, preexercise logistics, exercise conduct and participation, evaluation, meetings and reports.

(2) Review of plan revisions that are exercise-inadequacy related;

(3) Technical assistance that is exercise-inadequacy related;

(4) Remedial exercise, medical drill, or any other exercise or drill upon which maintenance of a license is predicated, with regard to preparation, review, conduct, participation, evaluation, meetings and reports.

(b) Interim findings. Where the NRC seeks from FEMA under the FEMA/NRC MOU an interim finding of the status of radiological emergency planning and preparedness at a particular time for a nuclear power plant, FEMA shall assess a fee to the licensee for providing this service. The provision of this service consists of making a determination whether the plans are adequate to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of the nuclear power facility by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency and that such plans are capable of being implemented.

(c) NRC utility plan submissions. Fees will be charged for all FEMA but not other Federal agency activities related to such services, including but not limited to the following:

(1) Development of exercise objectives and scenarios, preexercise logistics, exercise conduct and participation, evaluation and post-exercise meetings and reports.

(2) Notice and conduct of public meeting.

(3) Regional finding and determination of adequacy of plans and preparedness followed by review by FEMA Headquarters resulting in final FEMA determination of adequacy of plans and preparedness,

(4) Remedial exercise, medical drill, or any other exercise or drill upon which maintenance of a license is predicated, with regard to preparation, review, conduct, participation, evaluation, meetings and reports.

(d) Utility certification submission review. When a licensee seeks Federal assistance within the framework of 44 CFR part 352 due to the decline or failure of a State or local government to adequately prepare an emergency plan, FEMA shall process the licensee's certification and make the determination whether a decline or fail situation exists. Fees will be charged for services rendered in making the determination. Upon the determination that a decline or fail situation does exist, any services provided or secured by FEMA consisting of assistance to the licensee, as described in 44 CFR part 352, will have a fee charged for such services.

(e) FEMA participation in site-specific NRC adjudicatory proceedings and any other site-specific legal costs. Where FEMA participates in NRC licensing proceedings and any related court actions to support FEMA findings as a result of its review and approval of offsite emergency plans and preparedness, or provides legal support for any other site specific FEMA activities comprised in this rule, fees will be charged to the licensee for such participation.

(f) Rendering technical assistance. Where FEMA is requested by a licensee to provide any technical assistance, or where a State or local government requests technical assistance in order to correct an inadequacy identified as a result of a biennial exercise or any other drill or exercise upon which maintenance of a license is predicated, FEMA will charge such assistance to the licensee for the provision of such service.

##### § 353.7 Failure to pay.

###### et seq.

In any case where there is a dispute over the FEMA bill or where FEMA finds that a licensee has failed to pay a prescribed fee required under this part, procedures will be implemented in accordance with 44 CFR part 11 subpart C to effectuate collections under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711).

##### Appendix A to Part 353 - Memorandum of Understanding Between Federal Emergency Management Agency and Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have entered into a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness. This supersedes a memorandum entered into on November 1, 1980 (published December 16, 1980, 45 FR 82713), revised April 9, 1985 (published April 18, 1985, 50 FR 15485), and published as Appendix A to 44 CFR part 353. The substantive changes in the new MOU are: (1) Self-initiated review by the NRC; (2) Early Site Permit process; (3) adoption of FEMA exercise time-frames; (4) incorporation of FEMA definition of exercise deficiency; (5) NRC commitment to work with licensees in support of State and local governments to correct exercise deficiencies; (6) correlation of FEMA actions on withdrawal of approvals under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC enforcement actions; and (7) disaster-initiated reviews in situations that affect offsite emergency infrastructures. The text of the MOU follows.

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes a framework of cooperation between the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in radiological emergency response planning matters so that their mutual efforts will be directed toward more effective plans and related preparedness measures at and in the vicinity of nuclear reactors and fuel cycle facilities which are subject to 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, and certain other fuel cycle and materials licensees which have potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases. The memorandum is responsive to the President's decision of December 7, 1979, that FEMA will take the lead in offsite planning and response, his request that NRC assist FEMA in carrying out this role, and the NRC's continuing statutory responsibility for the radiological health and safety of the public.

On January 14, 1980, the two agencies entered into a "Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA to Accomplish a Prompt Improvement in Radiological Emergency Preparedness," that was responsive to the President's December 7, 1979, statement. A revised and updated Memorandum of Understanding became effective November 1, 1980. The MOU was further revised and updated on April 9, 1985. This MOU is a further revision to reflect the evolving relationship between NRC and FEMA and the experience gained in carrying out the provisions of the previous MOU's. This MOU supersedes these two earlier versions of the MOU.

The general principles agreed to in the previous MOU's and reaffirmed in this MOU, are as follows: FEMA coordinates all Federal planning for the offsite impact of radiological emergencies and takes the lead for assessing offsite radiological emergency response plansand preparedness, makes findings and determinations as to the adequacy and capability of implementing offsite plans, and communicates those findings and determinations to the NRC. The NRC reviews those FEMA findings and determinations in conjunction with the NRC onsite findings for the purpose of making determinations on the overall state of emergency preparedness. These overall findings and determinations are used by NRC to make radiological health and safety decisions in the issuance of licenses and the continued operation of licensed plants to include taking enforcement actions as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors. This delineation of responsibilities avoids duplicative efforts by the NRC staff in offsite preparedness matters. However, if FEMA informs the NRC that an emergency, unforeseen contingency, or other reason would prevent FEMA from providing a requested finding in a reasonable time, then, in consultation with FEMA, the NRC might initiate its own review of offsite emergency preparedness.

A separate MOU dated October 22, 1980, deals with NRC/FEMA cooperation and responsibilities in response to an actual or potential radiological emergency. Operations Response Procedures have been developed that implement the provisions of the Incident Response MOU. These documents are intended to be consistent with the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan which describes the relationships, roles, and responsibilities of Federal Agencies for responding to accidents involving peacetime nuclear emergencies. On December 1, 1991, the NRC and FEMA also concluded a separate MOU in support of Executive Order 12657 (FEMA Assistance in Emergency Preparedness Planning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants).

FEMA-Executive Order 12148 charges the Director, FEMA, with the responsibility to "* * * establish Federal policies for, and coordinate, all civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and assistance functions of Executive agencies" (Section 2-101) and "* * * represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery programs" (Section 2-104.).

On December 7, 1979, the President, in response to the recommendations of the Kemeny Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, directed that FEMA assume lead responsibility for all offsite nuclear emergency planning and response.

Specifically, the FEMA responsibilities with respect to radiological emergency preparedness as they relate to NRC are:

1. To take the lead in offsite emergency planning and to review and assess offsite emergency plans and preparedness for adequacy.

2. To make findings and determinations as to whether offsite emergency plans are adequate and can be implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment). Notwithstanding the procedures which are set forth in 44 CFR part 350 for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings, and determinations on the current status of emergency planning and preparedness around particular sites, referred to as interim findings, will be provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. Such findings will be provided by FEMA on mutually agreed to schedules or on specific NRC request. The request and findings will normally be by written communications between the co-chairs of the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee. An interim finding provided under this arrangement will be an extension of FEMA's procedures for review and approval of offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness set forth in 44 CFR part 350. It will be based on the review of currently available plans and, if appropriate, joint exercise results related to a specific nuclear power plant site.

If the review involves an application under 10 CFR part 52 for an early site permit, the NRC will forward to FEMA pertinent information provided by the applicant and consult with FEMA as to whether there is any significant impediment to the development of offsite emergency plans. As appropriate, depending upon the nature of information provided by the applicant, the NRC will also request that FEMA determine whether major features of offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are acceptable, or whether offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are adequate, as discussed below.

An interim finding based only on the review of currently available offsite plans will include an assessment as to whether these plans are adequate when measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, and, pending a demonstration through an exercise, whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented. The finding will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) Plans are adequate and there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented with only limited or no corrections needed; (2) plans are adequate, but before a determination can be made as to whether they can be implemented, corrections must be made to the plans or supporting measures must be demonstrated (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment) or (3) plans are inadequate and cannot be implemented until they are revised to correct deficiencies noted in the Federal review.

If, in FEMA's view, the plans that are available are not completed or are not ready for review, FEMA will provide NRC with a status report delineating milestones for preparation of the plan by the offsite authorities as well as FEMA's actions to assist in timely development and review of the plans.

An interim finding on preparedness will be based on review of currently available plans and joint exercise results and will include an assessment as to (1) whether offsite emergency plans are adequate as measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1 and (2) whether the exercise(s) demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented.

An interim finding on preparedness will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in an exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision.

3. To assume responsibility, as a supplement to State, local, and utility efforts, for radiological emergency preparedness training of State and local officials.

4. To develop and issue an updated series of interagency assignments which delineate respective agency capabilities and responsibilities and define procedures for coordination and direction for emergency planning and response. [Current assignments are in 44 CFR part 351, March 11, 1982. (47 FR 10758)]

NRC-The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires that the NRC grant licenses only if the health and safety of the public is adequately protected. While the Atomic Energy Act does not specifically require emergency plans and related preparedness measures, the NRC requires consideration of overall emergency preparedness as a part of the licensing process. The NRC rules (10 CFR 50.33, 50.34, 50.47, 50.54, and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, and 10 CFR part 52) include requirements for the licensee's emergency plans.

Specifically, the NRC responsibilities for radiological emergency preparedness are:

1. To assess licensee emergency plans for adequacy. This review will include organizations with whom licensees have written agreements to provide onsite support services under emergency conditions.

2. To verify that licensee emergency plans are adequately implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment).

3. To review the FEMA findings and determinations as to whether offsite plans are adequate and can be implemented.

4. To make radiological health and safety decisions with regard to the overall state of emergency preparedness (i.e., integration of emergency preparedness onsite as determined by the NRC and offsite as determined by FEMA and reviewed by NRC) such as assurance for continued operation, for issuance of operating licenses, or for taking enforcement actions, such as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors.

FEMA will provide support to the NRC for licensing reviews related to reactors, fuel facilities, and materials licensees with regard to the assessment of the adequacy of offsite radiological emergency response plans and preparedness. This will include timely submittal of an evaluation suitable for inclusion in NRC safety evaluation reports.

Substantially prior to the time that a FEMA evaluation is required with regard to fuel facility or materials license review, NRC will identify those fuel and materials licensees with potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases and transmit a request for review to FEMA as the emergency plans are completed.

FEMA routine support will include providing assessments, findings and determinations (interim and final) on offsite plans and preparedness related to reactor license reviews. To support its findings and determinations, FEMA will make expert witnesses available before the Commission, the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, NRC hearing boards and administrative law judges, for any court actions, and during any related discovery proceedings.

FEMA will appear in NRC licensing proceedings as part of the presentation of the NRC staff. FEMA counsel will normally present FEMA witnesses and be permitted, at the discretion of the NRC licensing board, to cross-examine the witnesses of parties, other than the NRC witnesses, on matters involving FEMA findings and determinations, policies, or operations; however, FEMA will not be asked to testify on status reports. FEMA is not a party to NRC proceedings and, therefore, is not subject to formal discovery requirements placed upon parties to NRC proceedings. Consistent with available resources, however, FEMA will respond informally to discovery requests by parties. Specific assignment of professional responsibilities between NRC and FEMA counsel will be primarily the responsibility of the attorneys assigned to a particular case. In situations where questions of professional responsibility cannot be resolved by the attorneys assigned, resolution of any differences will be made by the General Counsel of FEMA and the General Counsel of the NRC or their designees. NRC will request the presiding Board to place FEMA on the service list for all litigation in which it is expected to participate.

Nothing in this MOU shall be construed in any way to diminish NRC's responsibility for protecting the radiological health and safety of the public.

NRC will assist in the development and review of offsite plans and preparedness through its membership on the Regional Assistance Committees (RAC). FEMA will chair the Regional Assistance Committees. Consistent with NRC's statutory responsibility, NRC will recognize FEMA as the interface with State and local governments for interpreting offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness criteria as they affect those governments and for reporting to those governments the results of any evaluation of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness.

Where questions arise concerning the interpretation of the criteria, such questions will continue to be referred to FEMA Headquarters, and when appropriate, to the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee to assure uniform interpretation.

FEMA and NRC will cooperate in determining exercise requirements for licensees, and State and local governments. They will also jointly observe and evaluate exercises. NRC and FEMA will institute procedures to enhance the review of objectives and scenarios for joint exercises. This review is to assure that both the onsite considerations of NRC and the offsite considerations of FEMA are adequately addressed and integrated in a manner that will provide for a technically sound exercise upon which an assessment of preparedness capabilities can be based. The NRC/FEMA procedures will provide for the availability of exercise objectives and scenarios sufficiently in advance of scheduled exercises to allow enough time for adequate review by NRC and FEMA and correction of any deficiencies by the licensee. The failure of a licensee to develop a scenario that adequately addresses both onsite and offsite considerations may result in NRC taking enforcement actions.

The FEMA reports will be a part of an interim finding on emergency preparedness; or will be the result of an exercise conducted pursuant to FEMA's review and approval procedures under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC's requirement under 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, Section IV.F. Exercise evaluations will identify one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in the exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision. The schedule for issuance of the draft and final exercise reports will be as shown in FEMA-REP-14 (Radiological Emergency Preparedness Exercise Manual).

The deficiency referred to in (2) above is defined as an observed or identified inadequacy of organizational performance in an exercise that could cause a finding that offsite emergency preparedness is not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Because of the potential impact of deficiencies on emergency preparedness, they should be corrected within 120 days through appropriate remedial actions, including remedial exercises, drills, or other actions.

Where there are deficiencies of the types noted above, and when there is a potential for remedial actions, FEMA Headquarters will promptly (1-2 days) discuss these with NRC Headquarters. Within 10 days of the exercise, official notification of identified deficiencies will be made by FEMA to the State, NRC Headquarters, and the RAC with an information copy to the licensee. NRC will formally notify the licensee of the deficiencies and monitor the licensee's efforts to work with State and local authorities to correct the deficiencies. Approximately 60 days after official notification of the deficiency, the NRC, in consultation with FEMA, will assess the progress being made toward resolution of the deficiencies.

If FEMA determines under 44 CFR 350.13 of its regulations that offsite emergency plans or preparedness are not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public, FEMA shall, as described in its rule, withdraw approval.

Upon receiving notification of such action from FEMA, the NRC will promptly review FEMA's findings and determinations and formally document the NRC's position. When, as described in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii) and 50.54(s)(3) of its regulations, the NRC finds the state of emergency preparedness does not provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency, the NRC will notify the affected licensee accordingly and start the "120-day clock."

NRC has lead responsibility for the development of emergency planning and preparedness guidance for licensees. FEMA has lead responsibility for the development of radiological emergency planning and preparedness guidance for State and local agencies. NRC and FEMA recognize the need for an integrated, coordinated approach to radiological emergency planning and preparedness by NRC licensees and State and local governments. NRC and FEMA will each, therefore, provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on such guidance (including interpretations of agreed joint guidance) prior to adoption as formal agency guidance.

FEMA and NRC will each provide the other with continued access to those automatic data processing support systems which contain relevant emergency preparedness data.

Ongoing NRC and FEMA research and development programs that are related to State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness will be coordinated. NRC and FEMA will each provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on relevant research and development programs prior to implementing them.

FEMA will take the lead in developing public information and educational programs. NRC will assist FEMA by reviewing for accuracy educational materials concerning radiation, and its hazards and information regarding appropriate actions to be taken by the general public in the event of an accident involving radioactive materials.

Disasters that destroy roads, buildings, communications, transportation resources or other offsite infrastructure in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant can degrade the capabilities of offsite response organizations in the 10-mile plume emergency planning zone. Examples of events that could cause such devastation are hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, major fires, large explosions, and riots.

If a disaster damages the area around a licensed operating nuclear power plant to an extent that FEMA seriously questions the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness, FEMA will inform the NRC promptly. Likewise, the NRC will inform FEMA promptly of any information it receives from licensees, its inspectors, or others, that raises serious questions about the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness. If FEMA concludes that a disaster-initiated review of offsite radiological emergency preparedness is necessary to determine if offsite emergency preparedness is still adequate, it will inform the NRC in writing, as soon as practicable, including a schedule for conduct of the review. FEMA will also give the NRC (1) interim written reports of its findings, as appropriate, and (2) a final written report on the results of its review.

The disaster-initiated review is performed to reaffirm the radiological emergency preparedness capabilities of affected offsite jurisdictions located in the 10-mile emergency planning zone and is not intended to be a comprehensive review of offsite plans and preparedness.

The NRC will consider information provided by FEMA Headquarters and pertinent findings from FEMA's disaster-initiated review in making decisions regarding the restart or continued operation of an affected operating nuclear power reactor. The NRC will notify FEMA Headquarters, in writing, of the schedule for restart of an affected reactor and keep FEMA Headquarters informed of changes in that schedule.

The NRC/FEMA Steering Committee on Emergency Preparedness will continue to be the focal point for coordination of emergency planning and preparedness. As discussed in Section I of this agreement, response activities between these two agencies are addressed in a separate MOU. The Steering Committee will consist of an equal number of members to represent each agency with one vote per agency. When the Steering Committee cannot agree on the resolution of an issue, the issue will be referred to NRC and FEMA management. The NRC members will have lead responsibility for licensee planning and preparedness and the FEMA members will have lead responsibility for offsite planning and preparedness. The Steering Committee will assure coordination of plans and preparedness evaluation activities and revise, as necessary, acceptance criteria for licensee, State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness. NRC and FEMA will then consider and adopt criteria, as appropriate, in their respective jurisdictions. (See Attachment 1).

A. The normal point of contact for implementation of the points in this MOU will be the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.

B. The Steering Committee will establish the day-to-day procedures for assuring that the arrangements of this MOU are carried out.

A. This MOU shall be effective as of date of signature and shall continue in effect unless terminated by either party upon 30 days notice in writing.

B. Amendments or modifications to this MOU may be made upon written agreement by both parties.

Approved for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Dated: June 17, 1993.

Dated: June 17, 1993.

Approved for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Assure coordination of efforts to maintain and improve emergency planning and preparedness for nuclear power reactors as described in the NRC and FEMA rules and the NRC/FEMA MOU on Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness. Coordinate consistent criteria for licensee, State and local emergency plans and preparedness.

The NRC and FEMA consignees of this MOU will designate respective co-chairs for the Steering Committee. The designated co-chairs will, in turn, appoint their respective members to the Committee.

Changes to the membership of the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee may be made by the co-chairs representing the agency whose member is being changed.

The Steering Committee will maintain a record of each meeting to include identification of issues discussed and conclusions reached. No meeting will be held without the attendance and participation of at least the co-chairs or two assigned members of each agency.

When items involving responsibilities of other NRC or FEMA offices are discussed, the affected offices will be contacted as appropriate.

#### PART 354 - FEE FOR SERVICES TO SUPPORT FEMA'S OFFSITE RADIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM

##### § 354.1 Purpose.

This part establishes the methodology for FEMA to assess and collect user fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees of commercial nuclear power plants to recover at least 100 percent of the amounts that we anticipate to obligate for our Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program as authorized under Title III, Public Law 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2502. Public Law 105-276 established in the Treasury a Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund, to be available under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et. seq.), and under Executive Order 12657 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 611), for offsite radiological emergency planning, preparedness, and response. Beginning in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, the Administrator of FEMA must publish fees to be assessed and collected, applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. The methodology for assessment and collection of fees must be fair and equitable and must reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological emergency planning, preparedness, response and associated services. Our assessment of fees include our costs for use of agency resources for classes of regulated persons and our administrative costs to collect the fees. Licensees deposit fees by electronic transfer into the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund in the U.S. Treasury as offsetting collections.

##### § 354.2 Scope of this regulation.

The regulation in this part applies to all persons or licensees who have applied for or have received from the NRC:

(a) A license to construct or operate a commercial nuclear power plant;

(b) A possession-only license for a commercial nuclear power plant, with the exception of licensees that have received an NRC-approved exemption to 10 CFR 50.54(q) requirements;

(c) An early site permit for a commercial nuclear power plant;

(d) A combined construction permit and operating license for a commercial nuclear power plant; or

(e) Any other NRC licensee that is now or may become subject to requirements for offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness.

###### We, our, us,

means and refers to FEMA.

##### § 354.4 Assessment of fees.

(a)(1) We assess user fees from licensees using a methodology that includes charges for REP Program services provided by both our personnel and our contractors. Beginning in FY 1995, we established a four-year cycle from FY 1995-1998 with predetermined user fee assessments that were collected each year of the cycle. The following six-year cycle will run from FY 1999 through FY 2004. The fee for each site consists of two distinct components:

###### site-specific, biennial exercise-related component

(i) Ato recover the portion of the REP program budget associated only with plume pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ) biennial exercise-related activities. We determine this component by reviewing average biennial exercise-related activities/hours that we use in exercises conducted since the inception of our REP user fee program in 1991. We completed an analysis of REP Program activities/hours used during the FY 1991-1995 cycle at the end of that four-year cycle. We will make adjustments to the site-specific user fees for the next proposed FY 1999-2004 six-year cycle.

###### flat fee component

(ii) Athat is the same for each site and recovers the remaining portion of the REP Program budgeted funding that does not include biennial exercise-related activities.

(2) We will assess fees only for REP Program services provided by our personnel and by our contractors, and we will not assess fees for those services that other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RAC's provide.

###### Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for our personnel.

(b)We will determine an average biennial exercise-related cost for our personnel for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average number of hours spent by our personnel in REP exercise-related activities for each site. We will determine the average number of hours using an analysis of site-specific exercise activity spent since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We determine the actual user fee assessment for this component by multiplying the average number of REP exercise-related hours that we determine and annualize for each site by the average hourly rate in effect for the fiscal year for a REP Program employee. We will revise the hourly rate annually to reflect actual budget and cost of living factors, but the number of annualized, site-specific exercise hours will remain constant for user fee calculations and assessments throughout the six-year cycle. We will continue to track and monitor exercise activity during the six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004. We will make appropriate adjustments to this component to calculate user fee assessments for later six-year cycles.

###### Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for FEMA contract personnel.

(c)We have determined an average biennial exercise-related cost for REP contractors for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average costs of contract personnel in REP site-specific exercise-related activities since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We will continue to track and monitor activity during the initial six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004, and we will make appropriate adjustments to this component for calculation of user fee assessments during subsequent six-year cycles.

###### Determination of flat fee component.

(d)For each year of the six-year cycle, we recover the remainder of REP Program budgeted funds as a flat fee component. Specifically, we determine the flat fee component by subtracting the total of our personnel and contractor site-specific, biennial exercise-related components, as outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the total REP budget for that fiscal year. We then divide the resulting amount equally among the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites (defined under 354.2) to arrive at each site's flat fee component for that fiscal year.

###### Discontinuation of charges.

(e)When we receive a copy from the NRC of their approved exemption to 10 CFR 50.54(q) requirements stating that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness are no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, we will discontinue REP Program services at that site. We will no longer assess a user fee for that site from the beginning of the next fiscal year.

#### PARTS 355-359 [RESERVED]

#### PART 360 - STATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

##### § 360.1 Purpose.

The Emergency Management Training Program is designed to enhance the States' emergency management training program to increase State capabilities and those of local governments in this field, as well as to give States the opportunity to develop new capabilities and techniques. The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.

##### § 360.2 Description of program.

(a) The program is designed for all States regardless of their present level of involvement in training or their degree of expertise in originating and presenting training courses in the past. The needs of individual States, difference in numbers to be trained, and levels of sophistication in any previous training program have been recognized. It is thus believed that all States are best able to meet their own unique situations and those of local government by being given this opportunity and flexibility.

(b) Each State is asked to submit an acceptable application, to be accompanied by a Training and Education (T&E) plan for a total of three years, only the first year of which will be required to be detailed. The remaining two year program should be presented in terms of ongoing training objectives and programs. In the first year plan applicants shall delineate their objectives in training and education, including a description of the programs to be offered, and identify the audiences and numbers to be trained. Additionally, the State is asked to note the month in which the activity is to be presented, the location, and cost estimates including instructional costs and participant's travel and per diem. These specifics of date, place, and costs will be required for the first year of any three year plan. A three year plan will be submitted each year with an application. Each negotiated agreement will include a section of required training (Radiological Defense), and a section including optional courses to be conducted in response to State and local needs.

(c) FEMA support to the States in their training program for State and local officials, has been designed around three Program elements. Each activity listed in the State Training and Education (T&E) Plan will be derived from the following three elements:

###### Government Conducted Courses:

(1)Such courses require the least capability on the part of the State. They are usually conducted through provisions in a FEMA Regional Support Contract and/or FEMA or other Federal agency staff. The State's responsibilities fall primarily into administrative areas of recruiting participants, making all arrangements for the facilities needed for presentation of the course, and the handling of the cost reimbursement to participants, though State staff may participate as instructors. These courses for example include:

(i) Career Development Courses: Phases I, II, and III,

(ii) Radiological Officer and Instructor Courses,

(iii) Technical Workshops on Disaster Recovery or Hazard Mitigation.

###### Government and recipient conducted courses:

(2)Responsibilities in these courses fall jointly upon Federal and State government as agreed in the planning for the course. Courses in this category might include:

(i) Emergency Management Workshops,

(ii) Multijurisdictional Emergency Operations Simulation Training.

###### Recipient conducted courses:

(3)This element requires the greatest degree of sophistication in program planning and delivery on the part of the State. Training events proposed by the State must be justified as addressing Emergency Management Training Program objectives. Additionally, they must address State or community needs and indicate the State's ability to present and carry out the Program of Instruction. Courses in this category could include:

(i) Radiological Monitoring,

(ii) Emergency Operations Simulating Training,

(iii) Shelter Management.

(d) In order that this three year comprehensive Training and Education Program planning can proceed in a timely and logical manner, each State will be provided three target appropriation figures, one for each of the three program years. States will develop their proposals, using the target figure to develop their scope of work. Adjustments in funding and the scope of work will be subject to negotiation before finalization. Both the funding and the scope of work will be reviewed each year and adjustments in the out years will reflect increased sophistication and expertise of the States as well as changing training needs within each State.

(e)(1) FEMA funding through the State Cooperative Agreement for the training activities is to be used for travel and per diem expenses of students selected by the States for courses reflecting individually needed or required training. Additionally funds may be expended for course materials and instructor expenses. The funding provided in the State Cooperative Agreement is not for the purpose of conducting ongoing State activities or for funding staff positions to accomplish work to be performed under this Agreement. Nor is the Agreement for the purpose of purchasing equipment which may be obtained with the help of Personnel and Administrative funds. In cases where equipment has been identified as needed in the scope of work submitted with the application, and where it serves as an outreach to a new audience or methodology, equipment purchase may be approved at the time of initial application approval.

(2) Allowable cost will be funded at 100%.

##### § 360.3 Eligible applicants.

Each of the 50 States, independent commonwealths, and territories is eligible to participate in a State Cooperative Agreement with FEMA. The department, division, or agency of the State government assigned the responsibility for State training in comprehensive emergency management should file the application.

##### § 360.4 Administrative procedures.

###### Award.

(a)Each State desiring to participate will negotiate the amount of financial support for the training and education program. Deciding factors will be the scope of the program, a prudent budget, the number of individuals to be trained, and variety of audiences included which are in need of training. All these factors are part of the required application as discussed in § 360.2.

###### Period of agreement.

(b)Agreements will be negotiated annually and will be in effect for a period of 12 months. Each agreement, however, will include a scope of work for three years as reflected in § 360.2(b) to give continuity to the total training and education program.

###### Submission procedure.

(c)Each State applicant shall comply with the following procedures:

###### Issuance of a request for application:

(1)Each State emergency management agency will receive a Request for Application Package from the State's respective FEMA Regional Administrator.

###### How to submit:

(2)Each State shall submit the completed application package to the Regional Administrator of the Appropriate Region.

###### Application package:

(3)The Application Package should include:

(i) A transmittal letter signed by the State Director of the agency tasked with emergency management responsibilities for that State.

(ii) A three year projected training and education scope of work including both "required" training and "optional" courses. The first of the projected three year program is to be detailed as to list of courses, description of training to be offered, audiences to be reached and numbers to be trained. Dates and locations of training as well as costs of delivery and student travel and per diem are to be estimated. Special instructions for this portion of the submittal will be included in the Application Package.

(iii) Standard Form 270 "Request for Advance or Reimbursement" as required by 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002 and FEMA General Provisions for Cooperative Agreements.

###### Reporting agreements.

(d)Recipients of State Agreement benefits will report quarterly during the Federal Fiscal year, directly to the Regional Administrator of their respective Regions. The report should include a narrative of the training programs conducted accompanied by rosters for each event, agenda, and a summary financial statement on the status of the Agreement funds. Any course or training activity included in the Scope of Work and not presented as scheduled should be explained in detail as to the reason for cancellation in the quarterly report. The costs allocated to this cancelled activity should be reprogrammed to another training activity approved by the Regional Administrator no later than the last day of the 3rd quarter, or released to the Region. An evaluation of the degree to which objectives were met, the effectiveness of the methodology, and the appropriateness of the resources and references used should also be included in the quarterly report. The report is due in the Regional Office no later than the 15th day of January, April, and July. A final report for the year is due the 15th of October.

##### § 360.5 General provisions for State Cooperative Agreement.

The legal funding instrument for the State Assistance Program for Training and Education FEMA is the State Cooperative Agreement. All States will be required to comply with FEMA General Provisions for the State Cooperative Agreement. The General Provisions for the State Cooperative Agreement will be provided to the States as part of the Request for Application package. The General Provisions will become part of the Cooperative Agreement.

#### PART 361 - NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS REDUCTION ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

##### Subpart A - Earthquake Hazards Reduction Assistance Program

###### § 361.1 Purpose.

This part prescribes the policies to be followed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and States in the administration of FEMA's earthquake hazards reduction assistance program, and establishes the criteria for cost-sharing.

###### § 361.2 Definitions.

####### Cash Contribution

means the State cash outlay (expenditure), including the outlay of money contributed to the State by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. All expenditures must be listed in the project's approved budget.

####### Certification

represents the Governor's written assurance describing the steps State agencies will take toward meeting the 50 percent cash contribution required following the third year of program funding. The letter of certification is intended to assist the State maintain a commitment to and plan for securing the future cash match with the long-range goal of developing an ongoing, rather than a short-term, State program.

####### Cost Sharing,Matching

andrepresent that portion of project costs not borne by the Federal Government.

####### Eligible Activities

are activities for which FEMA may provide funding to States under this section. They include specific activities or projects related to earthquake hazards reduction which fall into one or more of the following categories: Preparedness and response planning; mitigation planning and implementation, including inventories preparation, seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety; and public awareness and education. The activities that will actually be funded shall be determined through individual negotiations between FEMA and the States (see criteria in § 361.3(3)).

####### In-kind contributions

represent the value of non-cash contributions provided by the States and other non-Federal parties. In-kind contributions may be in the form of charges for real property and non-expendable personal property and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the States' earthquake hazards reduction projects.

####### Project

means the complete set of approved earthquake hazards reduction activities undertaken by a State, or other jurisdiction, on a cost-shared basis with FEMA in a given Federal fiscal year.

####### Project Period

is the duration of time over which an earthquake hazards reduction project is implemented.

####### State

refers to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States. It also means local units of government or substate areas that include a number of local government jurisdictions.

####### State Assistance

means the funding provided under this subpart by FEMA through the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) to States to develop State programs specifically related to earthquake hazards reduction. The term also includes assistance to local units of government or substate areas, such as a group of several counties.

####### Target Allocation

is the maximum amount of FEMA earthquake program funds presumably available to an eligible State in a fiscal year. It is based primarily upon the total amount of State assistance funds available to FEMA annually, the number of eligible States, and a nationally standardized comparison of these States' seismic hazard and population-at-risk. The target allocation is not necessarily the amount of funding that a State will actually receive from FEMA. Rather, it represents a planning basis of negotiations between the State and its FEMA Regional Office which will ultimately determine the actual amount of earthquake State assistance to be provided by FEMA.

###### § 361.3 Project description.

(a) An objective of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act is to develop, in areas of seismic risk, improved understanding of and capability with respect to earthquake-related issues, including methods of mitigating earthquake damage, planning to prevent or minimize earthquake damage, disseminating warnings of earthquakes, organizing emergency services, and planning for post-earthquake recovery. To achieve this objective, FEMA has implemented an earthquake hazards reduction assistance program for State and local governments in seismic risk areas.

(b) This assistance program provides funding for earthquake hazards reduction activities which are eligible according to the definition in § 361.2. The categories, or program elements, listed therein comprise a comprehensive earthquake hazards reduction project for any given seismic hazard area. Key aspects of each of these elements are as follows:

####### Mitigation

(1)involves developing and implementing strategies for reducing losses from earthquakes by incorporating principles of seismic safety into public and private decisions regarding the siting, design, and construction of structures (i.e., updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety), and regarding buildings' nonstructural elements, contents and furnishings. Mitigation includes preparing inventories of and conducting seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, and developing plans for identifying and retrofitting existing structures that pose threats to life or would suffer major damage in the event of a serious earthquake.

####### Preparedness/response planning

(2)are closely related and usually considered as one comprehensive activity. They do differ, however, in that preparedness planning involves those efforts undertaken before an earthquake to prepare for or improve capability to respond to the event, while response planning can be defined as the planning necessary to implement an effective response once the earthquake has occurred. Preparedness/response planning usually considers functions related to the following:

(i) Rescue and fire services;

(ii) Medical services;

(iii) Damage assessments;

(iv) Communications;

(v) Security;

(vi) Restoration of lifeline and utility services;

(vii) Transportation;

(viii) Sheltering, food and water supplies;

(ix) Public health and information services;

(x) Post-disaster recovery and the return of economic stability;

(xi) Secondary impacts, such as dam failures, toxic releases, etc.; and

(xii) Organization and management.

####### Public awareness/earthquake education

(3)activities are designed to increase public awareness of earthquakes and their associated risks, and to stimulate behavioral changes to foster a self-help approach to earthquake preparedness, response, and mitigation. Audiences that may be targeted for such efforts include:

(i) The general public;

(ii) School populations (administrators, teachers, students, and parents);

(iii) Special needs groups (e.g., elderly, disabled, non-English speaking);

(iv) Business and industry;

(v) Engineers, architects, builders;

(vi) The media; and

(vii) Public officials.

####### Other Activities

(4)in support of those listed in § 361.3(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) may include, but are not limited to, State seismic advisory boards which provide State and local officials responsible for implementing earthquake hazards reduction projects with expert advice in a variety of fields; hazard identification which defines the potential for earthquakes and their related geological hazards in a particular area; and vulnerability assessments, also known as loss estimation studies, which provide information on the impacts and consequences of an earthquake on an area's resources, as well as opportunities for earthquake hazards mitigation.

(c) State eligibility for financial assistance to States under this section is determined by FEMA based on a combination of the following criteria:

(1) Seismic hazard, including the historic occurrence of damaging earthquakes, as well as probable seismic activity;

(2) Total population and major urban concentrations exposed to such risk; and

(3) Other factors, the loss, damage, or disruption of which by a severe earthquake would have serious national impacts upon national security, such as industrial concentrations, concentrations or occurrences of natural resources, financial/economic centers and national defense facilities.

(d) Each fiscal year, FEMA will establish a target allocation of earthquake program funds for each eligible State.

(e) The specific activities, and the distribution of funds among them, that will be undertaken with this assistance will be determined during the annual Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement (CCA) negotiations between FEMA and the State, and will be based upon the following:

(1) The availability of information regarding identification of seismic hazards and vulnerability to those hazards;

(2) Earthquake hazards reduction accomplishments of the State to date;

(3) State and Federal priorities for needed earthquake hazards reduction activities; and

(4) State and local capabilities with respect to staffing, professional expertise, and funding.

(f) As a condition of receiving FEMA funding, a percentage of the amount of the total State project (FEMA State assistance, combined with the State match) must be spent for activities under the Mitigation Planning element. The percentage, to be determined by FEMA, may be increased by no more than 5 percent annually, beginning at 15 percent in fiscal year 1991 with a limit of 50 percent of the total State project. The increase will take into account the amount of time a State has been participating in the program. States may expend more than the required percentage of funding on eligible mitigation activities.

(g) The State match may be distributed among the eligible activities in any manner that is mutually agreed upon by FEMA and the State in the CCA negotiations.

(h) Negotiations between FEMA and the State regarding the scope of work and the determination of the amount of State assistance to be awarded shall consider earthquake hazards reduction activities previously accomplished by the State, as well as the quality of their performance.

###### § 361.4 Matching contributions.

(a) All State assistance will be cost shared after the first year of funding. States which received a grant before October 1, 1990, which included the 50 percent non-Federal contribution to the State program, will continue to match the Federal funds on a 50 percent cash match basis.

(b) States which did not receive a grant before October 1, 1990, will assume cost sharing on a phased-in basis over a period of four years with the full cost sharing requirements being implemented in the fourth year. The sequence is as follows:

(1) For the first fiscal year, cost sharing will be voluntary. FEMA will provide State assistance without requiring a State match. Those States that are able to cost-share are encouraged to do so (on either a cash or in-kind basis).

(2) For the second fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 25 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.

(3) For the third fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 35 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.

(4) For the fourth and subsequent fiscal years, full cost sharing will be implemented, requiring a minimum of a 50 percent non-Federal contribution to a State program, with this share required to be cash. In-kind matching will no longer be acceptable. Thus, every dollar FEMA provides to a State must be matched by one dollar from the State. States that can contribute an amount greater than that required by the match are permitted and encouraged to do so. However, State assistance will not exceed the established target allocation.

(c) The State contribution need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of the Federal funds. However, the State full matching share must be obligated by the end of the project period for which the State assistance has been made available for obligation under an approved program or budget.

(d) In the event a State interrupts its participation in this program, if it later elects to participate again, the nature and amount of that State's cost sharing shall be determined by the regulations then in effect, taking into account the number of years in which the State previously participated.

###### § 361.5 Criteria for program assistance, matching contributions, and return of program assistance funds.

(a) In order to qualify for assistance, a State must:

(1) Demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State;

(2) Provide a share of the costs of the activities for which assistance is being given, in accordance with § 361.4; and

(3) Demonstrate that it is taking actions to ensure its ability to meet the 50 percent cash contribution commitment either on an ongoing basis or for new States, by the fourth year of funding.

(i) The Governor of newly participating State must certify to the FEMA Regional Administrator the State will take steps to meet the 50 percent cash contribution requirement after the third year of funding. The specific steps to be taken will be outlined in the certification which must be submitted prior to the State receiving program funds.

(ii) The Governor must certify the State's continued commitment in the second and third years of funding. The certification will describe the progress made on the steps contained in the previous year's certification and steps to be taken in the future. The certification must be submitted to the Regional Administrator before the State will receive program funds.

(iii) If a State encounters difficulties meeting the 50 percent cash contribution requirement for the target allocation following the fourth year of funding, the Regional Administrator may require the Governor to continue certifying the State is working to resolve the difficulty.

(iv) A State will not receive Federal funds if it cannot provide the required cash contribution.

(b) The value of any resources accepted as a matching share under one Federal agreement or program cannot be counted again as a contribution under another.

(c) The State seeking the match shall submit documentation sufficient for FEMA to determine that the contribution meets the following requirements. The match shall be:

(1) Necessary and reasonable for proper, cost-effective and efficient administration of the project, allocable solely thereto, and except as specifically provided herein, not be a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of State and local governments;

(2) Verifiable from the recipient State's records;

(3) Not allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally financed program in either the current or a prior period;

(4) Authorized under State law;

(5) Consistent with any limitations or exclusions set forth in these regulations, Federal laws or other governing limitations as to types of cost items;

(6) Accorded consistent treatment through application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances;

(7) Provided for in the approved budget/workplan of the State; and

(8) Consistent with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.

(d) A State must submit and FEMA must approve a statement of work before the State receives any grant funds. The statement of work and target allocation of funds are based on a 12-month performance period. Except under extenuating circumstances, the funds initially obligated to the State will be based on the amount of time remaining in the performance period at the time the statement of work is approved.

(e) States are expected to perform activities and therefore expend funds on a quarterly basis in accordance with the approved statement of work. At the end of the third quarter, State and FEMA regional office staff will review the State's accomplishments to date. Funds not expended in accordance with the approved statement of work by the end of the third quarter of the performance period will not be made available to the State unless the State can demonstrate, and FEMA approves, its ability to perform activities adequately resulting in the expenditure of the funds by the end of the performance period.

###### § 361.6 Documentation of matching contributions.

(a) The statement of work provided by the State to FEMA describing the specific activities comprising its earthquake hazards reduction project, including the project budget, shall reflect a level of effort commensurate with the total of the State and FEMA contributions.

(b) The basis by which the State determines the value of an in-kind match must be documented and a copy retained as part of the official record.

(c) The State shall maintain all records pertaining to matching contributions for a three-year period after the date of submission of the final financial report required by the CCA, or date of audit, whichever date comes first.

###### § 361.7 General eligible expenditures.

(a) Expenditures must be for activities described in the statement of work mutually agreed to by FEMA and the State during the annual negotiation process, or for activities that the State agrees to perform as a result of subsequent modifications to that statement of work. These activities shall be consistent with the definition of eligible activities in § 361.2.

(b) The following is a list of eligible expenditures. When items do not appear on the list they will be considered on a case-by-case basis for policy determinations, based on criteria set forth in § 361.5. All costs must be reasonable, and consistent with OMB Circular A-87.

(1) Direct and indirect salaries or wages (including overtime) of employees hired specifically for carrying out earthquake hazards reduction activities are eligible when engaged in the performance of eligible work.

(2) Reasonable costs for work performed by private contractors on eligible projects contracted for by the State.

(3) Travel costs and per diem costs of State employees not to exceed the actual subsistence expense basis for the permanent or temporary activity, as determined by the State's cost principles governing travel.

(4) Non-expendable personal property, office supplies, and supplies for workshops; exhibits.

(5) A maximum of $8,000 or 10 percent of the total project allocation, whichever is less, may be expended for personal computer equipment in the first year of program funding. A full-time earthquake staff person must be employed and the equipment must be dedicated entirely to the earthquake project.

(6) Meetings and conferences, when the primary purpose is dissemination of information relating to the earthquake hazards reduction project.

(7) Training which directly benefits the conduct of earthquake hazards reduction activities.

###### § 361.8 Ineligible expenditures.

(a) Expenditures for anything defined as an unallowable cost by OMB Circular A-87.

(b) Federal funds may not be used for the purchase or rental of any equipment such as radio/telephone communications equipment, warning systems, and computers and other related information processing equipment, except as stated in § 361.7(b)(5). If a State wishes to use its matching funds for this purpose, it must:

(1) Document during the annual negotiation process with FEMA how this equipment will support the earthquake hazards reduction activities in its scope of work (see § 361.7(a)); and

(2) Claim as credit for its match, if the equipment is to be used for purposes in addition to support of earthquake hazards reduction activities, only that proportion of costs directly related to its earthquake hazards reduction project.

### PART 400 [RESERVED]

### PART 401 - SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS (T-1)

#### § 401.1 Prohibited transportation and discharge.

No person shall transport in any ship documented under the laws of the United States or in any aircraft registered under the laws of the United States any commodity at the time not identified by the Symbol B in the last column of the Commodity Control List (339.1 of the Comprehensive Export Schedule, issued by the Bureau of International Commerce, Department of Commerce (15 CFR parts 368 through 399), any article designated as arms, ammunition, and implements of war in the United States Munitions List (22 CFR parts 121 through 128), or any commodity, including fissionable, materials controlled for export under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to any destination at the time in country groups X, Y, or Z as set forth in the Comprehensive Export Schedule (15 CFR 370.1(g)(2)), and no person shall discharge from any such ship or any such aircraft any such commodity or article at any such port or place or at any other port or place in transit to any such destination, unless a validated export license under the Export Control Act of 1949, as amended, under section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, has been obtained for the shipment, or unless authorization for the shipment has been obtained from the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business. This prohibition applies to the owner of the ship or aircraft, the master of the ship or aircraft, or any other officer, employee or agent of the owner of the ship or aircraft who participates in the transportation. The consular officers of the United States are furnished with current copies of the Commodity Control List.

#### § 401.2 Application for adjustment or exceptions.

Any person affected by any provisions of this order may file an application for an adjustment or exception upon the ground that such provision works an exceptional hardship upon him, not suffered by others, or that its enforcement against him would not be in the interest of the national defense program. Such an application may be made by letter or telegram addressed to the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC, 20230, reference T-1. If authorization is requested, any such application should specify in detail the material to be shipped, the name and address of the shipper and of the recipient of the shipment, the ports or places from which and to which the shipment is being made and the use to which the material shipped will be put. The application should also specify in detail the facts which support the applicant's claim for an exception.

#### § 401.3 Reports.

Persons subject to this order shall submit such reports to the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business as he shall require, subject to the terms of the Federal Reports Act.

#### § 401.4 Records.

Each person participating in any transaction covered by this order shall retain in his possession, for at least 2 years, records of shipments in sufficient detail to permit an audit that determines for each transaction that the provisions of this order have been met. This does not specify any particular accounting method and does not require alteration of the system of records customarily maintained, provided such records supply an adequate basis for audit. Records may be retained in the form of microfilm or other photographic copies instead of the originals.

#### § 401.5 Defense against claims for damages.

No person shall be held liable for damages or penalties for any default under any contract or order which shall result directly or indirectly from compliance with this order or any provision thereof, notwithstanding that this order or such provision shall thereafter be declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.

#### § 401.6 Violations.

Any person who wilfully violates any provisions of this order or wilfully conceals a material fact or furnishes false information in the course of operation under this order is guilty of a crime and upon conviction may be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. In addition, administrative action may be taken against any such person, denying him the privileges generally accorded under this order.

### PART 402 - SHIPMENTS ON AMERICAN FLAG SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT (T-1, INT. 1)

#### § 402.1 Shipments from the United States.

Transportation Order T-1 applies to shipments from the United States, as well as to shipments from foreign ports, on American flag ships and aircraft.

#### § 402.2 Restricted commodities.

The restrictions of Transportation Order T-1 apply to the transportation or discharge of (a) commodities on the Positive List (15 CFR part 399) (as amended from time to time) of the Comprehensive Export Schedule of the Office of International Trade, Department of Commerce, (b) articles on the list of arms, ammunition and implements of war coming within the meaning of Proclamation No. 2776 of March 26, 1948, and (c) commodities, including fissionable materials, controlled for export under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The restrictions imposed by Transportation Order T-1 do not apply to other commodities, not within these restricted classes at the time of transportation or discharge, even though authorization for the export of the commodity from the United States to the particular destination is required under regulations of the Office of International Trade or under other Federal law or regulation. In this respect, Order T-1 is different from Order T-2 which applies to all commodities destined to Communist China. Order T-1 does not relax or modify any of the requirements of any other regulation or law.

#### § 402.3 Addition of commodities to the Positive List.

Order T-1 applies to the transportation or discharge of commodities which are restricted at the time of transportation or discharge. Accordingly, if a commodity is added to the Positive List while the commodity is being transported on an American flag ship or aircraft, the restrictions of Order T-1 immediately apply and the commodity may not be transported to or discharged at any of the restricted ports or discharged in transit to one of the restricted ports, unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.

#### § 402.4 Calls at restricted ports en route to an unrestricted port with restricted cargo.

Order T-1 does not prohibit an American flag ship or aircraft from going to or calling at one of the restricted ports, even though it has on board a commodity which could not be discharged at that port. (Note, however, that Order T-2 prohibits American flag ships and aircraft from calling at any port or other place in Communist China.) For example, an American flag ship may call at one of the restricted ports (except one in Communist China), even though it has on board the following classes of commodities:

(a) A Positive List commodity manifested to a destination outside the restricted area, with an export license and an export declaration showing the unrestricted destination at the ultimate destination, (b) a Positive List commodity destined for the restricted port of call which cannot be discharged there because there is no export license or authorization from the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business permitting discharge at the restricted port of call, (c) a commodity of any kind destined for Communist China (the transportation and discharge of which is covered by Order T-2). None of these commodities may be discharged at the restricted port of call. Discharge of any of these commodities at the port covered by the restrictions of Order T-1 is prohibited and subject to penalty, regardless of the circumstances under which the discharge of the cargo at the restricted port occurs, unless appropriate authorization is obtained.

#### § 402.5 Forwarding commodities previously shipped.

Order T-1 applies to transportation on or discharge from ships documented under the laws of the United States and aircraft registered under the laws of the United States. These restrictions apply either in the case of a discharge at one of the restricted ports or to discharge at any other port in transit to a restricted destination. The restrictions of Order T-1 do not apply to transportation by foreign carriers, as long as there is no prohibited transportation or discharge by or from a United States flag ship or aircraft after the issuance of Order T-1. Accordingly, if an American flag ship or aircraft, before the issuance of Order T-1, had transported restricted commodities manifested to restricted destinations, and had completed the transportation to a foreign intermediate point and had completed the discharge from the American flag ship or aircraft before the issuance of Order T-1, no violation of that order would have occurred, but Order T-1 would prohibit further shipment on an American flag ship or aircraft unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.

#### § 402.6 Relation to Transportation Order T-2.

Transportation Order T-1 applies to the transportation of commodities to, or in transit to, destinations in Sub-Group A, Hong Kong or Macao. It applies, however, only to commodities on the Positive List of the Office of International Trade, arms and ammunition, and commodities controlled under the Atomic Energy Act (see section 2 of this interpretation). Transportation Order T-2 applies to the transportation of commodities of any kind which are destined to Communist China (Order T-2 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in Communist China). Since Communist China is in Sub-Group A, the restrictions of both orders apply to the transportation of commodities to Communist China or to any other point in transit to Communist China.
