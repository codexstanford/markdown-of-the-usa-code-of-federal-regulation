# Title 2 - Grants and Agreements

## Subtitle A - Office of Management and Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements

### PART 1 - ABOUT TITLE 2 OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND SUBTITLE A

#### Subpart A - Introduction to Title 2 of the CFR

##### § 1.100 Content of this title.

This title contains-

(a) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to Federal agencies on government-wide policies and procedures for the award and administration of grants and agreements; and

(b) Federal agency regulations implementing that OMB guidance.

##### § 1.105 Organization and subtitle content.

(a) This title is organized into two subtitles.

(b) The OMB guidance described in § 1.100(a) is published in subtitle A. Publication of the OMB guidance in the CFR does not change its nature-it is guidance and not regulation.

(c) Each Federal agency that publishes regulations implementing the OMB guidance has a chapter in subtitle B in which it issues those regulations. The Federal agency regulations in subtitle B differ in nature from the OMB guidance in subtitle A because the OMB guidance is not regulatory (Federal agency regulations in subtitle B may give regulatory effect to the OMB guidance, to the extent that the agency regulations require compliance with all or portions of the guidance).

##### § 1.110 Issuing authorities.

OMB issues this subtitle. Each Federal agency that has a chapter in subtitle B of this title issues that chapter.

#### Subpart B - Introduction to Subtitle A

##### § 1.200 Purpose of chapters I and II.

(a) Chapters I and II of subtitle A provide OMB guidance to Federal agencies that helps ensure consistent and uniform government-wide policies and procedures for management of the agencies' grants and agreements.

(b) There are two chapters for publication of the guidance because portions of it may be revised as a result of ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify requirements for the award and administration of grants and other financial assistance (and thereby implement the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, Pub. L. 106-107).

(c) The OMB guidance in its initial form-before completion of revisions described in paragraph (b) of this section-is published in chapter II of this subtitle. When revisions to a part of the guidance are finalized, that part is published in chapter I and removed from chapter II.

##### § 1.205 Applicability to grants and other funding instruments.

The types of instruments that are subject to the guidance in this subtitle vary from one portion of the guidance to another (note that each part identifies the types of instruments to which it applies). All portions of the guidance apply to grants and cooperative agreements, some portions also apply to other types of financial assistance or nonprocurement instruments, and some portions also apply to procurement contracts. For example, the:

(a) Guidance on debarment and suspension in part 180 of this subtitle applies broadly to all financial assistance and other nonprocurement transactions, and not just to grants and cooperative agreements.

(b) Cost principles in parts 220, 225 and 230 of this subtitle apply to procurement contracts, as well as to financial assistance, although those principles are implemented for procurement contracts through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in title 48 of the CFR, rather than through Federal agency regulations on grants and agreements in this title.

##### § 1.210 Applicability to Federal agencies and others.

(a) This subtitle contains guidance that directly applies only to Federal agencies.

(b) The guidance in this subtitle may affect others through each Federal agency's implementation of the guidance, portions of which may apply to-

(1) The agency's awarding or administering officials;

(2) Non-Federal entities that receive or apply for the agency's grants or agreements or receive subawards under those grants or agreements; or

(3) Any other entities involved in agency transactions subject to the guidance in this chapter.

##### § 1.215 Relationship to previous issuances.

Although some of the guidance was organized differently within OMB circulars or other documents, much of the guidance in this subtitle existed prior to the establishment of title 2 of the CFR. Specifically:

##### § 1.220 Federal agency implementation of this subtitle.

A Federal agency that awards grants and agreements subject to the guidance in this subtitle implements the guidance in agency regulations in subtitle B of this title and/or in policy and procedural issuances, such as internal instructions to the agency's awarding and administering officials. An applicant or recipient would see the effect of that implementation in the organization and content of the agency's announcements of funding opportunities and in its award terms and conditions.

##### § 1.230 Maintenance of this subtitle.

OMB issues guidance in this subtitle after publication in theAny portion of the guidance that has a potential impact on the public is published with an opportunity for public comment.

#### Subpart C - Responsibilities of OMB and Federal Agencies

##### § 1.300 OMB responsibilities.

OMB is responsible for:

(a) Issuing and maintaining the guidance in this subtitle, as described in § 1.230.

(b) Interpreting the policy requirements in this subtitle.

(c) Reviewing Federal agency regulations implementing the requirements of this subtitle, as required by Executive Order 12866.

(d) Conducting broad oversight of government-wide compliance with the guidance in this subtitle.

(e) Performing other OMB functions specified in this subtitle.

##### § 1.305 Federal agency responsibilities.

The head of each Federal agency that awards and administers grants and agreements subject to the guidance in this subtitle is responsible for:

(a) Implementing the guidance in this subtitle.

(b) Ensuring that the agency's components and subcomponents comply with the agency's implementation of the guidance.

(c) Performing other functions specified in this subtitle.

### Chapter I - Office of Management and Budget Governmentwide Guidance for Grants and Agreements

#### PARTS 2-24 [RESERVED]

#### PART 25 - UNIVERSAL IDENTIFIER AND SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 25.100 Purposes of this part.

This part provides guidance to Federal awarding agencies to establish:

(a) The unique entity identifier as a universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct subrecipients, and;

(b) The System for Award Management (SAM) as the repository for standard information about applicants and recipients.

###### § 25.105 Types of awards to which this part applies.

This part applies to a Federal awarding agency's grants, cooperative agreements, loans, and other types of Federal financial assistance as defined in § 25.406.

###### § 25.110 Exceptions to this part.

####### General.

(a)Through a Federal awarding agency's implementation of the guidance in this part, this part applies to all applicants and recipients of Federal awards, other than those exempted by statute or exempted in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that apply for or receive agency awards.

####### Exceptions for individuals.,i.e.,

(b)None of the requirements in this part apply to an individual who applies for or receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person (unrelated to any business or nonprofit organization he or she may own or operate in his or her name).

####### Other exceptions.

(c)(1) Under a condition identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a Federal awarding agency may exempt an applicant or recipient from an applicable requirement to obtain a unique entity identifier and register in the SAM, or both.

####### USAspending.gov

(i) In that case, the Federal awarding agency must use a generic unique entity identifier in data it reports toif reporting for a prime award to the recipient is required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (Pub. L. 109-282, hereafter cited as "Transparency Act").

(ii) Federal awarding agency use of a generic unique entity identifier should be used rarely for prime award reporting because it prevents prime awardees from being able to fulfill the subaward or executive compensation reporting required by the Transparency Act.

(2) The conditions under which a Federal awarding agency may exempt an applicant or recipient are-

(i) For any applicant or recipient, if the Federal awarding agency determines that it must protect information about the entity from disclosure if it is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, or to avoid jeopardizing the personal safety of the applicant or recipient's staff or clients.

(ii) For a foreign organization or foreign public entity applying for or receiving a Federal award or subaward for a project or program performed outside the United States valued at less than $25,000, if the Federal awarding agency deems it to be impractical for the entity to comply with the requirement(s). This exemption must be determined by the Federal awarding agency on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach and does not apply if subawards are anticipated.

(iii) For an applicant, if the Federal awarding agency makes a determination that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a unique entity identifier and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal awarding agencies must require the recipient to obtain a unique entity identifier and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the Federal award date.

(3) Federal awarding agencies' use of generic unique entity identifier, as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, should be rare. Having a generic unique entity identifier limits a recipient's ability to use Governmentwide systems that are needed to comply with some reporting requirements.

####### Class exceptions.

(d)OMB may allow exceptions for classes of Federal awards, applicants, and recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute.

##### Subpart B - Policy

###### § 25.200 Requirements for notice of funding opportunities, regulations, and application instructions.

(a) Each Federal awarding agency that awards the types of Federal financial assistance defined in § 25.406 must include the requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section in each notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance containing instructions for applicants that is issued on or after August 13, 2020.

(b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that applies and does not have an exemption under § 25.110 to:

(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;

(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information, including information on a recipient's immediate and highest level owner and subsidiaries, as well as on all predecessors that have been awarded a Federal contract or grant within the last three years, if applicable, at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency; and

(3) Provide its unique entity identifier in each application or plan it submits to the Federal awarding agency.

(c) For purposes of this policy:

(1) The applicant meets the Federal awarding agency's eligibility criteria and has the legal authority to apply and to receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a unique entity identifier. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal awarding agency program but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the unique entity identifier of the lead applicant will be used.

(2) A notice of funding opportunity is any paper or electronic issuance that an agency uses to announce a funding opportunity, whether it is called a "program announcement," "notice of funding availability," "broad agency announcement," "research announcement," "solicitation," or some other term.

(3) To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the applicant is required to review and update its information in the SAM database on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

###### § 25.205 Effect of noncompliance with a requirement to obtain a unique entity identifier or register in the SAM.

(a) A Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award or financial modification to an existing Federal award to an applicant or recipient until the entity has complied with the requirements described in § 25.200 to provide a valid unique entity identifier and maintain an active SAM registration with current information (other than any requirement that is not applicable because the entity is exempted under § 25.110).

(b) At the time a Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, if the intended recipient has not complied with an applicable requirement to provide a unique entity identifier or maintain an active SAM registration with current information, the Federal awarding agency:

(1) May determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award; and

(2) May use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant.

###### § 25.210 Authority to modify agency application forms or formats.

To implement the policies in §§ 25.200 and 25.205, a Federal awarding agency may add a unique entity identifier field to information collections previously approved by OMB, without having to obtain further approval to add the field.

###### § 25.215 Requirements for agency information systems.

Each Federal awarding agency that awards Federal financial assistance (as defined in § 25.406) must ensure that systems processing information related to the Federal awards, and other systems as appropriate, are able to accept and use the unique entity identifier as the universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants and recipients.

###### § 25.220 Use of award term.

(a) To accomplish the purposes described in § 25.100, a Federal awarding agency must include in each Federal award (as defined in § 25.405) the award term in appendix A to this part.

(b) A Federal awarding agency may use different letters and numbers than those in appendix A to this part to designate the paragraphs of the Federal award term, if necessary, to conform the system of paragraph designations with the one used in other terms and conditions in the Federal awarding agency's Federal awards.

##### Subpart C - Recipient Requirements of Subrecipients

###### § 25.300 Requirement for recipients to ensure subrecipients have a unique entity identifier.

(a) A recipient may not make a subaward to a subrecipient unless that subrecipient has obtained and provided to the recipient a unique entity identifier. Subrecipients are not required to complete full SAM registration to obtain a unique entity identifier.

(1) The award official shall list the excepted materials in the award; and

(2) The head of the Federal department or agency shall publish a notice in thewithin two weeks after the determination is made, unless the item has already been determined to be domestically nonavailable. A list of items that are not domestically available is at 48 CFR 25.104(a). Thenotice or information from the notice may be posted by OMB to Recovery.gov. The notice shall include-

(i) The title "Buy American Exception under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009";

(ii) The dollar value and brief description of the project; and

(iii) A detailed written justification as to why the restriction is being waived.

###### § 176.90 Acquisitions covered under international agreements.

Section 1605(d) of the Recovery Act provides that the Buy American requirement in section 1605 shall be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements.

(a) The Buy American requirement set out in § 176.70 shall not be applied where the iron, steel, or manufactured goods used in the project are from a Party to an international agreement, listed in paragraph (b) of this section, and the recipient is required under an international agreement, described in the appendix to this subpart, to treat the goods and services of that Party the same as domestic goods and services. As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more and projects that are not specifically excluded from the application of those agreements.

(a) The head of the Federal department or agency involved may make a determination regarding inapplicability of section 1605 to a particular case or to a category of cases.

(b) Before Recovery Act funds are awarded by the Federal agency or obligated by the recipient for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work, an applicant or recipient may request from the award official a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act for specifically identified items.

(c) The time for submitting the request and the information and supporting data that must be included in the request are to be specified in the agency's and recipient's request for applications and/or proposals, and as appropriate, in other written communications. The content of those communications should be consistent with the notice in § 176.150 or § 176.170, whichever applies.

(d) The award official must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.

(e) In making a determination based on the increased cost to the project of using domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, the award official must compare the total estimated cost of the project using foreign iron, steel and/or relevant manufactured goods to the estimated cost if all domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods were used. If use of domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods would increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent, then the award official shall determine that the cost of the domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods is unreasonable.

###### § 176.110 Evaluating proposals of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

(a) If the award official receives a request for an exception based on the cost of certain domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods being unreasonable, in accordance with § 176.80, then the award official shall apply evaluation factors to the proposal to use such foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods as follows:

(1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total estimated cost of the project, if the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods are to be used in the project based on an exception for unreasonable cost requested by the applicant.

(2) Total evaluated cost = project cost estimate + (.25 x project cost estimate, if paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies).

(b) Applicants or recipients also may submit alternate proposals based on use of equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods to avoid possible denial of Recovery Act funding for the proposal if the Federal Government determines that an exception permitting use of the foreign item(s) does not apply.

(c) If the award official makes an award to an applicant that proposed foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods not listed in the applicable notice in the request for applications or proposals, then the award official must add the excepted materials to the list in the award term.

###### § 176.120 Determinations on late requests.

(a) If a recipient requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act after obligating Recovery Act funds for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair (late request), the recipient must explain why it could not request the determination before making the obligation or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the award official concludes that the recipient should have made the request before making the obligation, the award official may deny the request.

(b) The award official must base evaluation of any late request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act on information required by § 176.150(c) and (d) or § 176.170(c) and (d) and/or other readily available information.

(c) If a determination, under § 176.80 is made after Recovery Act funds were obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official must amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis of the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods the award official shall adjust the award amount or the budget, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in § 176.110(a).

###### § 176.130 Noncompliance.

The award official must-

(a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act;

(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the recipient of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and

(c) If the review reveals that a recipient or subrecipient has used foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:

(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act in accordance with § 176.120.

(2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

(3) If removal and replacement of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in a public building or a public work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Federal Government, the award official may determine in writing that the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not affect the Federal Government's right to reduce the amount of the award by the cost of the steel, iron, or manufactured goods that are used in the project or to take enforcement or termination action in accordance with the agency's grants management regulations.

(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate remedies, such as withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency, suspending or terminating the award, and withholding further awards for the project. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with the agency's debarment rule implementing 2 CFR part 180. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.

(2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award amount or redistribute budgeted funds by at least the differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).

(3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods is noncompliant with section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

(b)(1) The award term and condition described in this section implements-

(i) Section 1605(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act), by requiring that all iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States; and

(ii) Section 1605(d), which requires application of the Buy American requirement in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. The restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act do not apply to designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. The Buy American requirement in section 1605 shall not be applied where the iron, steel or manufactured goods used in the project are from a Party to an international agreement that obligates the recipient to treat the goods and services of that Party the same as domestic goods and services. As of January 1, 2010, this obligation shall only apply to projects with an estimated value of $7,804,000 or more.

(2) The recipient shall use only domestic or designated country iron, steel, and manufactured goods in performing the work funded in whole or part with this award, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.

(3) The requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to the iron, steel, and manufactured goods listed by the Federal Government as follows:

(4) The award official may add other iron, steel, and manufactured goods to the list in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the Federal Government determines that-

(i) The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods would be unreasonable. The cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in the project is unreasonable when the cumulative cost of such material will increase the overall cost of the project by more than 25 percent;

(ii) The iron, steel, and/or manufactured good is not produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality; or

(iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery Act would be inconsistent with the public interest.

####### Request for determination of inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American Act.

(c)(1)(i) Any recipient request to use foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall include adequate information for Federal Government evaluation of the request, including-

(A) A description of the foreign and domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods;

(B) Unit of measure;

(C) Quantity;

(D) Cost;

(E) Time of delivery or availability;

(F) Location of the project;

(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and

(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed cost comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this section.

(iii) The cost of iron, steel, or manufactured goods shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty.

(iv) Any recipient request for a determination submitted after Recovery Act funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair shall explain why the recipient could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before the funds were obligated. If the recipient does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the award official need not make a determination.

(2) If the Federal Government determines after funds have been obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official will amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods.. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of the domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods, the award official shall adjust the award amount or redistribute budgeted funds, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in 2 CFR 176.110(a).

(3) Unless the Federal Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods other than designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods is noncompliant with the applicable Act.

####### Data.

(d)To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (b) of this section based on unreasonable cost, the applicant shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:

###### § 176.170 Notice of Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods (covered under International Agreements) - Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

####### Definitions. Designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured good, manufactured good, public building,public work,steel

(a)and, and, as used in this provision, are defined in 2 CFR 176.160(a).

####### Requests for determinations of inapplicability.

(b)A prospective applicant requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) should submit the request to the award official in time to allow a determination before submission of applications or proposals. The prospective applicant shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by 2 CFR 176.160 (c) and (d) in the request. If an applicant has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act before submitting its application or proposal, or has not received a response to a previous request, the applicant shall include the information and supporting data in the application or proposal.

####### Evaluation of project proposals.

(c)If the Federal Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods applies, the Federal Government will evaluate a project requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act by adding to the estimated total cost of the project 25 percent of the project cost if foreign iron, steel, or manufactured goods are used based on unreasonable cost of comparable domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods.

####### Alternate project proposals.

(d)(1) When a project proposal includes foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, other than designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, that are not listed by the Federal Government in this Buy American notice in the request for applications or proposals, the applicant may submit an alternate proposal based on use of equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.

(2) If an alternate proposal is submitted, the applicant shall submit a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs 2 CFR 176.160(c) and (d) for the proposal that is based on the use of any foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods for which the Federal Government has not yet determined an exception applies.

(3) If the Federal Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with 2 CFR 176.160(b) does not apply, the Federal Government will evaluate only those proposals based on use of the equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, and the applicant shall be required to furnish such domestic or designated country items.

##### Subpart C - Wage Rate Requirements Under Section 1606 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

###### § 176.180 Procedure.

The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.

###### § 176.190 Award term - Wage rate requirements under Section 1606 of the Recovery Act.

When issuing announcements or requesting applications for Recovery Act programs or activities that may involve construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair the agency shall use the award term described in the following paragraphs:

(a) Section 1606 of the Recovery Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal Government pursuant to the Recovery Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.

Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14 and the Copeland Act, 40 U.S.C. 3145, the Department of Labor has issued regulations at 29 CFR parts 1, 3, and 5 to implement the Davis-Bacon and related Acts. Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).

(b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.

##### Subpart D - Single Audit Information for Recipients of Recovery Act Funds

###### § 176.200 Procedure.

The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.

###### § 176.210 Award term - Recovery Act transactions listed in Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and Recipient Responsibilities for Informing Subrecipients.

The award term described in this section shall be used by agencies to clarify recipient responsibilities regarding tracking and documenting Recovery Act expenditures:

####### http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/a102.html.

(a) To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements" and OMB Circular A-102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A-102 is available at

####### http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html.

(b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations," recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) required by OMB Circular A-133. OMB Circular A-133 is available atThis shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF-SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix "ARRA-" in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF-SAC.

(c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing program.

(d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

##### § 176.10 Purpose of this part.

This part establishes Federal Governmentwide award terms for financial assistance awards, namely, grants, cooperative agreements, and loans, to implement the cross-cutting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 111-5 (Recovery Act). These requirements are cross-cutting in that they apply to more than one agency's awards.

##### § 176.20 Agency responsibilities (general).

(a) In any assistance award funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act, the award official shall indicate that the award is being made under the Recovery Act, and indicate what projects and/or activities are being funded under the Recovery Act. This requirement applies whenever Recovery Act funds are used, regardless of the assistance type.

(b) To maximize transparency of Recovery Act funds required for reporting by the assistance recipient, the award official shall consider structuring assistance awards to allow for separately tracking Recovery Act funds.

###### http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/a102.html.

(c) Award officials shall ensure that recipients comply with the Recovery Act requirements of Subpart A. If the recipient fails to comply with the reporting requirements or other award terms, the award official or other authorized agency action official shall take the appropriate enforcement or termination action in accordance with 2 CFR 215.62 or the agency's implementation of the OMB Circular A-102 grants management common rule. OMB Circular A-102 is available at

(d) The award official shall make the recipient's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the recipient's performance record.

#### PARTS 177-179 [RESERVED]

#### PART 180 - OMB GUIDELINES TO AGENCIES ON GOVERNMENTWIDE DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT)

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 180.100 How are subparts A through I organized?

(a) Each subpart contains information related to a broad topic or specific audience with special responsibilities, as shown in the following table:

(b) The following table shows which subparts may be of special interest to you, depending on who you are:

###### § 180.105 How is this part written?

(a) This part uses a "plain language" format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use. The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.

(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as "I" and "you," change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

(c) The "Covered Transactions" diagram in the appendix to this part shows the levels or "tiers" at which a Federal agency may enforce an exclusion.

###### § 180.110 Do terms in this part have special meanings?

This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. Those terms are defined in subpart I of this part. For example, three important terms are-

####### Exclusion or excluded,

(a)which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);

####### Disqualification or disqualified,

(b)which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of a Federal agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and

####### Ineligibility or ineligible,

(c)which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.

###### § 180.115 What do Subparts A through I of this part do?

Subparts A through I of this part provide for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provide for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order or other legal authority.

###### § 180.120 Do subparts A through I of this part apply to me?

Portions of subparts A through I of this part (see table at § 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a-

(a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;

(b) Respondent (a person against whom a Federal agency has initiated a debarment or suspension action);

(c) Federal agency debarring or suspending official; or

(d) Federal agency official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

###### § 180.125 What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

(a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.

(b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.

(c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

###### § 180.130 How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

With the exceptions stated in §§ 180.135, 315, and 420, a person who is excluded by any Federal agency may not:

(a) Be a participant in a Federal agency transaction that is a covered transaction; or

(b) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.

###### § 180.135 May a Federal agency grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

(a) A Federal agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the agency head or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

(b) An exception granted by one Federal agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another Federal agency.

###### § 180.140 Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

If any Federal agency excludes a person under Executive Order 12549 or Executive Order 12689, on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible for Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.

###### § 180.145 Does an exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal agencies' nonprocurement covered transactions. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.

###### § 180.150 Against whom may a Federal agency take an exclusion action?

Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, a Federal agency may exclude any person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be a participant or principal in a covered transaction.

###### § 180.155 How do I know if a person is excluded?

Check the Governmentwide System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions) to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the SAM Exclusions and makes it available, as detailed in Subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the SAM Exclusions.

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 180.200 What is a covered transaction?

A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at-

(a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

(b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

###### § 180.205 Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

The importance of whether a transaction is a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

(a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

(b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

(c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless-

(1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 180.310 or § 180.415; or

(2) A Federal agency official obtains an exception from the agency head or designee to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 180.135.

###### § 180.210 Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 180.970, are covered transactions unless listed in the exemptions under § 180.215.

###### § 180.215 Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

(a) A direct award to-

(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

(2) A public international organization;

(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

####### et seq.,

(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

(c) Federal employment.

(d) A transaction that a Federal agency needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

(e) A permit, license, certificate or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety or the environment, unless a Federal agency specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

(g) Any other transaction if-

(1) The application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law; or

(2) A Federal agency's regulation exempts it from coverage under this part.

(h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, covered transactions must include non-procurement and procurement transactions involving entities engaged in activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in a country's non-compliance with its obligations under arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements or commitments with the United States. Federal awarding agencies and primary tier non-procurement recipients must not award, renew, or extend a non-procurement transaction or procurement transaction, regardless of amount or tier, with any entity listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions List on the basis of involvement in activities that violate arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements or commitments with the United States, pursuant to section 1290 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, unless the head of a Federal agency grants an exception pursuant to 2 CFR 180.135 with the concurrence of the OMB Director.

###### § 180.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part-

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.

(c) A subcontract also is a covered transaction if,-

(1) It is awarded by a participant in a procurement transaction under a nonprocurement transaction of a Federal agency that extends the coverage of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to additional tiers of contracts (see the diagram in the appendix to this part showing that optional lower tier coverage); and

(2) The value of the subcontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

###### § 180.225 How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the Federal agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate Federal agency official or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions Doing Business With Other Persons

###### Disclosing Information - Primary Tier Participants

####### § 180.335 What information must I provide before entering into a covered transaction with a Federal agency?

Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you as the participant must notify the Federal agency office that is entering into the transaction with you, if you know that you or any of the principals for that covered transaction:

(a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;

(b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed in § 180.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;

(c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in § 180.800(a); or

(d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.

###### § 180.700 When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that-

(a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 180.800(a), or

(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 180.800(b) through (d); and

(c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

###### § 180.705 What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

(b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

(4) All of your affiliates.

(b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the Federal agency taking the action may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.

###### § 180.755 When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.

###### § 180.760 How long may my suspension last?

(a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

(b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

After consideration of the causes in § 180.800, if the debarring official proposes to debar you, the official sends you a Notice of Proposed Debarment, pursuant to § 180.615, advising you-

(a) That the debarring official is considering debarring you;

(b) Of the reasons for proposing to debar you in terms sufficient to put you on notice of the conduct or transactions upon which the proposed debarment is based;

(c) Of the cause(s) under § 180.800 upon which the debarring official relied for proposing your debarment;

(d) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, subpart F of this part, and any other agency procedures governing debarment; and

(e) Of the governmentwide effect of a debarment from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.

###### § 180.810 When does a debarment take effect?

Unlike suspension, a debarment is not effective until the debarring official issues a decision. The debarring official does not issue a decision until the respondent has had an opportunity to contest the proposed debarment.

###### § 180.815 How may I contest a proposed debarment?

If you as a respondent wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or your representative must provide the debarring official with information in opposition to the proposed debarment. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.

###### § 180.820 How much time do I have to contest a proposed debarment?

(a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or make arrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to the debarring official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of Proposed Debarment.

(b) The Federal agency taking the action considers the Notice of Proposed Debarment to be received by you-

(1) When delivered, if the agency mails the notice to the last known street address, or five days after the agency sends it if the letter is undeliverable;

(2) When sent, if the agency sends the notice by facsimile or five days after the agency sends it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or

(3) When delivered, if the agency sends the notice by e-mail or five days after the agency sends it if the e-mail is undeliverable.

###### § 180.825 What information must I provide to the debarring official if I contest the proposed debarment?

(a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the debarring official must identify-

(1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment. Include any information about any of the factors listed in § 180.860. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the debarment;

(2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing Executive Order 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, State, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Proposed Debarment that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

(4) All of your affiliates.

(b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the Federal agency taking the action may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.

###### § 180.830 Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the proposed debarment is based?

(a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that-

(1) Your debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment;

(2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment; or

(3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the proposed debarment are not factual in nature, or are not material to the debarring official's decision whether to debar.

(b) You will have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that-

(1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

(2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment.

(c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the debarring official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

###### § 180.835 Are debarment proceedings formal?

(a) Debarment proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The debarring official may use flexible procedures to allow you as a respondent to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the debarring official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base the decision whether to debar.

(b) You or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the debarring official to consider.

###### § 180.840 How is fact-finding conducted?

(a) If fact-finding is conducted-

(1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any witness presented; and

(2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the record.

(b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, unless you as a respondent and the Federal agency agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase it.

###### § 180.845 What does the debarring official consider in deciding whether to debar me?

(a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in § 180.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at § 180.860.

(b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes-

(1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed debarment;

(2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or in opposition to, the proposed debarment; and

(3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

(c) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any resultant findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

###### § 180.850 What is the standard of proof in a debarment action?

(a) In any debarment action, the Federal agency must establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence.

(b) If the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard of proof is met.

###### § 180.855 Who has the burden of proof in a debarment action?

(a) The Federal agency has the burden to prove that a cause for debarment exists.

(b) Once a cause for debarment is established, you as a respondent have the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the debarring official that you are presently responsible and that debarment is not necessary.

###### § 180.860 What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.

(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.

(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.

(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.

(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.

(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.

(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.

(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.

(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.

(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.

(s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.

###### § 180.865 How long may my debarment last?

(a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.

(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 180.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.

(c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.

###### § 180.870 When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

(a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.

(b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 180.615 that the official decided, either-

(1) Not to debar you; or

(2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:

(i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;

(ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;

(iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and

(iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee grants an exception.

###### § 180.875 May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?

Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and support it with documentation.

###### § 180.880 What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on-

(a) Newly discovered material evidence;

(b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;

(c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

(d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

(e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.

###### § 180.885 May the debarring official extend a debarment?

(a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.

(b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.

(c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to extend the debarment.

This part provides Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance for Federal agencies on the governmentwide debarment and suspension system for nonprocurement programs and activities.

##### § 180.10 How is this part organized?

This part is organized in two segments.

(a) Sections 180.5 through 180.45 contain general policy direction for Federal agencies' use of the standards in subparts A through I of this part.

(b) Subparts A through I of this part contain uniform governmentwide standards that Federal agencies are to use to specify-

(1) The types of transactions that are covered by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system;

(2) The effects of an exclusion under that nonprocurement system, including reciprocal effects with the governmentwide debarment and suspension system for procurement;

(3) The criteria and minimum due process to be used in nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions; and

(4) Related policies and procedures to ensure the effectiveness of those actions.

##### § 180.15 To whom does the guidance apply?

The guidance provides OMB guidance only to Federal agencies. Publication of the guidance in the CFR does not change its nature-it is guidance and not regulation. Federal agencies' implementation of the guidance governs the rights and responsibilities of other persons affected by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system.

##### § 180.20 What must a Federal agency do to implement these guidelines?

As required by Section 3 of E.O. 12549, each Federal agency with nonprocurement programs and activities covered by subparts A through I of the guidance must issue regulations consistent with those subparts.

##### § 180.25 What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?

Each Federal agency implementing regulation:

(a) Must establish policies and procedures for that agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension programs and activities that are consistent with the guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have regulatory effect for that agency's programs and activities.

(b) Must address some matters for which these guidelines give each Federal agency some discretion. Specifically, the regulation must-

(1) Identify either the Federal agency head or the title of the designated official who is authorized to grant exceptions under § 180.135 to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction.

(2) State whether the agency includes as covered transactions an additional tier of contracts awarded under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under § 180.220(c).

(3) Identify the method(s) an agency official may use, when entering into a covered transaction with a primary tier participant, to communicate to the participant the requirements described in § 180.435. Examples of methods are an award term that requires compliance as a condition of the award; an assurance of compliance obtained at time of application; or a certification.

(4) State whether the Federal agency specifies a particular method that participants must use to communicate compliance requirements to lower-tier participants, as described in § 180.330(a). If there is a specified method, the regulation needs to require agency officials, when entering into covered transactions with primary tier participants, to communicate that requirement.

(c) May also, at the agency's option:

(1) Identify any specific types of transactions that the Federal agency includes as "nonprocurement transactions" in addition to the examples provided in § 180.970.

(2) Identify any types of nonprocurement transactions that the Federal agency exempts from coverage under these guidelines, as authorized under § 180.215(g)(2).

(3) Identify specific examples of types of individuals who would be "principals" under the Federal agency's nonprocurement programs and transactions, in addition to the types of individuals described at § 180.995.

(4) Specify the Federal agency's procedures, if any, by which a respondent may appeal a suspension or debarment decision.

(5) Identify by title the officials designated by the Federal agency head as debarring officials under § 180.930 or suspending officials under § 180.1010.

(6) Include a subpart covering disqualifications, as authorized in § 180.45.

(7) Include any provisions authorized by OMB.

##### § 180.30 Where does a Federal agency implement these guidelines?

Each Federal agency that participates in the governmentwide nonprocurement debarment and suspension system must issue a regulation implementing these guidelines within its chapter in subtitle B of this title of the Code of Federal Regulations.

##### § 180.35 By when must a Federal agency implement these guidelines?

Federal agencies must submit proposed regulations to the OMB for review within nine months of the issuance of these guidelines and issue final regulations within eighteen months of these guidelines.

##### § 180.40 How are these guidelines maintained?

The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension established by section 4 of E.O. 12549 recommends to the OMB any needed revisions to the guidelines in this part. The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidelines in thefor public comment, considers comments with the help of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, and issues the final guidelines.

##### § 180.45 Do these guidelines cover persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

A Federal agency may add a subpart covering disqualifications to its regulation implementing these guidelines, but the guidelines in subparts A through I of this part-

(a) Address disqualified persons only to-

(1) Provide for their inclusion in SAM Exclusions; and

(2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

(b) Do not specify the-

(1) Transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order or regulation that caused the disqualification;

(2) Entities to which a disqualification applies; or

(3) Process that a Federal agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion under subparts A through I of this part, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes, and may include special procedures.

##### Appendix to Part 180 - Covered Transactions

#### PART 181 [RESERVED]

#### PART 182 - GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

##### Subpart A - Purpose and Coverage

###### § 182.100 How is this part written?

(a) This part uses a "plain language" format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use and understand. The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.

(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as "I" and "you," change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.

###### § 182.105 Do terms in this part have special meanings?

This part uses terms that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart F of this part.

###### § 182.110 What do subparts A through F of this part do?

Subparts A through F of this part specify standard policies and procedures to carry out the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for financial assistance awards.

###### § 182.115 Does this part apply to me?

(a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either-

(1) A recipient of a Federal assistance award (see definitions of award and recipient in §§ 182.605 and 182.660, respectively); or

###### § 182.125 Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

This part will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 182.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

(c) The Federal awarding agency shall document and report to the head of the executive agency concerned (or the designee of such head) and the commander of the covered combatant command concerned (or specific deputies):

(1) Any action to restrict all future awards or to terminate or void an award with a covered person or entity.

(2) Any decision not to restrict all future awards, terminate, or void an award along with the agency's reasoning for not taking one of these actions after the agency became aware that a person or entity is a prohibited or restricted source.

(1) The executive agency taking such action.

(2) An explanation of the basis for the action taken.

##### Subpart B - General Provisions

###### § 200.100 Purpose.

####### Purpose.

(a)(1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards to non-Federal entities, as described in § 200.101. Federal awarding agencies must not impose additional or inconsistent requirements, except as provided in §§ 200.102 and 200.211, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive order.

(2) This part provides the basis for a systematic and periodic collection and uniform submission by Federal agencies of information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It prescribes the manner in which General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies that administer Federal financial assistance programs are to carry out their statutory responsibilities under the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106).

####### Administrative requirements.

(b)Subparts B through D of this part set forth the uniform administrative requirements for grant and cooperative agreements, including the requirements for Federal awarding agency management of Federal grant programs before the Federal award has been made, and the requirements Federal awarding agencies may impose on non-Federal entities in the Federal award.

####### Cost principles.

(c)Subpart E of this part establishes principles for determining the allowable costs incurred by non-Federal entities under Federal awards. The principles are for the purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal Government participation in the financing of a particular program or project. The principles are designed to provide that Federal awards bear their fair share of cost recognized under these principles except where restricted or prohibited by statute.

####### Single Audit Requirements and Audit Follow-up.

(d)Subpart F of this part is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. These provisions also provide the policies and procedures for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.

####### Guidance on challenges and prizes.

(e)For OMB guidance to Federal awarding agencies on challenges and prizes, please see memo M-10-11 Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government, issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.

###### § 200.101 Applicability.

####### General applicability to Federal agencies.

(a)(1) The requirements established in this part apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. These requirements are applicable to all costs related to Federal awards.

(2) Federal awarding agencies may apply subparts A through E of this part to Federal agencies, for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations, except where the Federal awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international responsibilities of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government.

####### Applicability to different types of Federal awards.

(b)(1) Throughout this part when the word "must" is used it indicates a requirement. Whereas, use of the word "should" or "may" indicates a best practice or recommended approach rather than a requirement and permits discretion.

(2) The following table describes what portions of this part apply to which types of Federal awards. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. This means that non-Federal entities must comply with requirements in this part regardless of whether the non-Federal entity is a recipient or subrecipient of a Federal award. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in subpart D of this part, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, but not any requirements in this part directed towards Federal awarding agencies unless the requirements of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award indicate otherwise.

####### Federal award of cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR to a non-Federal entity.

(c)When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract, but the requirements of subparts D, E, and F are supplementary to the FAR and the contract. When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part, including subpart F of this part, which are supplementary to the CAS requirements. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR 48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603 are always unallowable. For requirements other than those covered in subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F of this part, the terms of the contract and the FAR apply. Note that when a non-Federal entity is awarded a FAR contract, the FAR applies, and the terms and conditions of the contract shall prevail over the requirements of this part.

####### Governing provisions.

(d)With the exception of subpart F of this part, which is required by the Single Audit Act, in any circumstances where the provisions of Federal statutes or regulations differ from the provisions of this part, the provision of the Federal statutes or regulations govern. This includes, for agreements with Indian tribes, the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended, 25 U.S.C 450-458ddd-2.

####### Program applicability.

(e)Except for §§ 200.203, 200.216, and 200.331 through 200.333, the requirements in subparts C, D, and E of this part do not apply to the following programs:

As required by Public Law 112-239, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, prior to making a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency must consider all of the information available through FAPIIS with regard to the applicant and any immediate highest level owner, predecessor (a non-Federal entity that is replaced by a successor), or subsidiary, identified for that applicant in FAPIIS, if applicable. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. The Federal awarding agency may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with § 200.208.

####### Risk evaluation.

(b)(1) The Federal awarding agency must have in place a framework for evaluating the risks posed by applicants before they receive Federal awards. This evaluation may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If the Federal awarding agency determines that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. Criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of funding opportunity described in § 200.204.

(2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal awarding agency may use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following:

####### Financial stability.

(i)Financial stability;

####### Management systems and standards.

(ii)Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;

####### History of performance.

(iii)The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards;

####### Audit reports and findings.

(iv)Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F of this part or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and

####### Ability to effectively implement requirements.

(v)The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities.

####### Risk-based requirements adjustment.

(c)The Federal awarding agency may adjust requirements when a risk-evaluation indicates that it may be merited either pre-award or post-award.

####### Suspension and debarment compliance.

(d)(1) The Federal awarding agency must comply with the guidelines on governmentwide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and must require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities.

###### § 200.207 Standard application requirements.

####### Paperwork clearances.

(a)The Federal awarding agency may only use application information collections approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 and in alignment with OMB-approved, governmentwide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead. Consistent with these requirements, OMB will authorize additional information collections only on a limited basis.

###### § 200.208 Specific conditions.

(a) Federal awarding agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award conditions are consistent with the program design reflected in § 200.202 and include clear performance expectations of recipients as required in § 200.301.

(b) The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific Federal award conditions as needed, in accordance with this section, based on an analysis of the following factors:

(1) Based on the criteria set forth in § 200.206;

(2) The applicant or recipient's history of compliance with the general or specific terms and conditions of a Federal award;

(3) The applicant or recipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as described in § 200.211; or

(4) A responsibility determination of an applicant or recipient.

(c) Additional Federal award conditions may include items such as the following:

(1) Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments;

(2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance within a given performance period;

(3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;

(4) Requiring additional project monitoring;

(5) Requiring the non-Federal entity to obtain technical or management assistance; or

(6) Establishing additional prior approvals.

(d) If the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity is imposing additional requirements, they must notify the applicant or non-Federal entity as to:

(1) The nature of the additional requirements;

(2) The reason why the additional requirements are being imposed;

(3) The nature of the action needed to remove the additional requirement, if applicable;

(4) The time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and

(5) The method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed.

(e) Any additional requirements must be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been satisfied.

####### Recipient integrity and performance matters.

(iii)If the total Federal share of the Federal award may include more than $500,000 over the period of performance, the Federal awarding agency must include the term and condition available in appendix XII of this part. See also § 200.113.

####### Future budget periods.

(iv)If it is anticipated that the period of performance will include multiple budget periods, the Federal awarding agency must indicate that subsequent budget periods are subject to the availability of funds, program authority, satisfactory performance, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

####### Termination provisions.

(v)Federal awarding agencies must make recipients aware, in a clear and unambiguous manner, of the termination provisions in § 200.340, including the applicable termination provisions in the Federal awarding agency's regulations or in each Federal award.

(2) The Federal award must incorporate, by reference, all general terms and conditions of the award, which must be maintained on the agency's website.

(3) If a non-Federal entity requests a copy of the full text of the general terms and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must provide it.

(4) Wherever the general terms and conditions are publicly available, the Federal awarding agency must maintain an archive of previous versions of the general terms and conditions, with effective dates, for use by the non-Federal entity, auditors, or others.

####### Federal awarding agency, program, or Federal award specific terms and conditions.

(d)The Federal awarding agency must include with each Federal award any terms and conditions necessary to communicate requirements that are in addition to the requirements outlined in the Federal awarding agency's general terms and conditions.

(b) All information posted in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) on or after April 15, 2011 will be publicly available after a waiting period of 14 calendar days, except for:

(1) Past performance reviews required by Federal Government contractors in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR part 42, subpart 42.15;

(2) Information that was entered prior to April 15, 2011; or

(3) Information that is withdrawn during the 14-calendar day waiting period by the Federal Government official.

(c) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring the publication of information otherwise exempt under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552), or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556.

###### § 200.213 Reporting a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award.

(a) If a Federal awarding agency does not make a Federal award to a non-Federal entity because the official determines that the non-Federal entity does not meet either or both of the minimum qualification standards as described in § 200.206(a)(2), the Federal awarding agency must report that determination to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS), only if all of the following apply:

####### i.e.,

(1) The only basis for the determination described in this paragraph (a) is the non-Federal entity's prior record of executing programs or activities under Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in § 200.206(a)(2) (the entity was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards); and

(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award that otherwise would be made to the non-Federal entity is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.

(b) The Federal awarding agency is not required to report a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award if they make the Federal award to the non-Federal entity and include specific award terms and conditions, as described in § 200.208.

(c) If a Federal awarding agency reports a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal awarding agency also must notify the non-Federal entity that-

(1) The determination was made and reported to the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM, and include with the notification an explanation of the basis for the determination;

(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination, as required by section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313), then archived;

(3) Each Federal awarding agency that considers making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award when the total Federal share of the Federal award is expected to include an amount of Federal funding in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;

(4) The non-Federal entity may go to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)) and comment on any information the system contains about the non-Federal entity itself; and

(5) Federal awarding agencies will consider that non-Federal entity's comments in determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.

(d) If a Federal awarding agency enters information into the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM about a determination that a non-Federal entity is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently:

(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in the system within three business days; and

(2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the Federal awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.

(e) Federal awarding agencies must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency that posted the information that some or all of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal awarding agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal awarding agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.

###### § 200.214 Suspension and debarment.

Non-Federal entities are subject to the non-procurement debarment and suspension regulations implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, 2 CFR part 180. The regulations in 2 CFR part 180 restrict awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

###### § 200.215 Never contract with the enemy.

Federal awarding agencies and recipients are subject to the regulations implementing Never Contract with the Enemy in 2 CFR part 183. The regulations in 2 CFR part 183 affect covered contracts, grants and cooperative agreements that are expected to exceed $50,000 within the period of performance, are performed outside the United States and its territories, and are in support of a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities.

###### § 200.216 Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment.

(a) Recipients and subrecipients are prohibited from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to:

(1) Procure or obtain;

(2) Extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain; or

(3) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain equipment, services, or systems that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system. As described in Public Law 115-232, section 889, covered telecommunications equipment is telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).

(i) For the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities).

(ii) Telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entities or using such equipment.

(iii) Telecommunications or video surveillance equipment or services produced or provided by an entity that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of the National Intelligence or the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reasonably believes to be an entity owned or controlled by, or otherwise connected to, the government of a covered foreign country.

(b) In implementing the prohibition under Public Law 115-232, section 889, subsection (f), paragraph (1), heads of executive agencies administering loan, grant, or subsidy programs shall prioritize available funding and technical support to assist affected businesses, institutions and organizations as is reasonably necessary for those affected entities to transition from covered communications equipment and services, to procure replacement equipment and services, and to ensure that communications service to users and customers is sustained.

(c) See Public Law 115-232, section 889 for additional information.

(d) See also § 200.471.

##### Subpart D - Post Federal Award Requirements

###### Property Standards

####### § 200.310 Insurance coverage.

The non-Federal entity must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the non-Federal entity. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

####### § 200.311 Real property.

######## Title.

(a)Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or improved under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity.

######## Use.

(b)Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or by the Federal awarding agency, real property will be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the non-Federal entity must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.

######## Disposition.

(c)When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the non-Federal entity must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. The instructions must provide for one of the following alternatives:

(1) Retain title after compensating the Federal awarding agency. The amount paid to the Federal awarding agency will be computed by applying the Federal awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where the non-Federal entity is disposing of real property acquired or improved with a Federal award and acquiring replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.

(2) Sell the property and compensate the Federal awarding agency. The amount due to the Federal awarding agency will be calculated by applying the Federal awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When the non-Federal entity is directed to sell property, sales procedures must be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(3) Transfer title to the Federal awarding agency or to a third party designated/approved by the Federal awarding agency. The non-Federal entity is entitled to be paid an amount calculated by applying the non-Federal entity's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) to the current fair market value of the property.

####### § 200.312 Federally-owned and exempt property.

(a) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. The non-Federal entity must submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in its custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the Federal award or when the property is no longer needed, the non-Federal entity must report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.

######## e.g.,

(b) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (i)) to donate research equipment to educational and nonprofit organizations in accordance with Executive Order 12999, "Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century."). The Federal awarding agency must issue appropriate instructions to the non-Federal entity.

(c) Exempt property means property acquired under a Federal award where the Federal awarding agency has chosen to vest title to the property to the non-Federal entity without further responsibility to the Federal Government, based upon the explicit terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal awarding agency may exercise this option when statutory authority exists. Absent statutory authority and specific terms and conditions of the Federal award, title to exempt property acquired under the Federal award remains with the Federal Government.

####### § 200.313 Equipment.

See also § 200.439.

######## Title.

(a)Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity. Unless a statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the non-Federal entity without further responsibility to the Federal Government, and the Federal agency elects to do so, the title must be a conditional title. Title must vest in the non-Federal entity subject to the following conditions:

(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.

(2) Not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section.

######## General.

(b)A state must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures. Other non-Federal entities must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

######## Use.

(c)(1) Equipment must be used by the non-Federal entity in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award, and the non-Federal entity must not encumber the property without prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency may require the submission of the applicable common form for equipment. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities supported by the Federal awarding agency, in the following order of priority:

(i) Activities under a Federal award from the Federal awarding agency which funded the original program or project, then

(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other Federal awarding agencies. This includes consolidated equipment for information technology systems.

(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the non-Federal entity must also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use must be given to other programs or projects supported by Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment and second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal awarding agencies. Use for non-federally-funded programs or projects is also permissible. User fees should be considered if appropriate.

(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 200.307 to earn program income, the non-Federal entity must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the non-Federal entity may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property.

######## Management requirements.

(d)Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part under a Federal award, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:

(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the project costs for the Federal award under which the property was acquired, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.

(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft must be investigated.

(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.

(5) If the non-Federal entity is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.

######## Disposition.

(e)When original or replacement equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal awarding agency, except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or Federal awarding agency disposition instructions, the non-Federal entity must request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with Federal awarding agency disposition instructions:

(1) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or less may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the Federal awarding agency.

(2) Except as provided in § 200.312(b), or if the Federal awarding agency fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained by the non-Federal entity or sold. The Federal awarding agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the Federal awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase. If the equipment is sold, the Federal awarding agency may permit the non-Federal entity to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses.

(3) The non-Federal entity may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the non-Federal entity must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

(4) In cases where a non-Federal entity fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the Federal awarding agency may direct the non-Federal entity to take disposition actions.

####### § 200.314 Supplies.

See also § 200.453.

(a) Title to supplies will vest in the non-Federal entity upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the non-Federal entity must retain the supplies for use on other activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation must be computed in the same manner as for equipment. See § 200.313 (e)(2) for the calculation methodology.

(b) As long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies, the non-Federal entity must not use supplies acquired under a Federal award to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute.

####### § 200.315 Intangible property.

######## Intangible property

(a) Title to intangible property (see definition forin § 200.1) acquired under a Federal award vests upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity. The non-Federal entity must use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and must not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property must occur in accordance with the provisions in § 200.313(e).

(b) The non-Federal entity may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

(c) The non-Federal entity is subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Awards, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements."

(d) The Federal Government has the right to:

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under a Federal award; and

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

(e)(1) In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings produced under a Federal award that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the Federal awarding agency must request, and the non-Federal entity must provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA. If the Federal awarding agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the Federal awarding agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This fee is in addition to any fees the Federal awarding agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).

(2) Published research findings means when:

(i) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or

(ii) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law. "Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law" is defined as when an agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.

######## e.g.,

(3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This "recorded" material excludes physical objects (laboratory samples). Research data also do not include:

(i) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and

(ii) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.

####### § 200.316 Property trust relationship.

Real property, equipment, and intangible property, that are acquired or improved with a Federal award must be held in trust by the non-Federal entity as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. The Federal awarding agency may require the non-Federal entity to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with a Federal award and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

###### Procurement Standards

####### § 200.317 Procurements by states.

When procuring property and services under a Federal award, a State must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will comply with §§ 200.321, 200.322, and 200.323 and ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by § 200.327. All other non-Federal entities, including subrecipients of a State, must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.318 through 200.327.

####### § 200.318 General procurement standards.

(a) The non-Federal entity must have and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with State, local, and tribal laws and regulations and the standards of this section, for the acquisition of property or services required under a Federal award or subaward. The non-Federal entity's documented procurement procedures must conform to the procurement standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.

(b) Non-Federal entities must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

(c)(1) The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. The officers, employees, and agents of the non-Federal entity may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. However, non-Federal entities may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the non-Federal entity.

(2) If the non-Federal entity has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the non-Federal entity is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.

(d) The non-Federal entity's procedures must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.

(e) To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the Federal Government, the non-Federal entity is encouraged to enter into state and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services. Competition requirements will be met with documented procurement actions using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements.

(f) The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.

(g) The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.

(h) The non-Federal entity must award contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. See also § 200.214.

(i) The non-Federal entity must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

(j)(1) The non-Federal entity may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a non-Federal entity is the sum of:

(i) The actual cost of materials; and

(ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.

(2) Since this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the non-Federal entity awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.

(k) The non-Federal entity alone must be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the non-Federal entity of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Federal awarding agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the non-Federal entity unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, state, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.

####### § 200.319 Competition.

(a) All procurement transactions for the acquisition of property or services required under a Federal award must be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of this section and § 200.320.

(b) In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:

(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;

(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;

(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;

(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;

(5) Organizational conflicts of interest;

(6) Specifying only a "brand name" product instead of allowing "an equal" product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and

(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.

(c) The non-Federal entity must conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.

(d) The non-Federal entity must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:

(1) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a "brand name or equivalent" description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers must be clearly stated; and

(2) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

(e) The non-Federal entity must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, the non-Federal entity must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.

(f) Noncompetitive procurements can only be awarded in accordance with § 200.320(c).

####### § 200.320 Methods of procurement to be followed.

The non-Federal entity must have and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with the standards of this section and §§ 200.317, 200.318, and 200.319 for any of the following methods of procurement used for the acquisition of property or services required under a Federal award or sub-award.

######## Informal procurement methods.,simplified acquisition threshold (SAT),

(a)When the value of the procurement for property or services under a Federal award does not exceed theas defined in § 200.1, or a lower threshold established by a non-Federal entity, formal procurement methods are not required. The non-Federal entity may use informal procurement methods to expedite the completion of its transactions and minimize the associated administrative burden and cost. The informal methods used for procurement of property or services at or below the SAT include:

######## Micro-purchases,Distribution.,micro-purchase

(1)-(i)The acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (See the definition ofin § 200.1). To the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal entity should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.

######## Micro-purchase awards.

(ii)Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the non-Federal entity considers the price to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other information and documents it files accordingly. Purchase cards can be used for micro-purchases if procedures are documented and approved by the non-Federal entity.

######## Micro-purchase thresholds.

(iii)The non-Federal entity is responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold used by the non-Federal entity must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations. Non-Federal entities may establish a threshold higher than the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section.

######## Non-Federal entity increase to the micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000.

(iv)Non-Federal entities may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The non-Federal entity may self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to be made available to the Federal awarding agency and auditors in accordance with § 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following:

(A) A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in § 200.520 for the most recent audit;

(B) An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or,

(C) For public institutions, a higher threshold consistent with State law.

######## Non-Federal entity increase to the micro-purchase threshold over $50,000.

(v)Micro-purchase thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The non-federal entity must submit a request with the requirements included in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. The increased threshold is valid until there is a change in status in which the justification was approved.

######## Small purchases,Small purchase procedures.

(2)-(i)The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources as determined appropriate by the non-Federal entity.

######## Simplified acquisition thresholds.

(ii)The non-Federal entity is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk and its documented procurement procedures which must not exceed the threshold established in the FAR. When applicable, a lower simplified acquisition threshold used by the non-Federal entity must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations.

######## Formal procurement methods.

(b)When the value of the procurement for property or services under a Federal financial assistance award exceeds the SAT, or a lower threshold established by a non-Federal entity, formal procurement methods are required. Formal procurement methods require following documented procedures. Formal procurement methods also require public advertising unless a non-competitive procurement can be used in accordance with § 200.319 or paragraph (c) of this section. The following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement of property or services above the simplified acquisition threshold or a value below the simplified acquisition threshold the non-Federal entity determines to be appropriate:

######## Sealed bids.

(1)A procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bids method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions.

(i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:

(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;

(B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and

(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.

(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:

(A) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids, for local, and tribal governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised;

(B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;

(C) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids, and for local and tribal governments, the bids must be opened publicly;

(D) A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and

(E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.

######## Proposals.

(2)A procurement method in which either a fixed price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. Proposals are generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements:

(i) Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified offerors. Any response to publicized requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical;

(ii) The non-Federal entity must have a written method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and making selections;

(iii) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the non-Federal entity, with price and other factors considered; and

(iv) The non-Federal entity may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby offeror's qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms that are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.

######## Noncompetitive procurement.

(c)There are specific circumstances in which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:

(1) The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);

(2) The item is available only from a single source;

(3) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;

(4) The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the non-Federal entity; or

(5) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

####### § 200.321 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms.

(a) The non-Federal entity must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.

(b) Affirmative steps must include:

(1) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;

(2) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;

(3) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises;

(4) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises;

(5) Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

(6) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.

####### § 200.322 Domestic preferences for procurements.

(a) As appropriate and to the extent consistent with law, the non-Federal entity should, to the greatest extent practicable under a Federal award, provide a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States (including but not limited to iron, aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The requirements of this section must be included in all subawards including all contracts and purchase orders for work or products under this award.

(b) For purposes of this section:

(1) "Produced in the United States" means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States.

(2) "Manufactured products" means items and construction materials composed in whole or in part of non-ferrous metals such as aluminum; plastics and polymer-based products such as polyvinyl chloride pipe; aggregates such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber.

####### § 200.323 Procurement of recovered materials.

A non-Federal entity that is a state agency or agency of a political subdivision of a state and its contractors must comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The requirements of Section 6002 include procuring only items designated in guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines.

####### § 200.324 Contract cost and price.

(a) The non-Federal entity must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, the non-Federal entity must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.

(b) The non-Federal entity must negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

(c) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the non-Federal entity under subpart E of this part. The non-Federal entity may reference its own cost principles that comply with the Federal cost principles.

(d) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting must not be used.

####### § 200.325 Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity review.

(a) The non-Federal entity must make available, upon request of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity believes such review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the non-Federal entity desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

(b) The non-Federal entity must make available upon request, for the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity pre-procurement review, procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates, when:

(1) The non-Federal entity's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;

(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation;

(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, specifies a "brand name" product;

(4) The proposed contract is more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or

(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

(c) The non-Federal entity is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.

(1) The non-Federal entity may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis;

(2) The non-Federal entity may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification must not limit the Federal awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the Federal awarding agency may rely on written assurances from the non-Federal entity that it is complying with these standards. The non-Federal entity must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.

####### § 200.326 Bonding requirements.

For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the non-Federal entity provided that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity has made a determination that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:

(a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The "bid guarantee" must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

(b) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A "performance bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's requirements under such contract.

(c) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A "payment bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

####### § 200.327 Contract provisions.

The non-Federal entity's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described in appendix II to this part.

###### Performance and Financial Monitoring and Reporting

####### § 200.328 Financial reporting.

Unless otherwise approved by OMB, the Federal awarding agency must solicit only the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of financial information (at time of publication the Federal Financial Report or such future, OMB-approved, governmentwide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead. This information must be collected with the frequency required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award, but no less frequently than annually nor more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes, and preferably in coordination with performance reporting. The Federal awarding agency must use OMB-approved common information collections, as applicable, when providing financial and performance reporting information.

####### § 200.329 Monitoring and reporting program performance.

######## Monitoring by the non-Federal entity.

(a)The non-Federal entity is responsible for oversight of the operations of the Federal award supported activities. The non-Federal entity must monitor its activities under Federal awards to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and performance expectations are being achieved. Monitoring by the non-Federal entity must cover each program, function or activity. See also § 200.332.

######## Reporting program performance.,e.g.,,e.g.,

(b)The Federal awarding agency must use OMB-approved common information collections, as applicable, when providing financial and performance reporting information. As appropriate and in accordance with above mentioned information collections, the Federal awarding agency must require the recipient to relate financial data and accomplishments to performance goals and objectives of the Federal award. Also, in accordance with above mentioned common information collections, and when required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award, recipients must provide cost information to demonstrate cost effective practices (through unit cost data). In some instances (discretionary research awards), this will be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports (to be evaluated in accordance with Federal awarding agency policy). Reporting requirements must be clearly articulated such that, where appropriate, performance during the execution of the Federal award has a standard against which non-Federal entity performance can be measured.

######## Non-construction performance reports.

(c)The Federal awarding agency must use standard, governmentwide OMB-approved data elements for collection of performance information including performance progress reports, Research Performance Progress Reports.

(1) The non-Federal entity must submit performance reports at the interval required by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to best inform improvements in program outcomes and productivity. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes. Reports submitted annually by the non-Federal entity and/or pass-through entity must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year Federal awards. The final performance report submitted by the non-Federal entity and/or pass-through entity must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance end date. A subrecipient must submit to the pass-through entity, no later than 90 calendar days after the period of performance end date, all final performance reports as required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.344. If a justified request is submitted by a non-Federal entity, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report.

(2) As appropriate in accordance with above mentioned performance reporting, these reports will contain, for each Federal award, brief information on the following unless other data elements are approved by OMB in the agency information collection request:

(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the period. Where the accomplishments of the Federal award can be quantified, a computation of the cost (for example, related to units of accomplishment) may be required if that information will be useful. Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the Federal awarding agency program, the Federal awarding agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.

(ii) The reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

######## Construction performance reports.

(d)For the most part, onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data are relied on heavily by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to monitor progress under Federal awards and subawards for construction. The Federal awarding agency may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.

######## Significant developments.

(e)Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates that have significant impact upon the supported activity. In such cases, the non-Federal entity must inform the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity as soon as the following types of conditions become known:

(1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the Federal award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

(2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more or different beneficial results than originally planned.

######## Site visits.

(f)The Federal awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

######## Performance report requirement waiver.

(g)The Federal awarding agency may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.

####### § 200.330 Reporting on real property.

######## e.g.,

The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must require a non-Federal entity to submit reports at least annually on the status of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest, unless the Federal interest in the real property extends 15 years or longer. In those instances where the Federal interest attached is for a period of 15 years or more, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, at its option, may require the non-Federal entity to report at various multi-year frequencies (every two years or every three years, not to exceed a five-year reporting period; or a Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may require annual reporting for the first three years of a Federal award and thereafter require reporting every five years).

###### Subrecipient Monitoring and Management

####### § 200.331 Subrecipient and contractor determinations.

The non-Federal entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor, depending on the substance of its agreements with Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. Therefore, a pass-through entity must make case-by-case determinations whether each agreement it makes for the disbursement of Federal program funds casts the party receiving the funds in the role of a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal awarding agency may supply and require recipients to comply with additional guidance to support these determinations provided such guidance does not conflict with this section.

######## Subrecipients.,Subaward

(a)A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of a Federal award and creates a Federal assistance relationship with the subrecipient. See definition forin § 200.1 of this part. Characteristics which support the classification of the non-Federal entity as a subrecipient include when the non-Federal entity:

(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;

(2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether objectives of a Federal program were met;

(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision-making;

(4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and

(5) In accordance with its agreement, uses the Federal funds to carry out a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.

######## Contractors.,contract

(b)A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the non-Federal entity's own use and creates a procurement relationship with the contractor. See the definition ofin § 200.1 of this part. Characteristics indicative of a procurement relationship between the non-Federal entity and a contractor are when the contractor:

(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;

(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;

(3) Normally operates in a competitive environment;

(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and

(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program as a result of the agreement, though similar requirements may apply for other reasons.

######## Use of judgment in making determination.

(c)In determining whether an agreement between a pass-through entity and another non-Federal entity casts the latter as a subrecipient or a contractor, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. All of the characteristics listed above may not be present in all cases, and the pass-through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract.

####### § 200.332 Requirements for pass-through entities.

All pass-through entities must:

(a) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the following information at the time of the subaward and if any of these data elements change, include the changes in subsequent subaward modification. When some of this information is not available, the pass-through entity must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award and subaward. Required information includes:

(1) Federal award identification.

(i) Subrecipient name (which must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier);

(ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier;

(iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);

######## Federal award date

(iv) Federal Award Date (see the definition ofin § 200.1 of this part) of award to the recipient by the Federal agency;

(v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date;

(vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date;

(vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass-through entity to the subrecipient;

(viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity including the current financial obligation;

(ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity;

(x) Federal award project description, as required to be responsive to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA);

(xi) Name of Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, and contact information for awarding official of the Pass-through entity;

(xii) Assistance Listings number and Title; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at time of disbursement;

(xiii) Identification of whether the award is R&D; and

(xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged) per § 200.414.

(2) All requirements imposed by the pass-through entity on the subrecipient so that the Federal award is used in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;

(3) Any additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient in order for the pass-through entity to meet its own responsibility to the Federal awarding agency including identification of any required financial and performance reports;

(4)(i) An approved federally recognized indirect cost rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal Government. If no approved rate exists, the pass-through entity must determine the appropriate rate in collaboration with the subrecipient, which is either:

(A) The negotiated indirect cost rate between the pass-through entity and the subrecipient; which can be based on a prior negotiated rate between a different PTE and the same subrecipient. If basing the rate on a previously negotiated rate, the pass-through entity is not required to collect information justifying this rate, but may elect to do so;

(B) The de minimis indirect cost rate.

(ii) The pass-through entity must not require use of a de minimis indirect cost rate if the subrecipient has a Federally approved rate. Subrecipients can elect to use the cost allocation method to account for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.405(d).

(5) A requirement that the subrecipient permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the subrecipient's records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to meet the requirements of this part; and

(6) Appropriate terms and conditions concerning closeout of the subaward.

(b) Evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, which may include consideration of such factors as:

(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;

(2) The results of previous audits including whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in accordance with Subpart F of this part, and the extent to which the same or similar subaward has been audited as a major program;

(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and

######## e.g.,

(4) The extent and results of Federal awarding agency monitoring (if the subrecipient also receives Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency).

(c) Consider imposing specific subaward conditions upon a subrecipient if appropriate as described in § 200.208.

(d) Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes, in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward; and that subaward performance goals are achieved. Pass-through entity monitoring of the subrecipient must include:

(1) Reviewing financial and performance reports required by the pass-through entity.

(2) Following-up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity detected through audits, on-site reviews, and written confirmation from the subrecipient, highlighting the status of actions planned or taken to address Single Audit findings related to the particular subaward.

(3) Issuing a management decision for applicable audit findings pertaining only to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by § 200.521.

######## e.g.,

(4) The pass-through entity is responsible for resolving audit findings specifically related to the subaward and not responsible for resolving crosscutting findings. If a subrecipient has a current Single Audit report posted in the Federal Audit Clearinghouse and has not otherwise been excluded from receipt of Federal funding (has been debarred or suspended), the pass-through entity may rely on the subrecipient's cognizant audit agency or cognizant oversight agency to perform audit follow-up and make management decisions related to cross-cutting findings in accordance with section § 200.513(a)(3)(vii). Such reliance does not eliminate the responsibility of the pass-through entity to issue subawards that conform to agency and award-specific requirements, to manage risk through ongoing subaward monitoring, and to monitor the status of the findings that are specifically related to the subaward.

(e) Depending upon the pass-through entity's assessment of risk posed by the subrecipient (as described in paragraph (b) of this section), the following monitoring tools may be useful for the pass-through entity to ensure proper accountability and compliance with program requirements and achievement of performance goals:

(1) Providing subrecipients with training and technical assistance on program-related matters; and

(2) Performing on-site reviews of the subrecipient's program operations;

(3) Arranging for agreed-upon-procedures engagements as described in § 200.425.

(f) Verify that every subrecipient is audited as required by Subpart F of this part when it is expected that the subrecipient's Federal awards expended during the respective fiscal year equaled or exceeded the threshold set forth in § 200.501.

(g) Consider whether the results of the subrecipient's audits, on-site reviews, or other monitoring indicate conditions that necessitate adjustments to the pass-through entity's own records.

(h) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in § 200.339 of this part and in program regulations.

####### § 200.333 Fixed amount subawards.

With prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, a pass-through entity may provide subawards based on fixed amounts up to the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, provided that the subawards meet the requirements for fixed amount awards in § 200.201.

###### Record Retention and Access

####### § 200.334 Retention requirements for records.

Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other non-Federal entity records pertinent to a Federal award must be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for Federal awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, respectively, as reported to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient. Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities must not impose any other record retention requirements upon non-Federal entities. The only exceptions are the following:

(a) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

(b) When the non-Federal entity is notified in writing by the Federal awarding agency, cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period.

(c) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

(d) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the non-Federal entity.

(e) Records for program income transactions after the period of performance. In some cases recipients must report program income after the period of performance. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the program income starts from the end of the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in which the program income is earned.

(f) Indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocations plans. This paragraph applies to the following types of documents and their supporting records: Indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

######## If submitted for negotiation.

(1)If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the pass-through entity) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.

######## If not submitted for negotiation.

(2)If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the pass-through entity) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

####### § 200.335 Requests for transfer of records.

The Federal awarding agency must request transfer of certain records to its custody from the non-Federal entity when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, the Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for the non-Federal entity to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.

####### § 200.336 Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information.

The Federal awarding agency and the non-Federal entity should, whenever practicable, collect, transmit, and store Federal award-related information in open and machine-readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper in accordance with applicable legislative requirements. A machine-readable format is a format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a web browser or computer system. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must always provide or accept paper versions of Federal award-related information to and from the non-Federal entity upon request. If paper copies are submitted, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must not require more than an original and two copies. When original records are electronic and cannot be altered, there is no need to create and retain paper copies. When original records are paper, electronic versions may be substituted through the use of duplication or other forms of electronic media provided that they are subject to periodic quality control reviews, provide reasonable safeguards against alteration, and remain readable.

####### § 200.337 Access to records.

######## Records of non-Federal entities.

(a)The Federal awarding agency, Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, and the pass-through entity, or any of their authorized representatives, must have the right of access to any documents, papers, or other records of the non-Federal entity which are pertinent to the Federal award, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts. The right also includes timely and reasonable access to the non-Federal entity's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents.

######## Extraordinary and rare circumstances.

(b)Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include review of the true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. When access to the true name of victims of a crime is necessary, appropriate steps to protect this sensitive information must be taken by both the non-Federal entity and the Federal awarding agency. Any such access, other than under a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head of the Federal awarding agency or delegate.

######## Expiration of right of access.

(c)The rights of access in this section are not limited to the required retention period but last as long as the records are retained. Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities must not impose any other access requirements upon non-Federal entities.

####### § 200.338 Restrictions on public access to records.

No Federal awarding agency may place restrictions on the non-Federal entity that limit public access to the records of the non-Federal entity pertinent to a Federal award, except for protected personally identifiable information (PII) or when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records will be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not apply to those records that remain under a non-Federal entity's control except as required under § 200.315. Unless required by Federal, state, local, and tribal statute, non-Federal entities are not required to permit public access to their records. The non-Federal entity's records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA and applicable exemptions.

###### Remedies for Noncompliance

####### § 200.339 Remedies for noncompliance.

If a non-Federal entity fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may impose additional conditions, as described in § 200.208. If the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:

(a) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the non-Federal entity or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(b) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

(c) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the Federal award.

(d) Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and Federal awarding agency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a Federal awarding agency).

(e) Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program.

(f) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

####### § 200.340 Termination.

(a) The Federal award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:

(1) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, if a non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a Federal award;

(2) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, to the greatest extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities;

(3) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the non-Federal entity, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated;

(4) By the non-Federal entity upon sending to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the Federal award or subaward will not accomplish the purposes for which the Federal award was made, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or

(5) By the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity pursuant to termination provisions included in the Federal award.

(b) A Federal awarding agency should clearly and unambiguously specify termination provisions applicable to each Federal award, in applicable regulations or in the award, consistent with this section.

(c) When a Federal awarding agency terminates a Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the Federal award terms and conditions, the Federal awarding agency must report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS).

(1) The information required under paragraph (c) of this section is not to be reported to designated integrity and performance system until the non-Federal entity either-

(i) Has exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision, see § 200.342; or

(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal awarding agency that it intends to appeal the Federal awarding agency's decision to terminate.

(2) If a Federal awarding agency, after entering information into the designated integrity and performance system about a termination, subsequently:

(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal awarding agency must correct the information in the system within three business days;

(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal awarding agencies, the Federal awarding agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.

(3) Federal awarding agencies, must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of designated integrity and performance system that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If the non-Federal entity asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal awarding agency who posted the information, that some of the information made publicly available is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal awarding agency who posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.

(d) When a Federal award is terminated or partially terminated, both the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in §§ 200.344 and 200.345.

####### § 200.341 Notification of termination requirement.

(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must provide to the non-Federal entity a notice of termination.

(b) If the Federal award is terminated for the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, the notification must state that-

(1) The termination decision will be reported to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS);

(2) The information will be available in the OMB-designated integrity and performance system for a period of five years from the date of the termination, then archived;

(3) Federal awarding agencies that consider making a Federal award to the non-Federal entity during that five year period must consider that information in judging whether the non-Federal entity is qualified to receive the Federal award, when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;

(4) The non-Federal entity may comment on any information the OMB-designated integrity and performance system contains about the non-Federal entity for future consideration by Federal awarding agencies. The non-Federal entity may submit comments to the awardee integrity and performance portal accessible through SAM (currently (CPARS).

(5) Federal awarding agencies will consider non-Federal entity comments when determining whether the non-Federal entity is qualified for a future Federal award.

(c) Upon termination of a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency must provide the information required under FFATA to the Federal website established to fulfill the requirements of FFATA, and update or notify any other relevant governmentwide systems or entities of any indications of poor performance as required by 41 U.S.C. 417b and 31 U.S.C. 3321 and implementing guidance at 2 CFR part 77 (forthcoming at time of publication). See also the requirements for Suspension and Debarment at 2 CFR part 180.

####### § 200.342 Opportunities to object, hearings, and appeals.

Upon taking any remedy for non-compliance, the Federal awarding agency must provide the non-Federal entity an opportunity to object and provide information and documentation challenging the suspension or termination action, in accordance with written processes and procedures published by the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must comply with any requirements for hearings, appeals or other administrative proceedings to which the non-Federal entity is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

####### § 200.343 Effects of suspension and termination.

Costs to the non-Federal entity resulting from financial obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity during a suspension or after termination of a Federal award or subaward are not allowable unless the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. However, costs during suspension or after termination are allowable if:

(a) The costs result from financial obligations which were properly incurred by the non-Federal entity before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it; and

(b) The costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired normally at the end of the period of performance in which the termination takes effect.

###### Closeout

####### § 200.344 Closeout.

The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity will close out the Federal award when it determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the Federal award have been completed by the non-Federal entity. If the non-Federal entity fails to complete the requirements, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity will proceed to close out the Federal award with the information available. This section specifies the actions the non-Federal entity and Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must take to complete this process at the end of the period of performance.

(a) The recipient must submit, no later than 120 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. A subrecipient must submit to the pass-through entity, no later than 90 calendar days (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient) after the end date of the period of performance, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions when requested and justified by the non-Federal entity, as applicable.

(b) Unless the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity authorizes an extension, a non-Federal entity must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under the Federal award no later than 120 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance as specified in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(c) The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must make prompt payments to the non-Federal entity for costs meeting the requirements in Subpart E of this part under the Federal award being closed out.

(d) The non-Federal entity must promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity paid in advance or paid and that are not authorized to be retained by the non-Federal entity for use in other projects. See OMB Circular A-129 and see § 200.346, for requirements regarding unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

(e) Consistent with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

(f) The non-Federal entity must account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.330.

(g) When a recipient or subrecipient completes all closeout requirements, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must promptly complete all closeout actions for Federal awards. The Federal awarding agency must make every effort to complete closeout actions no later than one year after the end of the period of performance unless otherwise directed by authorizing statutes. Closeout actions include Federal awarding agency actions in the grants management and payment systems.

(h) If the non-Federal entity does not submit all reports in accordance with this section and the terms and conditions of the Federal Award, the Federal awarding agency must proceed to close out with the information available within one year of the period of performance end date.

(i) If the non-Federal entity does not submit all reports in accordance with this section within one year of the period of performance end date, the Federal awarding agency must report the non-Federal entity's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award with the OMB-designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). Federal awarding agencies may also pursue other enforcement actions per § 200.339.

###### Post-Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities

####### § 200.345 Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

(a) The closeout of a Federal award does not affect any of the following:

(1) The right of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must make any cost disallowance determination and notify the non-Federal entity within the record retention period.

(2) The requirement for the non-Federal entity to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions including final indirect cost rate adjustments.

(3) The ability of the Federal awarding agency to make financial adjustments to a previously closed award such as resolving indirect cost payments and making final payments.

(4) Audit requirements in subpart F of this part.

(5) Property management and disposition requirements in §§ 200.310 through 200.316 of this subpart.

(6) Records retention as required in §§ 200.334 through 200.337 of this subpart.

(b) After closeout of the Federal award, a relationship created under the Federal award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity, provided the responsibilities of the non-Federal entity referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the non-Federal entity, as appropriate.

###### Collection of Amounts Due

####### § 200.346 Collection of amounts due.

(a) Any funds paid to the non-Federal entity in excess of the amount to which the non-Federal entity is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the Federal award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within 90 calendar days after demand, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by:

(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements;

(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the non-Federal entity; or

(3) Other action permitted by Federal statute.

(b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal awarding agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR parts 900 through 999). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

###### § 200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements.

(a) The Federal awarding agency must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, and public policy requirements: Including, but not limited to, those protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, the environment, and prohibiting discrimination. The Federal awarding agency must communicate to the non-Federal entity all relevant public policy requirements, including those in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them either directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(b) The non-Federal entity is responsible for complying with all requirements of the Federal award. For all Federal awards, this includes the provisions of FFATA, which includes requirements on executive compensation, and also requirements implementing the Act for the non-Federal entity at 2 CFR parts 25 and 170. See also statutory requirements for whistleblower protections at 10 U.S.C. 2409, 41 U.S.C. 4712, and 10 U.S.C. 2324, 41 U.S.C. 4304 and 4310.

###### § 200.301 Performance measurement.

(a) The Federal awarding agency must measure the recipient's performance to show achievement of program goals and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster adoption of promising practices. Program goals and objectives should be derived from program planning and design. See § 200.202 for more information. Where appropriate, the Federal award may include specific program goals, indicators, targets, baseline data, data collection, or expected outcomes (such as outputs, or services performance or public impacts of any of these) with an expected timeline for accomplishment. Where applicable, this should also include any performance measures or independent sources of data that may be used to measure progress. The Federal awarding agency will determine how performance progress is measured, which may differ by program. Performance measurement progress must be both measured and reported. See § 200.329 for more information on monitoring program performance. The Federal awarding agency may include program-specific requirements, as applicable. These requirements must be aligned, to the extent permitted by law, with the Federal awarding agency strategic goals, strategic objectives or performance goals that are relevant to the program. See also OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget Part 6.

(b) The Federal awarding agency should provide recipients with clear performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline data as described in § 200.211. Performance reporting frequency and content should be established to not only allow the Federal awarding agency to understand the recipient progress but also to facilitate identification of promising practices among recipients and build the evidence upon which the Federal awarding agency's program and performance decisions are made. See § 200.328 for more information on reporting program performance.

####### e.g.;

(c) This provision is designed to operate in tandem with evidence-related statutes (The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, which emphasizes collaboration and coordination to advance data and evidence-building functions in the Federal government). The Federal awarding agency should also specify any requirements of award recipients' participation in a federally funded evaluation, and any evaluation activities required to be conducted by the Federal award.

###### § 200.302 Financial management.

(a) Each state must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with state laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the state's own funds. In addition, the state's and the other non-Federal entity's financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.450.

(b) The financial management system of each non-Federal entity must provide for the following (see also §§ 200.334, 200.335, 200.336, and 200.337):

(1) Identification, in its accounts, of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass-through entity, if any.

(2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in §§ 200.328 and 200.329. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient may develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. Similarly, a pass-through entity must not require a subrecipient to establish an accrual accounting system and must allow the subrecipient to develop accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(3) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-funded activities. These records must contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, financial obligations, unobligated balances, assets, expenditures, income and interest and be supported by source documentation.

(4) Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. The non-Federal entity must adequately safeguard all assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized purposes. See § 200.303.

(5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award.

(6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of § 200.305.

(7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E of this part and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

###### § 200.303 Internal controls.

The non-Federal entity must:

(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government" issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the "Internal Control Integrated Framework", issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

(b) Comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.

(c) Evaluate and monitor the non-Federal entity's compliance with statutes, regulations and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified including noncompliance identified in audit findings.

(e) Take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and other information the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or the non-Federal entity considers sensitive consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and responsibility over confidentiality.

###### § 200.304 Bonds.

The Federal awarding agency may include a provision on bonding, insurance, or both in the following circumstances:

(a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the non-Federal entity are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

(b) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

(c) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223.

###### § 200.305 Federal payment.

(a) For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 4A-2000, "Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies".

(b) For non-Federal entities other than states, payments methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury or the pass-through entity and the disbursement by the non-Federal entity whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, or issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means. See also § 200.302(b)(6). Except as noted elsewhere in this part, Federal agencies must require recipients to use only OMB-approved, governmentwide information collection requests to request payment.

(1) The non-Federal entity must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the non-Federal entity, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a non-Federal entity must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the non-Federal entity in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the non-Federal entity for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The non-Federal entity must make timely payment to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.

(2) Whenever possible, advance payments must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.

(i) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer and must comply with applicable guidance in 31 CFR part 208.

(ii) Non-Federal entities must be authorized to submit requests for advance payments and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used, and as often as they like when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).

(3) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in this paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the Federal awarding agency sets a specific condition per § 200.208, or when the non-Federal entity requests payment by reimbursement. This method may be used on any Federal award for construction, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.

(4) If the non-Federal entity cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the non-Federal entity lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the non-Federal entity to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the non-Federal entity's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance method of payment requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients in order to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment must not be used by the pass-through entity if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(5) To the extent available, the non-Federal entity must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(6) Unless otherwise required by Federal statutes, payments for allowable costs by non-Federal entities must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless the conditions of § 200.208, subpart D of this part, including § 200.339, or one or more of the following applies:

(i) The non-Federal entity has failed to comply with the project objectives, Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(ii) The non-Federal entity is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, "Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables." Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may, upon reasonable notice, inform the non-Federal entity that payments must not be made for financial obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

(iii) A payment withheld for failure to comply with Federal award conditions, but without suspension of the Federal award, must be released to the non-Federal entity upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 200.343.

(iv) A payment must not be made to a non-Federal entity for amounts that are withheld by the non-Federal entity from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. A payment must be made when the non-Federal entity actually disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.

(7) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of advance payments under Federal awards are as follows.

(i) The Federal awarding agency and pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a non-Federal entity or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to the non-Federal entity. However, the non-Federal entity must be able to account for funds received, obligated, and expended.

(ii) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

(8) The non-Federal entity must maintain advance payments of Federal awards in interest-bearing accounts, unless the following apply:

(i) The non-Federal entity receives less than $250,000 in Federal awards per year.

(ii) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances.

(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts.

(9) Interest earned amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal entity for administrative expense. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

(i) For returning interest on Federal awards paid through PMS, the refund should:

(A) Provide an explanation stating that the refund is for interest;

(B) List the PMS Payee Account Number(s) (PANs);

(C) List the Federal award number(s) for which the interest was earned; and

(D) Make returns payable to: Department of Health and Human Services.

(ii) For returning interest on Federal awards not paid through PMS, the refund should:

(A) Provide an explanation stating that the refund is for interest;

(B) Include the name of the awarding agency;

(C) List the Federal award number(s) for which the interest was earned; and

(D) Make returns payable to: Department of Health and Human Services.

(10) Funds, principal, and excess cash returns must be directed to the original Federal agency payment system. The non-Federal entity should review instructions from the original Federal agency payment system. Returns should include the following information:

(i) Payee Account Number (PAN), if the payment originated from PMS, or Agency information to indicate whom to credit the funding if the payment originated from ASAP, NSF, or another Federal agency payment system.

(ii) PMS document number and subaccount(s), if the payment originated from PMS, or relevant account numbers if the payment originated from another Federal agency payment system.

####### e.g.,

(iii) The reason for the return (excess cash, funds not spent, interest, part interest part other, etc.)

(11) When returning funds or interest to PMS you must include the following as applicable:

(i) For ACH Returns:

(ii) For Fedwire Returns:

Please note that the organization initiating payment is likely to incur a charge from their Financial Institution for this type of payment.

(iii) For International ACH Returns:

(iv) For recipients that do not have electronic remittance capability, please make checkpayable to: "The Department of Health and Human Services."

Please allow 4-6 weeks for processing of a payment by check to be applied to the appropriate PMS account.

###### § 200.306 Cost sharing or matching.

(a) Under Federal research proposals, voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected. It cannot be used as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals, but may be considered if it is both in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations and specified in a notice of funding opportunity. Criteria for considering voluntary committed cost sharing and any other program policy factors that may be used to determine who may receive a Federal award must be explicitly described in the notice of funding opportunity. See also §§ 200.414 and 200.204 and appendix I to this part.

(b) For all Federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the non-Federal entity's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria:

(1) Are verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records;

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;

(3) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives;

(4) Are allowable under subpart E of this part;

(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;

(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency; and

(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.

(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the non-Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

(d) Values for non-Federal entity contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E of this part. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes the non-Federal entity to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching must be the lesser of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the non-Federal entity's accounting records at the time of donation.

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section at the time of donation.

(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the non-Federal entity. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the non-Federal entity, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the non-Federal entity competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable may be included in the valuation.

(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 200.414(d) provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.

(g) Donated property from third parties may include such items as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated property included in the cost sharing or matching share must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

(h) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for third-party-donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the non-Federal entity may differ according to the purpose of the Federal award, if paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section applies.

(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the non-Federal entity in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges. See also § 200.420.

(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the non-Federal entity, with the following qualifications:

####### e.g.,

(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the non-Federal entity as established by an independent appraiser (certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the non-Federal entity as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) (Uniform Act) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, "Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs".

(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.

(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.

(j) For third-party in-kind contributions, the fair market value of goods and services must be documented and to the extent feasible supported by the same methods used internally by the non-Federal entity.

(k) For IHEs, see also OMB memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, Clarification of OMB A-21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.

###### § 200.307 Program income.

####### General.

(a)Non-Federal entities are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs where appropriate.

####### Cost of generating program income.

(b)If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.

####### Governmental revenues.

(c)Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a non-Federal entity are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the Federal award or Federal awarding agency regulations as program income.

####### Property.

(d)Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies are not program income; such proceeds will be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards §§ 200.311, 200.313, and 200.314, or as specifically identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

####### Use of program income.

(e)If the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, or give prior approval for how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(1) of this section must apply. For Federal awards made to IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, if the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award how program income is to be used, paragraph (e)(2) of this section must apply. In specifying alternatives to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, the Federal awarding agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When the Federal awarding agency authorizes the approaches in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any amounts specified must also be deducted from expenditures.

####### Deduction.

(1)Ordinarily program income must be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income must be used for current costs unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes otherwise. Program income that the non-Federal entity did not anticipate at the time of the Federal award must be used to reduce the Federal award and non-Federal entity contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.

####### Addition.

(2)With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency (except for IHEs and nonprofit research institutions, as described in this paragraph (e)) program income may be added to the Federal award by the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. The program income must be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the Federal award.

####### Cost sharing or matching.

(3)With prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the Federal award. The amount of the Federal award remains the same.

####### Income after the period of performance.

(f)There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of income earned after the end of the period of performance for the Federal award, unless the Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award provide otherwise. The Federal awarding agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the period of performance as part of the grant closeout process. See also § 200.344.

####### License fees and royalties.

(g)Unless the Federal statute, regulations, or terms and conditions for the Federal award provide otherwise, the non-Federal entity is not accountable to the Federal awarding agency with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under a Federal award to which 37 CFR part 401 is applicable.

###### § 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans.

####### Federal share

(a) The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share (see definition forin § 200.1) or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. The budget and program plans include considerations for performance and program evaluation purposes whenever required in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget or project scope or objective, and request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

(c) For non-construction Federal awards, recipients must request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for the following program or budget-related reasons:

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or the Federal award.

(3) The disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E of this part as applicable.

(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other categories of expense.

(6) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal awards, the subawarding, transferring or contracting out of any work under a Federal award, including fixed amount subawards as described in § 200.333. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.

(7) Changes in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-Federal entity.

(8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB. See also §§ 200.102 and 200.407.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section, the Federal awarding agency is authorized, at its option, to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approvals contained in subparts D and E of this part. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following:

####### i.e.,

(1) Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award. Expenses more than 90 calendar days pre-award require prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All costs incurred before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award are at the recipient's risk (the Federal awarding agency is not required to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive a Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). See also § 200.458.

(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the end of the period of performance specified in the Federal award. This one-time extension must not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. Extensions require explicit prior Federal awarding agency approval when:

(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension.

(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.

(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods.

####### i.e.,

(4) For Federal awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the Federal award or in the Federal awarding agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in this paragraph (e) are automatically waived (recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies.

(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for Federal awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency cannot permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation.

(g) All other changes to non-construction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (c) of this section, do not require prior approval (see also § 200.407).

(h) For construction Federal awards, the recipient must request prior written approval promptly from the Federal awarding agency for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies:

(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.

(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in subpart E.

(4) No other prior approval requirements for budget revisions may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB.

(5) When a Federal awarding agency makes a Federal award that provides support for construction and non-construction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to obtain prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

(i) When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in the application, unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.

(j) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Federal awarding agency must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

###### § 200.309 Modifications to Period of Performance.

If a Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity approves an extension, or if a recipient extends under § 200.308(e)(2), the Period of Performance will be amended to end at the completion of the extension. If a termination occurs, the Period of Performance will be amended to end upon the effective date of termination. If a renewal award is issued, a distinct Period of Performance will begin.

##### Subpart E - Cost Principles

###### General Provisions

####### § 200.400 Policy guide.

The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental premises that:

(a) The non-Federal entity is responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Federal award through the application of sound management practices.

(b) The non-Federal entity assumes responsibility for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with underlying agreements, program objectives, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(c) The non-Federal entity, in recognition of its own unique combination of staff, facilities, and experience, has the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of sound organization and management techniques may be necessary in order to assure proper and efficient administration of the Federal award.

(d) The application of these cost principles should require no significant changes in the internal accounting policies and practices of the non-Federal entity. However, the accounting practices of the non-Federal entity must be consistent with these cost principles and support the accumulation of costs as required by the principles, and must provide for adequate documentation to support costs charged to the Federal award.

######## indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs

(e) In reviewing, negotiating and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for indirect costs should generally assure that the non-Federal entity is applying these cost accounting principles on a consistent basis during their review and negotiation of indirect cost proposals. Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a given cost item by the non-Federal entity, the reasonableness and equity of such treatments should be fully considered. See the definition ofin § 200.1 of this part.

(f) For non-Federal entities that educate and engage students in research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of these principles.

(g) The non-Federal entity may not earn or keep any profit resulting from Federal financial assistance, unless explicitly authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.307.

####### § 200.401 Application.

######## General.

(a)These principles must be used in determining the allowable costs of work performed by the non-Federal entity under Federal awards. These principles also must be used by the non-Federal entity as a guide in the pricing of fixed-price contracts and subcontracts where costs are used in determining the appropriate price. The principles do not apply to:

(1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on such items as education allowance or published tuition rates and fees.

(2) For IHEs, capitation awards, which are awards based on case counts or number of beneficiaries according to the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(3) Fixed amount awards. See also § 200.1 Definitions and 200.201.

(4) Federal awards to hospitals (see appendix IX to this part).

(5) Other awards under which the non-Federal entity is not required to account to the Federal Government for actual costs incurred.

######## Federal contract.,e.g.,

(b)Where a Federal contract awarded to a non-Federal entity is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), it incorporates the applicable CAS clauses, Standards, and CAS administration requirements per the 48 CFR Chapter 99 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30). CAS applies directly to the CAS-covered contract and the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 CFR parts 9904 or 9905 takes precedence over the cost principles in this subpart E with respect to the allocation of costs. When a contract with a non-Federal entity is subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS 414-48 CFR 9904.414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital, and CAS 417-48 CFR 9904.417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction), apply rather the allowability provisions of § 200.449. In complying with those requirements, the non-Federal entity's application of cost accounting practices for estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs for other Federal awards and other cost objectives under the CAS-covered contract still must be consistent with its cost accounting practices for the CAS-covered contracts. In all cases, only one set of accounting records needs to be maintained for the allocation of costs by the non-Federal entity.

######## Exemptions.

(c)Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be considered to be similar to for-profit entities for purpose of applicability of cost principles. Such nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles applicable to for-profit entities located at 48 CFR 31.2. A listing of these organizations is contained in appendix VIII to this part. Other organizations, as approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs, may be added from time to time.

###### Basic Considerations

####### § 200.402 Composition of costs.

######## Total cost.

The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs less any applicable credits.

####### § 200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs.

Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under Federal awards:

(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.

(b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to types or amount of cost items.

(c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally-financed and other activities of the non-Federal entity.

(d) Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost.

(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for state and local governments and Indian tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part.

(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a prior period. See also § 200.306(b).

(g) Be adequately documented. See also §§ 200.300 through 200.309 of this part.

(h) Cost must be incurred during the approved budget period. The Federal awarding agency is authorized, at its discretion, to waive prior written approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods pursuant to § 200.308(e)(3).

####### § 200.404 Reasonable costs.

A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. The question of reasonableness is particularly important when the non-Federal entity is predominantly federally-funded. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to:

(a) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the operation of the non-Federal entity or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award.

(b) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as: sound business practices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, state, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the Federal award.

(c) Market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic area.

(d) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their responsibilities to the non-Federal entity, its employees, where applicable its students or membership, the public at large, and the Federal Government.

(e) Whether the non-Federal entity significantly deviates from its established practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs, which may unjustifiably increase the Federal award's cost.

####### § 200.405 Allocable costs.

(a) A cost is allocable to a particular Federal award or other cost objective if the goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to that Federal award or cost objective in accordance with relative benefits received. This standard is met if the cost:

(1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;

(2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the non-Federal entity and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; and

(3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the non-Federal entity and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with the principles in this subpart.

(b) All activities which benefit from the non-Federal entity's indirect (F&A) cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the non-Federal entity or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs.

(c) Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award under the principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal awards, or for other reasons. However, this prohibition would not preclude the non-Federal entity from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.

(d) Direct cost allocation principles: If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.439.

(e) If the contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to the contract pursuant to the Cost Accounting Standards. To the extent that CAS is applicable, the allocation of costs in accordance with CAS takes precedence over the allocation provisions in this part.

####### § 200.406 Applicable credits.

(a) Applicable credits refer to those receipts or reduction-of-expenditure-type transactions that offset or reduce expense items allocable to the Federal award as direct or indirect (F&A) costs. Examples of such transactions are: purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the non-Federal entity relate to allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate.

(b) In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance activities or service operations of the non-Federal entity should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items (including any amounts used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements) must be recognized in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to the Federal award. (See §§ 200.436 and 200.468, for areas of potential application in the matter of Federal financing of activities.)

####### § 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval).

Under any given Federal award, the reasonableness and allocability of certain items of costs may be difficult to determine. In order to avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, the non-Federal entity may seek the prior written approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs or the Federal awarding agency in advance of the incurrence of special or unusual costs. Prior written approval should include the timeframe or scope of the agreement. The absence of prior written approval on any element of cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness or allocability of that element, unless prior approval is specifically required for allowability as described under certain circumstances in the following sections of this part:

(a) § 200.201 Use of grant agreements (including fixed amount awards), cooperative agreements, and contracts, paragraph (b)(5);

(b) § 200.306 Cost sharing or matching;

(c) § 200.307 Program income;

(d) § 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans;

(e) § 200.311 Real property;

(f) § 200.313 Equipment;

(g) § 200.333 Fixed amount subawards;

(h) § 200.413 Direct costs, paragraph (c);

(i) § 200.430 Compensation-personal services, paragraph (h);

(j) § 200.431 Compensation-fringe benefits;

(k) § 200.438 Entertainment costs;

(l) § 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures;

(m) § 200.440 Exchange rates;

(n) § 200.441 Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements;

(o) § 200.442 Fund raising and investment management costs;

(p) § 200.445 Goods or services for personal use;

(q) § 200.447 Insurance and indemnification;

(r) § 200.454 Memberships, subscriptions, and professional activity costs, paragraph (c);

(s) § 200.455 Organization costs;

(t) § 200.456 Participant support costs;

(u) § 200.458 Pre-award costs;

(v) § 200.462 Rearrangement and reconversion costs;

(w) § 200.467 Selling and marketing costs;

(x) § 200.470 Taxes (including Value Added Tax); and

(y) § 200.475 Travel costs.

####### § 200.408 Limitation on allowance of costs.

The Federal award may be subject to statutory requirements that limit the allowability of costs. When the maximum amount allowable under a limitation is less than the total amount determined in accordance with the principles in this part, the amount not recoverable under the Federal award may not be charged to the Federal award.

####### § 200.409 Special considerations.

In addition to the basic considerations regarding the allowability of costs highlighted in this subtitle, other subtitles in this part describe special considerations and requirements applicable to states, local governments, Indian tribes, and IHEs. In addition, certain provisions among the items of cost in this subpart are only applicable to certain types of non-Federal entities, as specified in the following sections:

(a) Direct and Indirect (F&A) Costs (§§ 200.412-200.415) of this subpart;

(b) Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes (§§ 200.416 and 200.417) of this subpart; and

(c) Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education (§§ 200.418 and 200.419) of this subpart.

####### § 200.410 Collection of unallowable costs.

Payments made for costs determined to be unallowable by either the Federal awarding agency, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity, either as direct or indirect costs, must be refunded (including interest) to the Federal Government in accordance with instructions from the Federal agency that determined the costs are unallowable unless Federal statute or regulation directs otherwise. See also §§ 200.300 through 200.309 in subpart D of this part.

####### § 200.411 Adjustment of previously negotiated indirect (F&A) cost rates containing unallowable costs.

(a) Negotiated indirect (F&A) cost rates based on a proposal later found to have included costs that:

(1) Are unallowable as specified by Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award; or

(2) Are unallowable because they are not allocable to the Federal award(s), must be adjusted, or a refund must be made, in accordance with the requirements of this section. These adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the proposals used to establish the rates and do not constitute a reopening of the rate negotiation. The adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).

(b) For rates covering a future fiscal year of the non-Federal entity, the unallowable costs will be removed from the indirect (F&A) cost pools and the rates appropriately adjusted.

(c) For rates covering a past period, the Federal share of the unallowable costs will be computed for each year involved and a cash refund (including interest chargeable in accordance with applicable regulations) will be made to the Federal Government. If cash refunds are made for past periods covered by provisional or fixed rates, appropriate adjustments will be made when the rates are finalized to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs by the Federal Government.

(d) For rates covering the current period, either a rate adjustment or a refund, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, must be required by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The choice of method must be at the discretion of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, based on its judgment as to which method would be most practical.

(e) The amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in each year's rate will be assumed to be the same as the amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in the base year proposal used to establish the rate.

###### Direct and Indirect (F&A) Costs

####### § 200.412 Classification of costs.

There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect (F&A) under every accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost incurred for the same purpose be treated consistently in like circumstances either as a direct or an indirect (F&A) cost in order to avoid possible double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect (F&A) costs charged to Federal awards are provided in this subpart.

####### § 200.413 Direct costs.

######## General.

(a)Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as either direct or indirect (F&A) costs. See also § 200.405.

######## Application to Federal awards.

(b)Identification with the Federal award rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect (F&A) costs of Federal awards. Typical costs charged directly to a Federal award are the compensation of employees who work on that award, their related fringe benefit costs, the costs of materials and other items of expense incurred for the Federal award. If directly related to a specific award, certain costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct costs. Examples include extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities, program evaluation costs, or other institutional service operations.

(c) The salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect (F&A) costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project or activity;

(2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity;

(3) Such costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency; and

(4) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.

######## Minor items.

(d)Any direct cost of minor amount may be treated as an indirect (F&A) cost for reasons of practicality where such accounting treatment for that item of cost is consistently applied to all Federal and non-Federal cost objectives.

(e) The costs of certain activities are not allowable as charges to Federal awards. However, even though these costs are unallowable for purposes of computing charges to Federal awards, they nonetheless must be treated as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect (F&A) cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of the non-Federal entity's indirect costs if they represent activities which:

(1) Include the salaries of personnel,

(2) Occupy space, and

(3) Benefit from the non-Federal entity's indirect (F&A) costs.

(f) For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities performed by the non-Federal entity primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public when significant and necessary to the non-Federal entity's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect (F&A) costs. Some examples of these types of activities include:

(1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See also § 200.454.

(2) Providing services and information to members, legislative or administrative bodies, or the public. See also §§ 200.454 and 200.450.

(3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See also §§ 200.421 and 200.450.

(4) Conferences except those held to conduct the general administration of the non-Federal entity. See also § 200.432.

(5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in operation of the non-Federal entity. See also § 200.442.

(6) Administration of group benefits on behalf of members or clients, including life and hospital insurance, annuity or retirement plans, and financial aid. See also § 200.431.

####### § 200.414 Indirect (F&A) costs.

######## Facilities and administration classification.

(a)For major Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and major nonprofit organizations, indirect (F&A) costs must be classified within two broad categories: "Facilities" and "Administration." "Facilities" is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvement, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. "Administration" is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the director's office, accounting, personnel and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of "Facilities" (including cross allocations from other pools, where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the "Administration" category; for IHEs, they are included in the "Facilities" category. Major IHEs are defined as those required to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in appendix III to this part, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education paragraph C. 11. Major nonprofit organizations are those which receive more than $10 million dollars in direct Federal funding.

######## Diversity of nonprofit organizations.

(b)Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of nonprofit organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of cost which may be classified as indirect (F&A) cost in all situations. Identification with a Federal award rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect (F&A) costs of Federal awards. However, typical examples of indirect (F&A) cost for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.

######## Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated Indirect Cost Rates.

(c)(See also § 200.306.)

(1) The negotiated rates must be accepted by all Federal awarding agencies. A Federal awarding agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by a Federal awarding agency head or delegate based on documented justification as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(2) The Federal awarding agency head or delegate must notify OMB of any approved deviations.

(3) The Federal awarding agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.

(4) As required under § 200.204, the Federal awarding agency must include in the notice of funding opportunity the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement, matching, or cost share as approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into Federal awarding agency outreach activities with non-Federal entities prior to the posting of a notice of funding opportunity.

(d) Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in § 200.332(a)(4).

(e) Requirements for development and submission of indirect (F&A) cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in Appendices III-VII and Appendix IX as follows:

(1) Appendix III to Part 200-Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);

(2) Appendix IV to Part 200-Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;

(3) Appendix V to Part 200-State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;

(4) Appendix VI to Part 200-Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;

(5) Appendix VII to Part 200-States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and

(6) Appendix IX to Part 200-Hospital Cost Principles.

(f) In addition to the procedures outlined in the appendices in paragraph (e) of this section, any non-Federal entity that does not have a current negotiated (including provisional) rate, except for those non-Federal entities described in appendix VII to this part, paragraph D.1.b, may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) which may be used indefinitely. No documentation is required to justify the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate. As described in § 200.403, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time.

(g) Any non-Federal entity that has a current federally-negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of the rates in that agreement for a period of up to four years. This extension will be subject to the review and approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If an extension is granted the non-Federal entity may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. At the end of the 4-year extension, the non-Federal entity must re-apply to negotiate a rate. Subsequent one-time extensions (up to four years) are permitted if a renegotiation is completed between each extension request.

(h) The federally negotiated indirect rate, distribution base, and rate type for a non-Federal entity (except for the Indian tribes or tribal organizations, as defined in the Indian Self Determination, Education and Assistance Act, 25 U.S.C. 450b(1)) must be available publicly on an OMB-designated Federal website.

####### § 200.415 Required certifications.

Required certifications include:

(a) To assure that expenditures are proper and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award and approved project budgets, the annual and final fiscal reports or vouchers requesting payment under the agreements must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the non-Federal entity, which reads as follows: "By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812)."

(b) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect (F&A) cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect (F&A) cost rate proposal must comply with the following:

(1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect (F&A) cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the non-Federal entity, must be certified by the non-Federal entity using the Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan or Certificate of Indirect Costs as set forth in appendices III through VII, and IX of this part. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the non-Federal entity by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer of the non-Federal entity that submits the proposal.

(2) Unless the non-Federal entity has elected the option under § 200.414(f), the Federal Government may either disallow all indirect (F&A) costs or unilaterally establish such a plan or rate when the non-Federal entity fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing such a plan or rate in accordance with the requirements. Such a plan or rate may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When a cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate is unilaterally established by the Federal Government because the non-Federal entity failed to submit a certified proposal, the plan or rate established will be set to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.

(c) Certifications by nonprofit organizations as appropriate that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization as defined in § 200.414(a).

(d) See also § 200.450 for another required certification.

###### Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes

####### § 200.416 Cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals.

(a) For states, local governments and Indian tribes, certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., are provided to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process.

(b) Individual operating agencies (governmental department or agency), normally charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) proposal for each operating agency is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal awards. Indirect costs include:

(1) The indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards and

(2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.

(c) The requirements for development and submission of cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices V, VI and VII to this part.

####### § 200.417 Interagency service.

The cost of services provided by one agency to another within the governmental unit may include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro-rated share of indirect costs. A standard indirect cost allowance equal to ten percent of the direct salary and wage cost of providing the service (excluding overtime, shift premiums, and fringe benefits) may be used in lieu of determining the actual indirect costs of the service. These services do not include centralized services included in central service cost allocation plans as described in Appendix V to Part 200.

###### Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education

####### § 200.418 Costs incurred by states and local governments.

Costs incurred or paid by a state or local government on behalf of its IHEs for fringe benefit programs, such as pension costs and FICA and any other costs specifically incurred on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the IHEs, are allowable costs of such IHEs whether or not these costs are recorded in the accounting records of the institutions, subject to the following:

(a) The costs meet the requirements of § 200.402-411 of this subpart;

(b) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles in this part; and

(c) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.

####### § 200.419 Cost accounting standards and disclosure statement.

(a) An IHE that receive an aggregate total $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments subject to this subpart (as specified in § 200.101) in its most recently completed fiscal year must comply with the Cost Accounting Standards Board's cost accounting standards located at 48 CFR 9905.501, 9905.502, 9905.505, and 9905.506. CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts awarded to the IHEs are subject to the broader range of CAS requirements at 48 CFR 9900 through 9999 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30).

######## Disclosure statement.

(b)An IHE that receives an aggregate total $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments subject to this subpart (as specified in § 200.101) during its most recently completed fiscal year must disclose their cost accounting practices by filing a Disclosure Statement (DS-2), which is reproduced in Appendix III to Part 200. With the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, an IHE may meet the DS-2 submission by submitting the DS-2 for each business unit that received $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments.

(1) The DS-2 must be submitted to the cognizant agency for indirect costs with a copy to the IHE's cognizant agency for audit. The initial DS-2 and revisions to the DS-2 must be submitted in coordination with the IHE's indirect (F&A) rate proposal, unless an earlier submission is requested by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. IHEs with CAS-covered contracts or subcontracts meeting the dollar threshold in 48 CFR 9903.202-1(f) must submit their initial DS-2 or revisions no later than prior to the award of a CAS-covered contract or subcontract.

(2) An IHE must maintain an accurate DS-2 and comply with disclosed cost accounting practices. An IHE must file amendments to the DS-2 to the cognizant agency for indirect costs in advance of a disclosed practice being changed to comply with a new or modified standard, or when a practice is changed for other reasons. An IHE may proceed with implementing the change after it has notified the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs. If the change represents a variation from 2 CFR part 200, the change may require approval by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, in accordance with § 200.102(b). Amendments of a DS-2 may be submitted at any time. Resubmission of a complete, updated DS-2 is discouraged except when there are extensive changes to disclosed practices.

######## Cost and funding adjustments.

(3)Cost adjustments must be made by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if an IHE fails to comply with the cost policies in this part or fails to consistently follow its established or disclosed cost accounting practices when estimating, accumulating or reporting the costs of Federal awards, and the aggregate cost impact on Federal awards is material. The cost adjustment must normally be made on an aggregate basis for all affected Federal awards through an adjustment of the IHE's future F&A costs rates or other means considered appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Under the terms of CAS covered contracts, adjustments in the amount of funding provided may also be required when the estimated proposal costs were not determined in accordance with established cost accounting practices.

######## Overpayments.

(4)Excess amounts paid in the aggregate by the Federal Government under Federal awards due to a noncompliant cost accounting practice used to estimate, accumulate, or report costs must be credited or refunded, as deemed appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Interest applicable to the excess amounts paid in the aggregate during the period of noncompliance must also be determined and collected in accordance with applicable Federal agency regulations.

######## Compliant cost accounting practice changes.

(5)Changes from one compliant cost accounting practice to another compliant practice that are approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs may require cost adjustments if the change has a material effect on Federal awards and the changes are deemed appropriate by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

######## Responsibilities.

(6)The cognizant agency for indirect cost must:

(i) Determine cost adjustments for all Federal awards in the aggregate on behalf of the Federal Government. Actions of the cognizant agency for indirect cost in making cost adjustment determinations must be coordinated with all affected Federal awarding agencies to the extent necessary.

(ii) Prescribe guidelines and establish internal procedures to promptly determine on behalf of the Federal Government that a DS-2 adequately discloses the IHE's cost accounting practices and that the disclosed practices are compliant with applicable CAS and the requirements of this part.

(iii) Distribute to all affected Federal awarding agencies any DS-2 determination of adequacy or noncompliance.

###### General Provisions for Selected Items of Cost

####### § 200.420 Considerations for selected items of cost.

This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost, in addition to the requirements of Subtitle II of this subpart. These principles apply whether or not a particular item of cost is properly treated as direct cost or indirect (F&A) cost. Failure to mention a particular item of cost is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable; rather, determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related items of cost, and based on the principles described in §§ 200.402 through 200.411. In case of a discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the Federal award governs. Criteria outlined in § 200.403 must be applied in determining allowability. See also § 200.102.

####### § 200.421 Advertising and public relations.

(a) The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media include magazines, newspapers, radio and television, direct mail, exhibits, electronic or computer transmittals, and the like.

(b) The only allowable advertising costs are those which are solely for:

(1) The recruitment of personnel required by the non-Federal entity for performance of a Federal award (See also § 200.463);

(2) The procurement of goods and services for the performance of a Federal award;

(3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of a Federal award except when non-Federal entities are reimbursed for disposal costs at a predetermined amount; or

(4) Program outreach and other specific purposes necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal award.

(c) The term "public relations" includes community relations and means those activities dedicated to maintaining the image of the non-Federal entity or maintaining or promoting understanding and favorable relations with the community or public at large or any segment of the public.

(d) The only allowable public relations costs are:

(1) Costs specifically required by the Federal award;

(2) Costs of communicating with the public and press pertaining to specific activities or accomplishments which result from performance of the Federal award (these costs are considered necessary as part of the outreach effort for the Federal award); or

(3) Costs of conducting general liaison with news media and government public relations officers, to the extent that such activities are limited to communication and liaison necessary to keep the public informed on matters of public concern, such as notices of funding opportunities, financial matters, etc.

(e) Unallowable advertising and public relations costs include the following:

(1) All advertising and public relations costs other than as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section;

(2) Costs of meetings, conventions, convocations, or other events related to other activities of the entity (see also § 200.432), including:

(i) Costs of displays, demonstrations, and exhibits;

(ii) Costs of meeting rooms, hospitality suites, and other special facilities used in conjunction with shows and other special events; and

(iii) Salaries and wages of employees engaged in setting up and displaying exhibits, making demonstrations, and providing briefings;

(3) Costs of promotional items and memorabilia, including models, gifts, and souvenirs;

(4) Costs of advertising and public relations designed solely to promote the non-Federal entity.

####### § 200.422 Advisory councils.

Costs incurred by advisory councils or committees are unallowable unless authorized by statute, the Federal awarding agency or as an indirect cost where allocable to Federal awards. See § 200.444, applicable to States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

####### § 200.423 Alcoholic beverages.

Costs of alcoholic beverages are unallowable.

####### § 200.424 Alumni/ae activities.

Costs incurred by IHEs for, or in support of, alumni/ae activities are unallowable.

####### § 200.425 Audit services.

(a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by, and performed in accordance with, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), as implemented by requirements of this part, are allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable:

(1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part have not been conducted or have been conducted but not in accordance therewith; and

(2) Any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year.

(b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a non-Federal entity that does not currently have a Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal.

(c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon-procedures engagements to monitor subrecipients (in accordance with subpart D, §§ 200.331-333) who are exempted from the requirements of the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part. This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon-procedures engagements are:

(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS attestation standards;

(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and

(3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting.

####### § 200.426 Bad debts.

Bad debts (debts which have been determined to be uncollectable), including losses (whether actual or estimated) arising from uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable. Related collection costs, and related legal costs, arising from such debts after they have been determined to be uncollectable are also unallowable. See also § 200.428.

####### § 200.427 Bonding costs.

(a) Bonding costs arise when the Federal awarding agency requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others by reason of the act or default of the non-Federal entity. They arise also in instances where the non-Federal entity requires similar assurance, including: bonds as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds for employees and officials.

(b) Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award are allowable.

(c) Costs of bonding required by the non-Federal entity in the general conduct of its operations are allowable as an indirect cost to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.

####### § 200.428 Collections of improper payments.

The costs incurred by a non-Federal entity to recover improper payments are allowable as either direct or indirect costs, as appropriate. Amounts collected may be used by the non-Federal entity in accordance with cash management standards set forth in § 200.305.

####### § 200.429 Commencement and convocation costs.

For IHEs, costs incurred for commencements and convocations are unallowable, except as provided for in (B)(9) Student Administration and Services, in appendix III to this part, as activity costs.

####### § 200.430 Compensation - personal services.

######## General.

(a)Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include fringe benefits which are addressed in § 200.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this part, and that the total compensation for individual employees:

(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the non-Federal entity consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities;

(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with a non-Federal entity's laws and/or rules or written policies and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and

(3) Is determined and supported as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, when applicable.

######## Reasonableness.

(b)Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the non-Federal entity. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the other activities of the non-Federal entity, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the non-Federal entity competes for the kind of employees involved.

######## Professional activities outside the non-Federal entity.

(c)Unless an arrangement is specifically authorized by a Federal awarding agency, a non-Federal entity must follow its written non-Federal entity-wide policies and practices concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the non-Federal entity for non-organizational compensation. Where such non-Federal entity-wide written policies do not exist or do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require that the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards be allocated between:

(1) Non-Federal entity activities, and

(2) Non-organizational professional activities. If the Federal awarding agency considers the extent of non-organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and conditions of the Federal award, appropriate arrangements governing compensation will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

######## Unallowable costs.

(d)(1) Costs which are unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section solely on the basis that they constitute personnel compensation.

(2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with statute. For the amount of the ceiling for cost-reimbursement contracts, the covered compensation subject to the ceiling, the covered employees, and other relevant provisions, see 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(P), and 41 U.S.C. 1127 and 4304(a)(16). For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.

######## Special considerations.

(e)Special considerations in determining allowability of compensation will be given to any change in a non-Federal entity's compensation policy resulting in a substantial increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy.

######## Incentive compensation.

(f)Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, or efficient performance, suggestion awards, safety awards, etc., is allowable to the extent that the overall compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued pursuant to an agreement entered into in good faith between the non-Federal entity and the employees before the services were rendered, or pursuant to an established plan followed by the non-Federal entity so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment.

######## Nonprofit organizations.

(g)For compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the immediate families thereof, determination must be made that such compensation is reasonable for the actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings in excess of costs. This may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, allowances for off-site pay, incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials.

######## Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).

(h)(1) Certain conditions require special consideration and possible limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among such conditions are the following:

(i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable amounts for activities contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etc.), managing substances/chemicals, managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences.

(ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable under written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) need not be included in the records described in paragraph (i) of this section to directly charge payments of incidental activities, such activities must either be specifically provided for in the Federal award budget or receive prior written approval by the Federal awarding agency.

######## Salary basis.

(2)Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the academic year are allowable at the IBS rate. Except as noted in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of faculty at an institution. IBS is defined as the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS excludes any income that an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is prior approval by the Federal awarding agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award must not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member worked on the award.

######## Intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) consulting.

(3)Intra-IHE consulting by faculty should be undertaken as an IHE responsibility requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation, and the work performed by the faculty member is in addition to his or her regular responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are specifically provided for in the Federal award or approved in writing by the Federal awarding agency.

(4) Extra Service Pay normally represents overload compensation, subject to institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay is a result of Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements of paragraph (b) above. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) The non-Federal entity establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, not just those working on Federal awards.

(ii) The non-Federal entity establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS which is specific enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This may be described in appointment letters or other documentations.

(iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS rate of pay and the amount of additional work performed. See paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

(iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the non-Federal entity.

(v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards including extra service pay are subject to the Standards of Documentation as described in paragraph (i) of this section.

######## Periods outside the academic year.

(5)(i) Except as specified for teaching activity in paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section, charges for work performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base salary period will be at a rate not in excess of the IBS.

(ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in IBS period will be based on the normal written policy of the IHE governing compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods.

######## Part-time faculty.

(6)Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only part-time appointments will be determined at a rate not in excess of that regularly paid for part-time assignments.

######## Sabbatical leave costs.

(7)Rules for sabbatical leave are as follow:

(i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. Such costs will be allocated on an equitable basis among all related activities of the IHE.

(ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual experience under its sabbatical leave policy.

######## Salary rates for non-faculty members.

(8)Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn "extra service pay" in accordance with the non-Federal entity's written policy and consistent with paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.

######## Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses

(i)(1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must:

(i) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;

(ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the non-Federal entity;

(iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the non-Federal entity, not exceeding 100% of compensated activities (for IHE, this per the IHE's definition of IBS);

(iv) Encompass federally-assisted and all other activities compensated by the non-Federal entity on an integrated basis, but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in the non-Federal entity's written policy;

(v) Comply with the established accounting policies and practices of the non-Federal entity (See paragraph (h)(1)(ii) above for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and

(vi) [Reserved]

(vii) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity.

(viii) Budget estimates (i.e., estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting purposes, provided that:

(A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the activity actually performed;

(B) Significant changes in the corresponding work activity (as defined by the non-Federal entity's written policies) are identified and entered into the records in a timely manner. Short term (such as one or two months) fluctuation between workload categories need not be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term; and

(C) The non-Federal entity's system of internal controls includes processes to review after-the-fact interim charges made to a Federal award based on budget estimates. All necessary adjustment must be made such that the final amount charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated.

(ix) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for IHEs, IBS), records may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distribution of total activities.

(x) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. When recording salaries and wages charged to Federal awards for IHEs, a precise assessment of factors that contribute to costs is therefore not always feasible, nor is it expected.

(2) For records which meet the standards required in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the non-Federal entity will not be required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed, other than that referenced in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.

(3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records indicating the total number of hours worked each day.

(4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing or matching requirements on Federal awards must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from Federal awards.

(5) For states, local governments and Indian tribes, substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages to Federal awards may be used in place of or in addition to the records described in paragraph (1) if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, "rolling" time studies, case counts, or other quantifiable measures of work performed.

(i) Substitute systems which use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards including:

(A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (i)(5)(iii) of this section;

(B) The entire time period involved must be covered by the sample; and

(C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled.

(ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors, clerical and support staffs, based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable.

(iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in subsection (5)(i) may be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts to be allocated to Federal awards will be minimal, or if it concludes that the system proposed by the non-Federal entity will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which complies with the standards.

(6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on outcomes and milestones for program performance where these are clearly documented. Where approved by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, these plans are acceptable as an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

(7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a non-Federal entity may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided that such plans are approved in advance by all involved Federal awarding agencies. In these instances, the non-Federal entity must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to time charged.

(8) For a non-Federal entity where the records do not meet the standards described in this section, the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or equivalent documentation that support the records as required in this section.

####### § 200.431 Compensation - fringe benefits.

######## General.

(a)Fringe benefits are allowances and services provided by employers to their employees as compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave (vacation, family-related, sick or military), employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefit plans. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and are required by law, non-Federal entity-employee agreement, or an established policy of the non-Federal entity.

######## Leave.

(b)The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the following criteria are met:

(1) They are provided under established written leave policies;

(2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and,

(3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently followed by the non-Federal entity or specified grouping of employees.

(i) When a non-Federal entity uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment.

(ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a non-Federal entity uses the accrual basis of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded.

######## Fringe benefits.

(c)The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated in § 200.447); pension plan costs (see paragraph (i) of this section); and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies. Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.

######## Cost objectives.

(d)Fringe benefits may be assigned to cost objectives by identifying specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating on the basis of entity-wide salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made to selective groupings of employees, unless the non-Federal entity demonstrates that costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.

######## Insurance.

(e)See also § 200.447(d)(1) and (2).

(1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the liabilities for such compensation, and the types of coverage, extent of coverage, and rates and premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability.

(2) Costs of insurance on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation. The costs of such insurance when the non-Federal entity is named as beneficiary are unallowable.

######## e.g.,

(3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits (post-retirement health benefits), are allowable in the year of payment provided that the non-Federal entity follows a consistent costing policy.

######## Automobiles.

(f)That portion of automobile costs furnished by the non-Federal entity that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as fringe benefit or indirect (F&A) costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.

######## Pension plan costs.

(g)Pension plan costs which are incurred in accordance with the established policies of the non-Federal entity are allowable, provided that:

(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.

(2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory.

(3) Except for State and Local Governments, the cost assigned to each fiscal year should be determined in accordance with GAAP.

(4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable are unallowable. Non-Federal entity may elect to follow the "Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs" (48 CFR 9904.412).

(5) Pension plan termination insurance premiums paid pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable.

(6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an acceptable actuarial cost method in accordance with established written policies of the non-Federal entity.

(i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.

(ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost-based method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after the six-month period (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension of the six-month period if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the non-Federal entity's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund.

(iii) Amounts funded by the non-Federal entity in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the non-Federal entity's contribution in future periods.

(iv) When a non-Federal entity converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP.

(v) The Federal Government must receive an equitable share of any previously allowed pension costs (including earnings thereon) which revert or inure to the non-Federal entity in the form of a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.

######## Post-retirement health.

(h)Post-retirement health plans (PRHP) refers to costs of health insurance or health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) of this section for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an acceptable actuarial cost method in accordance with established written policies of the non-Federal entity.

(1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.

(2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after the six-month period (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency) are allowable in the year funded. The Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension of the six-month period if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursements and the non-Federal entity's contributions to the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in current year's PRHP costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund.

(3) Amounts funded in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the non-Federal entity contribution in a future period.

(4) When a non-Federal entity converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method and funds PRHP costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

(5) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to:

(i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums, or

(ii) An insurer or trustee to maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries.

(6) The Federal Government must receive an equitable share of any amounts of previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including earnings thereon) which revert or inure to the non-Federal entity in the form of a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.

######## Severance pay.

(i)(1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages, by non-Federal entities to workers whose employment is being terminated. Costs of severance pay are allowable only to the extent that in each case, it is required by

(i) Law;

(ii) Employer-employee agreement;

(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the non-Federal entity's part; or

(iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.

(2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows:

(i) Actual normal turnover severance payments must be allocated to all activities; or, where the non-Federal entity provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method will be acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments actually made for normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to all activities of the non-Federal entity.

(ii) Measurement of costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual will not achieve equity to both parties. Thus, accruals for this purpose are not allowable. However, the Federal Government recognizes its responsibility to participate, to the extent of its fair share, in any specific payment. Prior approval by the Federal awarding agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is required.

(3) Costs incurred in certain severance pay packages which are in an amount in excess of the normal severance pay paid by the non-Federal entity to an employee upon termination of employment and are paid to the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the non-Federal entity's assets, are unallowable.

(4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the non-Federal entity outside the United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the non-Federal entity in the United States, are unallowable, unless they are necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal awarding agency.

(5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the non-Federal entity outside the United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or curtailment of activities by, the non-Federal entity in that country, are unallowable, unless they are necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal awarding agency.

######## For IHEs only.

(j)(1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or remission of tuition for individual employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established non-Federal entity policies, and are distributed to all non-Federal entity activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable.

(2) Fringe benefits in the form of tuition or remission of tuition for individual employees not employed by IHEs are limited to the tax-free amount allowed per section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended.

(3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or tuition reductions, provided that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at other institutions according to institutional policy. See § 200.466, for treatment of tuition remission provided to students.

######## Fringe benefit programs and other benefit costs.

(k)For IHEs whose costs are paid by state or local governments, fringe benefit programs (such as pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs specifically incurred on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the non-Federal entity, are allowable costs of such non-Federal entities whether or not these costs are recorded in the accounting records of the non-Federal entities, subject to the following:

(1) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in §§ 200.402 through 200.411;

(2) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and

(3) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.

####### § 200.432 Conferences.

A conference is defined as a meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium, workshop or event whose primary purpose is the dissemination of technical information beyond the non-Federal entity and is necessary and reasonable for successful performance under the Federal award. Allowable conference costs paid by the non-Federal entity as a sponsor or host of the conference may include rental of facilities, speakers' fees, costs of meals and refreshments, local transportation, and other items incidental to such conferences unless further restricted by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. As needed, the costs of identifying, but not providing, locally available dependent-care resources are allowable. Conference hosts/sponsors must exercise discretion and judgment in ensuring that conference costs are appropriate, necessary and managed in a manner that minimizes costs to the Federal award. The Federal awarding agency may authorize exceptions where appropriate for programs including Indian tribes, children, and the elderly. See also §§ 200.438, 200.456, and 200.475.

####### § 200.433 Contingency provisions.

(a) Contingency is that part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction projects, IT systems, or other items as approved by the Federal awarding agency) which is associated with possible events or conditions arising from causes the precise outcome of which is indeterminable at the time of estimate, and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or project. Amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events may not be included.

(b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates, to the extent they are necessary to improve the precision of those estimates. Amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the Federal awarding agency. As such, contingency amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements in this part (see also §§ 200.300 and 200.403 of this part); be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records.

(c) Payments made by the Federal awarding agency to the non-Federal entity's "contingency reserve" or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in §§ 200.431 and 200.447.

####### § 200.434 Contributions and donations.

(a) Costs of contributions and donations, including cash, property, and services, from the non-Federal entity to other entities, are unallowable.

(b) The value of services and property donated to the non-Federal entity may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect (F&A) cost. The value of donated services and property may be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements (see § 200.306). Depreciation on donated assets is permitted in accordance with § 200.436, as long as the donated property is not counted towards cost sharing or matching requirements.

(c) Services donated or volunteered to the non-Federal entity may be furnished to a non-Federal entity by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services may be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 200.306.

(d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the non-Federal entity will be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services.

(e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to the nonprofit organization utilized in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the non-Federal entity's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist:

(1) The aggregate value of the services is material;

(2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the non-Federal entity;

(i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services rendered, the non-Federal entity and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services.

(ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the total costs of the project. Such indirect costs may be reimbursed under the Federal award or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements.

(f) Fair market value of donated services must be computed as described in § 200.306.

(g) Personal Property and Use of Space.

(1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a non-Federal entity. The value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost.

(2) The value of the donations may be used to meet cost sharing or matching share requirements under the conditions described in § 200.300 of this part. The value of the donations must be determined in accordance with § 200.300. Where donations are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement will not be made.

During the pendency of any proceeding covered by paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, the Federal Government must generally withhold payment of such costs. However, if in its best interests, the Federal Government may provide for conditional payment upon provision of adequate security, or other adequate assurance, and agreement to repay all unallowable costs, plus interest, if the costs are subsequently determined to be unallowable.

####### § 200.436 Depreciation.

(a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. The non-Federal entity may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP, provided that they are used, needed in the non-Federal entity's activities, and properly allocated to Federal awards. Such compensation must be made by computing depreciation.

(b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with Appendices III through IX.

(c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the non-Federal entity by a third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as matching but not both. For the computation of depreciation, the acquisition cost will exclude:

(1) The cost of land;

(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it is presently located;

(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the non-Federal entity that are already claimed as matching or where law or agreement prohibits recovery;

(4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award; and

(d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed:

(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factors as type of construction, nature of the equipment, technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.

(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be presumed to be the appropriate method. Depreciation methods once used may not be changed unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency. The depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect (F&A) rate purposes must be the same methods used by the non-Federal entity for its financial statements.

(3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each component item may then be depreciated over its estimated useful life. The building components must be grouped into three general components of a building: building shell (including construction and design costs), building services systems (e.g., elevators, HVAC, plumbing system and heating and air-conditioning system) and fixed equipment (e.g., sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms and glassware/washers). In exceptional cases, a cognizant agency may authorize a non-Federal entity to use more than these three groupings. When a non-Federal entity elects to depreciate its buildings by its components, the same depreciation methods must be used for indirect (F&A) purposes and financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

(4) No depreciation may be allowed on any assets that have outlived their depreciable lives.

(5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (i.e., from the date the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation applicable to periods prior to the conversion from the use allowance method as well as depreciation after the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset.

(e) Charges for depreciation must be supported by adequate property records, and physical inventories must be taken at least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. Statistical sampling techniques may be used in taking these inventories. In addition, adequate depreciation records showing the amount of depreciation must be maintained.

####### § 200.437 Employee health and welfare costs.

(a) Costs incurred in accordance with the non-Federal entity's documented policies for the improvement of working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee health, and employee performance are allowable.

(b) Such costs will be equitably apportioned to all activities of the non-Federal entity. Income generated from any of these activities will be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.

(c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the non-Federal entity's objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating objectives other than the above are allowable only:

(1) Where the non-Federal entity can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and

(2) With the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

####### § 200.438 Entertainment costs.

Costs of entertainment, including amusement, diversion, and social activities and any associated costs are unallowable, except where specific costs that might otherwise be considered entertainment have a programmatic purpose and are authorized either in the approved budget for the Federal award or with prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures.

######## capital expenditures, equipment, special purpose equipment, general purpose equipment, acquisition cost,,capital assets.

(a) See § 200.1 for the definitions ofand

(b) The following rules of allowability must apply to equipment and other capital expenditures:

(1) Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land are unallowable as direct charges, except with the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(2) Capital expenditures for special purpose equipment are allowable as direct costs, provided that items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more have the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment which materially increase their value or useful life are unallowable as a direct cost except with the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency, or pass-through entity. See § 200.436, for rules on the allowability of depreciation on buildings, capital improvements, and equipment. See also § 200.465.

(4) When approved as a direct charge pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, capital expenditures will be charged in the period in which the expenditure is incurred, or as otherwise determined appropriate and negotiated with the Federal awarding agency.

(5) The unamortized portion of any equipment written off as a result of a change in capitalization levels may be recovered by continuing to claim the otherwise allowable depreciation on the equipment, or by amortizing the amount to be written off over a period of years negotiated with the Federal cognizant agency for indirect cost.

(6) Cost of equipment disposal. If the non-Federal entity is instructed by the Federal awarding agency to otherwise dispose of or transfer the equipment the costs of such disposal or transfer are allowable.

(7) Equipment and other capital expenditures are unallowable as indirect costs. See § 200.436.

####### § 200.440 Exchange rates.

(a) Cost increases for fluctuations in exchange rates are allowable costs subject to the availability of funding. Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of the project. The Federal awarding agency must however ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

(b) The non-Federal entity is required to make reviews of local currency gains to determine the need for additional federal funding before the expiration date of the Federal award. Subsequent adjustments for currency increases may be allowable only when the non-Federal entity provides the Federal awarding agency with adequate source documentation from a commonly used source in effect at the time the expense was made, and to the extent that sufficient Federal funds are available.

####### § 200.441 Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements.

Costs resulting from non-Federal entity violations of, alleged violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, state, tribal, local or foreign laws and regulations are unallowable, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific provisions of the Federal award, or with prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency. See also § 200.435.

####### § 200.442 Fund raising and investment management costs.

(a) Costs of organized fund raising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and similar expenses incurred to raise capital or obtain contributions are unallowable. Fund raising costs for the purposes of meeting the Federal program objectives are allowable with prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency. Proposal costs are covered in § 200.460.

(b) Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses incurred to enhance income from investments are unallowable except when associated with investments covering pension, self-insurance, or other funds which include Federal participation allowed by this part.

(c) Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and securities are allowable.

(d) Both allowable and unallowable fund-raising and investment activities must be allocated as an appropriate share of indirect costs under the conditions described in § 200.413.

####### § 200.443 Gains and losses on disposition of depreciable assets.

(a) Gains and losses on the sale, retirement, or other disposition of depreciable property must be included in the year in which they occur as credits or charges to the asset cost grouping(s) in which the property was included. The amount of the gain or loss to be included as a credit or charge to the appropriate asset cost grouping(s) is the difference between the amount realized on the property and the undepreciated basis of the property.

(b) Gains and losses from the disposition of depreciable property must not be recognized as a separate credit or charge under the following conditions:

(1) The gain or loss is processed through a depreciation account and is reflected in the depreciation allowable under §§ 200.436 and 200.439.

(2) The property is given in exchange as part of the purchase price of a similar item and the gain or loss is taken into account in determining the depreciation cost basis of the new item.

(3) A loss results from the failure to maintain permissible insurance, except as otherwise provided in § 200.447.

(4) Compensation for the use of the property was provided through use allowances in lieu of depreciation.

(5) Gains and losses arising from mass or extraordinary sales, retirements, or other dispositions must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

(c) Gains or losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of property other than the property covered in paragraph (a) of this section, e.g., land, must be excluded in computing Federal award costs.

(d) When assets acquired with Federal funds, in part or wholly, are disposed of, the distribution of the proceeds must be made in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316 of this part.

####### § 200.444 General costs of government.

(a) For states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the general costs of government are unallowable (except as provided in § 200.475). Unallowable costs include:

(1) Salaries and expenses of the Office of the Governor of a state or the chief executive of a local government or the chief executive of an Indian tribe;

(2) Salaries and other expenses of a state legislature, tribal council, or similar local governmental body, such as a county supervisor, city council, school board, etc., whether incurred for purposes of legislation or executive direction;

(3) Costs of the judicial branch of a government;

(4) Costs of prosecutorial activities unless treated as a direct cost to a specific program if authorized by statute or regulation (however, this does not preclude the allowability of other legal activities of the Attorney General as described in § 200.435); and

(5) Costs of other general types of government services normally provided to the general public, such as fire and police, unless provided for as a direct cost under a program statute or regulation.

######## Local government

(b) For Indian tribes and Councils of Governments (COGs) (see definition forin § 200.1 of this part), up to 50% of salaries and expenses directly attributable to managing and operating Federal programs by the chief executive and his or her staff can be included in the indirect cost calculation without documentation.

####### § 200.445 Goods or services for personal use.

(a) Costs of goods or services for personal use of the non-Federal entity's employees are unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.

(b) Costs of housing (e.g., depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances and personal living expenses are only allowable as direct costs regardless of whether reported as taxable income to the employees. In addition, to be allowable direct costs must be approved in advance by a Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.446 Idle facilities and idle capacity.

(a) As used in this section the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section:

(1) Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof, equipment individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the non-Federal entity.

(2) Idle facilities means completely unused facilities that are excess to the non-Federal entity's current needs.

(3) Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between:

(i) That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays and;

(ii) The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multi-shift basis should be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage would normally be expected for the type of facility involved.

(4) Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs, e.g., insurance, interest, and depreciation. These costs could include the costs of idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or information technology system capacity that is built to withstand major fluctuations in load, e.g., consolidated data centers.

(b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that:

(1) They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate and are allocated appropriately to all benefiting programs; or

(2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. Under the exception stated in this subsection, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period of time, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of such facilities.

(c) The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost rates from period to period. Such costs are allowable, provided that the capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Federal award or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards, subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economic, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be considered idle facilities.

####### § 200.447 Insurance and indemnification.

(a) Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained, pursuant to the Federal award, are allowable.

(b) Costs of other insurance in connection with the general conduct of activities are allowable subject to the following limitations:

(1) Types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the non-Federal entity's policy and sound business practice.

(2) Costs of insurance or of contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal Government property are unallowable except to the extent that the Federal awarding agency has specifically required or approved such costs.

(3) Costs allowed for business interruption or other similar insurance must exclude coverage of management fees.

(4) Costs of insurance on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibilities are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation (see § 200.431). The cost of such insurance when the non-Federal entity is identified as the beneficiary is unallowable.

(5) Insurance against defects. Costs of insurance with respect to any costs incurred to correct defects in the non-Federal entity's materials or workmanship are unallowable.

(6) Medical liability (malpractice) insurance. Medical liability insurance is an allowable cost of Federal research programs only to the extent that the Federal research programs involve human subjects or training of participants in research techniques. Medical liability insurance costs must be treated as a direct cost and must be assigned to individual projects based on the manner in which the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance.

(c) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through a self-insurance program or otherwise) are unallowable, unless expressly provided for in the Federal award. However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, breakage, and disappearance of small hand tools, which occur in the ordinary course of operations, are allowable.

(d) Contributions to a reserve for certain self-insurance programs including workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, and severance pay are allowable subject to the following provisions:

(1) The type of coverage and the extent of coverage and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had insurance (including reinsurance) been purchased to cover the risks. However, provision for known or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate used for discounting the liability must be determined by giving consideration to such factors as the non-Federal entity's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return.

(2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves.

(3)(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, etc. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages will normally be limited to the value of claims:

(A) Submitted and adjudicated but not paid;

(B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and

(C) Incurred but not submitted.

(ii) Reserve levels in excess of the amounts based on the above must be identified and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal.

(4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any significant differences due to types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured activities or agencies of the non-Federal entity. If individual departments or agencies of the non-Federal entity experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those differences are to be recognized by the use of separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an equitable allocation.

(5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (e.g., general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect cost, claims collection regulations.

(e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received.

(f) Indemnification includes securing the non-Federal entity against liabilities to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal Government is obligated to indemnify the non-Federal entity only to the extent expressly provided for in the Federal award, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

####### § 200.448 Intellectual property.

######## Patent costs.

(a)(1) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are allowable:

(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents required by the Federal award, and of searching the art to the extent necessary to make such disclosures;

(ii) Costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs in connection with the filing and prosecution of a United States patent application where title or royalty-free license is required by the Federal Government to be conveyed to the Federal Government; and

(iii) General counseling services relating to patent and copyright matters, such as advice on patent and copyright laws, regulations, clauses, and employee intellectual property agreements (See also § 200.459).

(2) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are unallowable:

(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents, and of searching the art to make disclosures not required by the Federal award;

(ii) Costs in connection with filing and prosecuting any foreign patent application, or any United States patent application, where the Federal award does not require conveying title or a royalty-free license to the Federal Government.

######## Royalties and other costs for use of patents and copyrights.

(b)(1) Royalties on a patent or copyright or amortization of the cost of acquiring by purchase a copyright, patent, or rights thereto, necessary for the proper performance of the Federal award are allowable unless:

(i) The Federal Government already has a license or the right to free use of the patent or copyright.

(ii) The patent or copyright has been adjudicated to be invalid, or has been administratively determined to be invalid.

(iii) The patent or copyright is considered to be unenforceable.

(iv) The patent or copyright is expired.

(2) Special care should be exercised in determining reasonableness where the royalties may have been arrived at as a result of less-than-arm's-length bargaining, such as:

(i) Royalties paid to persons, including corporations, affiliated with the non-Federal entity.

(ii) Royalties paid to unaffiliated parties, including corporations, under an agreement entered into in contemplation that a Federal award would be made.

(iii) Royalties paid under an agreement entered into after a Federal award is made to a non-Federal entity.

(3) In any case involving a patent or copyright formerly owned by the non-Federal entity, the amount of royalty allowed must not exceed the cost which would have been allowed had the non-Federal entity retained title thereto.

####### § 200.449 Interest.

######## General.

(a)Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of the non-Federal entity's own funds, however represented, are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the conditions in this section.

######## Capital assets.

(b)(1) Capital assets is defined as noted in § 200.1 of this part. An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP.

(2) For non-Federal entity fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets include patents and computer software. For software development projects, only interest attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable.

######## Conditions for all non-Federal entities.

(c)(1) The non-Federal entity uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards;

(2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value available to the non-Federal entity from an unrelated (arm's length) third party.

(3) The non-Federal entity obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (that is, a transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate available via such a transaction.

(4) The non-Federal entity limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least expensive alternative. For example, a lease contract that transfers ownership by the end of the contract may be determined less costly than purchasing through other types of debt financing, in which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been used.

(5) The non-Federal entity expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with GAAP.

(6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under arbitrage requirements are excludable.

(7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct facilities, unless the non-Federal entity makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 25 percent or more. For this purpose, "initial equity contribution" means the amount or value of contributions made by the non-Federal entity for the acquisition of facilities prior to occupancy.

(i) The non-Federal entity must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of the facility used for Federal awards.

(ii) The non-Federal entity must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows:

(A) Annually, the non-Federal entity must prepare a cumulative (from the inception of the project) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the cost of land), and interest payments.

(B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the non-Federal entity must divide the annual amounts determined in step (i) by the number of months in the year (usually 12) that the building is in service.

(C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to allowable interest cost. The rate of interest to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill closing rate as of the last business day of that month.

(8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable.

(d) Additional conditions for states, local governments and Indian tribes. For costs to be allowable, the non-Federal entity must have incurred the interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or for land and equipment after September 1, 1995.

(1) The requirement to offset interest earned on borrowed funds against current allowable interest cost (paragraph (c)(5), above) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds.

(2) The non-Federal entity will negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as outlined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, a non-Federal entity must consider only cash inflows and outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards.

(e) Additional conditions for IHEs. For costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.

(f) Additional condition for nonprofit organizations. For costs to be allowable, the nonprofit organization incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.

(g) The interest allowability provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to "full coverage" under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at 48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The non-Federal entity's Federal awards are instead subject to CAS 414 (48 CFR 9904.414), "Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital", and CAS 417 (48 CFR 9904.417), "Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction".

####### § 200.450 Lobbying.

(a) The cost of certain influencing activities associated with obtaining grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements, or loans is an unallowable cost. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and loans is governed by relevant statutes, including among others, the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, "New Restrictions on Lobbying" published on February 26, 1990, including definitions, and the Office of Management and Budget "Governmentwide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying" and notices published on December 20, 1989, June 15, 1990, January 15, 1992, and January 19, 1996.

######## Executive lobbying costs.

(b)Costs incurred in attempting to improperly influence either directly or indirectly, an employee or officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter on any basis other than the merits of the matter.

(c) In addition to the above, the following restrictions are applicable to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:

(1) Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:

(i) Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, state, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure, through in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar activity;

(ii) Establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the expenses of a political party, campaign, political action committee, or other organization established for the purpose of influencing the outcomes of elections in the United States;

(iii) Any attempt to influence:

(A) The introduction of Federal or state legislation;

(B) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or state legislature (including efforts to influence state or local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);

(C) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda, or by urging members of the general public, or any segment thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration, march, rally, fund raising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or telephone campaign; or

(D) Any government official or employee in connection with a decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;

(iv) Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.

(2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

(i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a state legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof), in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the non-Federal entity's member of congress, legislative body or a subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings;

(ii) Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to influence state legislation in order to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the non-Federal entity's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement; or

(iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal award.

(iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of "lobbying" or "influencing legislation" by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct and "grass roots" lobbying activities in order to retain their charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, I.R.C. §§ 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:

(A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;

(B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and

(C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as defined by I.R.C. § 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1)-(c)(3).

(v) When a non-Federal entity seeks reimbursement for indirect (F&A) costs, total lobbying costs must be separately identified in the indirect (F&A) cost rate proposal, and thereafter treated as other unallowable activity costs in accordance with the procedures of § 200.413.

(vi) The non-Federal entity must submit as part of its annual indirect (F&A) cost rate proposal a certification that the requirements and standards of this section have been complied with. (See also § 200.415.)

(vii)(A) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of complying with the record keeping requirements in § 200.302 with respect to lobbying costs during any particular calendar month when:

######## 1

() The employee engages in lobbying (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section) 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and

######## 2

() Within the preceding five-year period, the non-Federal entity has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying costs.

######## 1,2,1,2

(B) When conditions in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(A)() and () of this section are met, non-Federal entities are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii)(A)() and () of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time spent by employees during a calendar month.

(viii) The Federal awarding agency must establish procedures for resolving in advance, in consultation with OMB, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or non-Federal entity from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.

####### § 200.451 Losses on other awards or contracts.

Any excess of costs over income under any other award or contract of any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the non-Federal entity's contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing agreements or any under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for indirect (F&A) costs. Also, any excess of costs over authorized funding levels transferred from any award or contract to another award or contract is unallowable. All losses are not allowable indirect (F&A) costs and are required to be included in the appropriate indirect cost rate base for allocation of indirect costs.

####### § 200.452 Maintenance and repair costs.

Costs incurred for utilities, insurance, security, necessary maintenance, janitorial services, repair, or upkeep of buildings and equipment (including Federal property unless otherwise provided for) which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable. Costs incurred for improvements which add to the permanent value of the buildings and equipment or appreciably prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see § 200.439). These costs are only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other agreements.

####### § 200.453 Materials and supplies costs, including costs of computing devices.

(a) Costs incurred for materials, supplies, and fabricated parts necessary to carry out a Federal award are allowable.

(b) Purchased materials and supplies must be charged at their actual prices, net of applicable credits. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms must be charged at their actual net cost under any recognized method of pricing inventory withdrawals, consistently applied. Incoming transportation charges are a proper part of materials and supplies costs.

(c) Materials and supplies used for the performance of a Federal award may be charged as direct costs. In the specific case of computing devices, charging as direct costs is allowable for devices that are essential and allocable, but not solely dedicated, to the performance of a Federal award.

(d) Where federally-donated or furnished materials are used in performing the Federal award, such materials will be used without charge.

####### § 200.454 Memberships, subscriptions, and professional activity costs.

(a) Costs of the non-Federal entity's membership in business, technical, and professional organizations are allowable.

(b) Costs of the non-Federal entity's subscriptions to business, professional, and technical periodicals are allowable.

(c) Costs of membership in any civic or community organization are allowable with prior approval by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(d) Costs of membership in any country club or social or dining club or organization are unallowable.

(e) Costs of membership in organizations whose primary purpose is lobbying are unallowable. See also § 200.450.

####### § 200.455 Organization costs.

Costs such as incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters, organizers or management consultants, attorneys, accountants, or investment counselor, whether or not employees of the non-Federal entity in connection with establishment or reorganization of an organization, are unallowable except with prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.456 Participant support costs.

Participant support costs as defined in § 200.1 are allowable with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.457 Plant and security costs.

Necessary and reasonable expenses incurred for protection and security of facilities, personnel, and work products are allowable. Such costs include, but are not limited to, wages and uniforms of personnel engaged in security activities; equipment; barriers; protective (non-military) gear, devices, and equipment; contractual security services; and consultants. Capital expenditures for plant security purposes are subject to § 200.439.

####### § 200.458 Pre-award costs.

Pre-award costs are those incurred prior to the effective date of the Federal award or subaward directly pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award where such costs are necessary for efficient and timely performance of the scope of work. Such costs are allowable only to the extent that they would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the Federal award and only with the written approval of the Federal awarding agency. If charged to the award, these costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the award, unless otherwise specified by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

####### § 200.459 Professional service costs.

(a) Costs of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill, and who are not officers or employees of the non-Federal entity, are allowable, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Federal Government. In addition, legal and related services are limited under § 200.435.

(b) In determining the allowability of costs in a particular case, no single factor or any special combination of factors is necessarily determinative. However, the following factors are relevant:

(1) The nature and scope of the service rendered in relation to the service required.

(2) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the non-Federal entity's capability in the particular area.

(3) The past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to Federal awards.

(4) The impact of Federal awards on the non-Federal entity's business (i.e., what new problems have arisen).

(5) Whether the proportion of Federal work to the non-Federal entity's total business is such as to influence the non-Federal entity in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Federal awards.

(6) Whether the service can be performed more economically by direct employment rather than contracting.

(7) The qualifications of the individual or concern rendering the service and the customary fees charged, especially on non-federally funded activities.

(8) Adequacy of the contractual agreement for the service (e.g., description of the service, estimate of time required, rate of compensation, and termination provisions).

(c) In addition to the factors in paragraph (b) of this section, to be allowable, retainer fees must be supported by evidence of bona fide services available or rendered.

####### § 200.460 Proposal costs.

Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, proposals, or applications on potential Federal and non-Federal awards or projects, including the development of data necessary to support the non-Federal entity's bids or proposals. Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect (F&A) costs and allocated currently to all activities of the non-Federal entity. No proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable to the current period.

####### § 200.461 Publication and printing costs.

(a) Publication costs for electronic and print media, including distribution, promotion, and general handling are allowable. If these costs are not identifiable with a particular cost objective, they should be allocated as indirect costs to all benefiting activities of the non-Federal entity.

(b) Page charges for professional journal publications are allowable where:

(1) The publications report work supported by the Federal Government; and

(2) The charges are levied impartially on all items published by the journal, whether or not under a Federal award.

(3) The non-Federal entity may charge the Federal award during closeout for the costs of publication or sharing of research results if the costs are not incurred during the period of performance of the Federal award. If charged to the award, these costs must be charged to the final budget period of the award, unless otherwise specified by the Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.462 Rearrangement and reconversion costs.

(a) Costs incurred for ordinary and normal rearrangement and alteration of facilities are allowable as indirect costs. Special arrangements and alterations costs incurred specifically for a Federal award are allowable as a direct cost with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.

(b) Costs incurred in the restoration or rehabilitation of the non-Federal entity's facilities to approximately the same condition existing immediately prior to commencement of Federal awards, less costs related to normal wear and tear, are allowable.

####### § 200.463 Recruiting costs.

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and provided that the size of the staff recruited and maintained is in keeping with workload requirements, costs of "help wanted" advertising, operating costs of an employment office necessary to secure and maintain an adequate staff, costs of operating an aptitude and educational testing program, travel costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel, travel costs of applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of new employees, are allowable to the extent that such costs are incurred pursuant to the non-Federal entity's standard recruitment program. Where the non-Federal entity uses employment agencies, costs not in excess of standard commercial rates for such services are allowable.

(b) Special emoluments, fringe benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional personnel that do not meet the test of reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the non-Federal entity, are unallowable.

(c) Where relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part to a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the non-Federal entity will be required to refund or credit the Federal share of such relocation costs to the Federal Government. See also § 200.464.

(d) Short-term, travel visa costs (as opposed to longer-term, immigration visas) are generally allowable expenses that may be proposed as a direct cost. Since short-term visas are issued for a specific period and purpose, they can be clearly identified as directly connected to work performed on a Federal award. For these costs to be directly charged to a Federal award, they must:

(1) Be critical and necessary for the conduct of the project;

(2) Be allowable under the applicable cost principles;

(3) Be consistent with the non-Federal entity's cost accounting practices and non-Federal entity policy; and

(4) Meet the definition of "direct cost" as described in the applicable cost principles.

####### § 200.464 Relocation costs of employees.

(a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or for a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:

(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.

(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.

(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.

(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:

(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of his or her immediate family and his household, and personal effects to the new location.

(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to maximum period of 30 calendar days.

(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incident to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in (4), are limited to 8 per cent of the sales price of the employee's former home.

(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.

(5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as the costs of canceling an unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the monthly rental.

(c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. When relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of new employees have been charged to a Federal award and the employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the non-Federal entity must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of the cost. If dependents are not permitted at the location for any reason and the costs do not include costs of transporting household goods, the costs of travel to an overseas location must be considered travel costs in accordance with § 200.474 Travel costs, and not this relocations costs of employees (See also § 200.464).

(d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable:

(1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home.

(2) A loss on the sale of a former home.

(3) Continuing mortgage principal and interest payments on a home being sold.

(4) Income taxes paid by an employee related to reimbursed relocation costs.

####### § 200.465 Rental costs of real property and equipment.

(a) Subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as: rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed and other options are available.

(b) Rental costs under "sale and lease back" arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would be allowed had the non-Federal entity continued to own the property. This amount would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.

(c) Rental costs under "less-than-arm's-length" leases are allowable only up to the amount (as explained in paragraph (b) of this section). For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party to the lease agreement is able to control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to those between:

(1) Divisions of the non-Federal entity;

(2) The non-Federal entity under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and

(3) The non-Federal entity and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the non-Federal entity or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the non-Federal entity may establish a separate corporation for the sole purpose of owning property and leasing it back to the non-Federal entity.

(4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party:

(i) Spouse, and parents thereof;

(ii) Children, and spouses thereof;

(iii) Parents, and spouses thereof;

(iv) Siblings, and spouses thereof;

(v) Grandparents and grandchildren, and spouses thereof;

(vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 through 5 of this definition; and

(vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

(5) Rental costs under leases which are required to be treated as capital leases under GAAP are allowable only up to the amount (as explained in paragraph (b) of this section) that would be allowed had the non-Federal entity purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. The provisions of GAAP must be used to determine whether a lease is a capital lease. Interest costs related to capital leases are allowable to the extent they meet the criteria in § 200.449 Interest. Unallowable costs include amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes that would not have been incurred had the non-Federal entity purchased the property.

(6) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the non-Federal entity, to include commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office workspace is unallowable.

(d) Rental costs under leases which are required to be accounted for as a financed purchase under GASB standards or a finance lease under FASB standards under GAAP are allowable only up to the amount (as explained in paragraph (b) of this section) that would be allowed had the non-Federal entity purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. Interest costs related to these leases are allowable to the extent they meet the criteria in § 200.449. Unallowable costs include amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes that would not have been incurred had the non-Federal entity purchased the property.

(e) Rental or lease payments are allowable under lease contracts where the non-Federal entity is required to recognize an intangible right-to-use lease asset (per GASB) or right of use operating lease asset (per FASB) for purposes of financial reporting in accordance with GAAP.

(f) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the non-Federal entity, to include commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office workspace is unallowable.

####### § 200.466 Scholarships and student aid costs.

(a) Costs of scholarships, fellowships, and other programs of student aid at IHEs are allowable only when the purpose of the Federal award is to provide training to selected participants and the charge is approved by the Federal awarding agency. However, tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or in lieu of, wages to students performing necessary work are allowable provided that:

(1) The individual is conducting activities necessary to the Federal award;

(2) Tuition remission and other support are provided in accordance with established policy of the IHE and consistently provided in a like manner to students in return for similar activities conducted under Federal awards as well as other activities; and

(3) During the academic period, the student is enrolled in an advanced degree program at a non-Federal entity or affiliated institution and the activities of the student in relation to the Federal award are related to the degree program;

(4) The tuition or other payments are reasonable compensation for the work performed and are conditioned explicitly upon the performance of necessary work; and

(5) It is the IHE's practice to similarly compensate students under Federal awards as well as other activities.

(b) Charges for tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid to students as, or in lieu of, salaries and wages must be subject to the reporting requirements in § 200.430, and must be treated as direct or indirect cost in accordance with the actual work being performed. Tuition remission may be charged on an average rate basis. See also § 200.431.

####### § 200.467 Selling and marketing costs.

Costs of selling and marketing any products or services of the non-Federal entity (unless allowed under § 200.421) are unallowable, except as direct costs, with prior approval by the Federal awarding agency when necessary for the performance of the Federal award.

####### § 200.468 Specialized service facilities.

(a) The costs of services provided by highly complex or specialized facilities operated by the non-Federal entity, such as computing facilities, wind tunnels, and reactors are allowable, provided the charges for the services meet the conditions of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and, in addition, take into account any items of income or Federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under § 200.406.

(b) The costs of such services, when material, must be charged directly to applicable awards based on actual usage of the services on the basis of a schedule of rates or established methodology that:

(1) Does not discriminate between activities under Federal awards and other activities of the non-Federal entity, including usage by the non-Federal entity for internal purposes, and

(2) Is designed to recover only the aggregate costs of the services. The costs of each service must consist normally of both its direct costs and its allocable share of all indirect (F&A) costs. Rates must be adjusted at least biennially, and must take into consideration over/under-applied costs of the previous period(s).

(c) Where the costs incurred for a service are not material, they may be allocated as indirect (F&A) costs.

(d) Under some extraordinary circumstances, where it is in the best interest of the Federal Government and the non-Federal entity to establish alternative costing arrangements, such arrangements may be worked out with the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs.

####### § 200.469 Student activity costs.

Costs incurred for intramural activities, student publications, student clubs, and other student activities, are unallowable, unless specifically provided for in the Federal award.

####### § 200.470 Taxes (including Value Added Tax).

(a) For states, local governments and Indian tribes:

(1) Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are allowable, except for self-assessed taxes that disproportionately affect Federal programs or changes in tax policies that disproportionately affect Federal programs.

(2) Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are in effect user fees for benefits provided to the Federal Government are allowable.

(3) This provision does not restrict the authority of the Federal awarding agency to identify taxes where Federal participation is inappropriate. Where the identification of the amount of unallowable taxes would require an inordinate amount of effort, the cognizant agency for indirect costs may accept a reasonable approximation thereof.

(b) For nonprofit organizations and IHEs:

(1) In general, taxes which the non-Federal entity is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP, and payments made to local governments in lieu of taxes which are commensurate with the local government services received are allowable, except for:

(i) Taxes from which exemptions are available to the non-Federal entity directly or which are available to the non-Federal entity based on an exemption afforded the Federal Government and, in the latter case, when the Federal awarding agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates,

(ii) Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, and

(iii) Federal income taxes.

(2) Any refund of taxes, and any payment to the non-Federal entity of interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, will be credited either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate, to the Federal Government. However, any interest actually paid or credited to an non-Federal entity incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the non-Federal entity has been reimbursed by the Federal Government for the taxes, interest, and penalties.

(c) Value Added Tax (VAT) Foreign taxes charged for the purchase of goods or services that a non-Federal entity is legally required to pay in country is an allowable expense under Federal awards. Foreign tax refunds or applicable credits under Federal awards refer to receipts, or reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. To the extent that such credits accrued or received by the non-Federal entity relate to allowable cost, these costs must be credited to the Federal awarding agency either as costs or cash refunds. If the costs are credited back to the Federal award, the non-Federal entity may reduce the Federal share of costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, use the foreign government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award with prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

####### § 200.471 Telecommunication costs and video surveillance costs.

(a) Costs incurred for telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment such as phones, internet, video surveillance, cloud servers are allowable except for the following circumstances:

(b) Obligating or expending covered telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment or services as described in § 200.216 to:

(1) Procure or obtain, extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain;

(2) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure; or

(3) Obtain the equipment, services, or systems.

####### § 200.472 Termination costs.

Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs, or the need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They are to be used in conjunction with the other provisions of this part in termination situations.

(a) The cost of items reasonably usable on the non-Federal entity's other work must not be allowable unless the non-Federal entity submits evidence that it would not retain such items at cost without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the non-Federal entity, the Federal awarding agency should consider the non-Federal entity's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the non-Federal entity must be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on the non-Federal entity's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.

(b) If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the non-Federal entity, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately after the effective date of termination, such costs are generally allowable within the limitations set forth in this part, except that any such costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the non-Federal entity to discontinue such costs must be unallowable.

(c) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if:

(1) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the non-Federal entity,

(2) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the Federal awarding agency (see also § 200.313 (d)), and

(3) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to that portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired.

(d) Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award less the residual value of such leases, if:

(1) The amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and such further period as may be reasonable, and

(2) The non-Federal entity makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of such lease. There also may be included the cost of alterations of such leased property, provided such alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award, and of reasonable restoration required by the provisions of the lease.

(e) Settlement expenses including the following are generally allowable:

(1) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably necessary for:

(i) The preparation and presentation to the Federal awarding agency of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see subpart D, including §§ 200.339-200.343); and

(ii) The termination and settlement of subawards.

(2) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award.

(f) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims which are common to the Federal award and to other work of the non-Federal entity, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the non-Federal entity's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with contractors and/or subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is otherwise consistent with the basic guidelines contained in § 200.414. The indirect costs so allocated must exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.

####### § 200.473 Training and education costs.

The cost of training and education provided for employee development is allowable.

####### § 200.474 Transportation costs.

Costs incurred for freight, express, cartage, postage, and other transportation services relating either to goods purchased, in process, or delivered, are allowable. When such costs can readily be identified with the items involved, they may be charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. Where identification with the materials received cannot readily be made, inbound transportation cost may be charged to the appropriate indirect (F&A) cost accounts if the non-Federal entity follows a consistent, equitable procedure in this respect. Outbound freight, if reimbursable under the terms and conditions of the Federal award, should be treated as a direct cost.

####### § 200.475 Travel costs.

######## General.

(a)Travel costs are the expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the non-Federal entity. Such costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs incurred, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip, and results in charges consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the non-Federal entity's non-federally-funded activities and in accordance with non-Federal entity's written travel reimbursement policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 200.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity when they are specifically related to the Federal award.

######## Lodging and subsistence.

(b)Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the non-Federal entity in its regular operations as the result of the non-Federal entity's written travel policy. In addition, if these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that:

(1) Participation of the individual is necessary to the Federal award; and

(2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with non-Federal entity's established travel policy.

(c)(1) Temporary dependent care costs (as dependent is defined in 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular dependent care that directly results from travel to conferences is allowable provided that:

(i) The costs are a direct result of the individual's travel for the Federal award;

(ii) The costs are consistent with the non-Federal entity's documented travel policy for all entity travel; and

(iii) Are only temporary during the travel period.

(2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of duration of six months or more with prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. See also § 200.432.

(d) In the absence of an acceptable, written non-Federal entity policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11, ("Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances"), or by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or his or her designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)).

######## Commercial air travel.

(e)(1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would:

(i) Require circuitous routing;

(ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours;

(iii) Excessively prolong travel;

(iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or

(v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The non-Federal entity must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis in order for the use of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases.

(2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a non-Federal entity's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare is unavailable for specific trips if the non-Federal entity can demonstrate that such airfare was not available in the specific case.

######## Air travel by other than commercial carrier.

(f)Costs of travel by non-Federal entity-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft include the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of such costs that exceeds the cost of airfare as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, is unallowable.

####### § 200.476 Trustees.

Travel and subsistence costs of trustees (or directors) at IHEs and nonprofit organizations are allowable. See also § 200.475.

##### Subpart F - Audit Requirements

###### General

####### § 200.500 Purpose.

This part sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards.

###### Audits

####### § 200.501 Audit requirements.

######## Audit required.

(a)A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.

######## Single audit.

(b)A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 200.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

######## Program-specific audit election.

(c)When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&D) and the Federal program's statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with § 200.507. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.

######## Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000.

(d)A non-Federal entity that expends less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 200.503, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).

######## Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).

(e)Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.

######## Subrecipients and contractors.

(f)An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. Section § 200.331 sets forth the considerations in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.

######## Compliance responsibility for contractors.

(g)In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

######## For-profit subrecipient.

(h)Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits. See also § 200.332.

####### § 200.502 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.

######## Determining Federal awards expended.

(a)The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.

######## Loan and loan guarantees (loans).

(b)Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:

(1) Value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus

(2) Beginning of the audit period balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus

(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.

######## Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at IHEs.

(c)When loans are made to students of an IHE but the IHE does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period must be considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.

######## Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).

(d)Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.

######## Endowment funds.

(e)The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.

######## Free rent.

(f)Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.

######## Valuing non-cash assistance.

(g)Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.

######## Medicare.

(h)Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.

######## Medicaid.

(i)Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a state requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.

######## Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration.

(j)For purposes of this part, loans made from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility that are funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended.

####### § 200.503 Relation to other audit requirements.

(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and use that information.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal agency, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency must plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed, by other auditors.

(c) The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official. For example, requirements that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies.

######## Federal agency to pay for additional audits.

(d)A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.

######## Request for a program to be audited as a major program.

(e)A Federal awarding agency may request that an auditee have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal awarding agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such a request by informing the Federal awarding agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in § 200.518 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal awarding agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal awarding agency request, and the Federal awarding agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.

####### § 200.504 Frequency of audits.

Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part must be performed annually. Any biennial audit must cover both years within the biennial period.

(a) A state, local government, or Indian tribe that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period.

(b) Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.

####### § 200.505 Sanctions.

In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in § 200.339.

####### § 200.506 Audit costs.

See § 200.425.

####### § 200.507 Program-specific audits.

######## Program-specific audit guide available.

(a)In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal controls, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found in the compliance supplement, Part 8, Appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides, which includes a website where a copy of the guide can be obtained. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.

######## Program-specific audit guide not available.

(b)(1) When a current program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.

(2) The auditee must prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of § 200.511(c).

(3) The auditor must:

(i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS;

(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the Federal program consistent with the requirements of § 200.514(c) for a major program;

(iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements of § 200.514(d) for a major program;

(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding; and

(v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 200.516.

(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

(i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;

(ii) A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which must describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;

(iii) A report on compliance which includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and

(iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with § 200.515(d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of § 200.515(d)(3).

######## Report submission for program-specific audits.

(c)(1) The audit must be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make report copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

(2) When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee must electronically submit to the FAC the data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide.

(3) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the reporting package for a program-specific audit must consist of the financial statement(s) of the Federal program, a summary schedule of prior audit findings, and a corrective action plan as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the auditor's report(s) described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The data collection form prepared in accordance with § 200.512(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and one copy of this reporting package must be electronically submitted to the FAC.

######## Other sections of this part may apply.

(d)Program-specific audits are subject to:

(1) 200.500 Purpose through 200.503 Relation to other audit requirements, paragraph (d);

(2) 200.504 Frequency of audits through 200.506 Audit costs;

(3) 200.508 Auditee responsibilities through 200.509 Auditor selection;

(4) 200.511 Audit findings follow-up;

(5) 200.512 Report submission, paragraphs (e) through (h);

(6) 200.513 Responsibilities;

(7) 200.516 Audit findings through 200.517 Audit documentation;

(8) 200.521 Management decision; and

(9) Other referenced provisions of this part unless contrary to the provisions of this section, a program-specific audit guide, or program statutes and regulations.

###### Auditees

####### § 200.508 Auditee responsibilities.

The auditee must:

(a) Procure or otherwise arrange for the audit required by this part in accordance with § 200.509, and ensure it is properly performed and submitted when due in accordance with § 200.512.

(b) Prepare appropriate financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with § 200.510.

(c) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with § 200.511(b) and (c), respectively.

(d) Provide the auditor with access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and other information as needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this part.

####### § 200.509 Auditor selection.

######## Auditor procurement.

(a)In procuring audit services, the auditee must follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Procurement Standards in §§ 200.317 through 200.327 of subpart D of this part or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the non-Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in § 200.321, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.

######## Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.

(b)An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.

######## Use of Federal auditors.

(c)Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.

####### § 200.510 Financial statements.

######## Financial statements.

(a)The auditee must prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this part. However, non-Federal entity-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 200.514(a) and prepare separate financial statements.

######## Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.

(b)The auditee must also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements which must include the total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with § 200.502. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple Federal award years, the auditee may list the amount of Federal awards expended for each Federal award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:

(1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual Federal programs within the cluster of programs, and provide the applicable Federal agency name. For R&D, total Federal awards expended must be shown either by individual Federal award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.

(2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity must be included.

(3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the Assistance Listings Number or other identifying number when the Assistance Listings information is not available. For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.

(4) Include the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program.

(5) For loan or loan guarantee programs described in § 200.502(b), identify in the notes to the schedule the balances outstanding at the end of the audit period. This is in addition to including the total Federal awards expended for loan or loan guarantee programs in the schedule.

(6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the auditee elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in § 200.414.

####### § 200.511 Audit findings follow-up.

######## General.

(a)The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 200.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

######## Summary schedule of prior audit findings.

(b)The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.

(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.

(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:

(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the FAC;

(ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and

(iii) A management decision was not issued.

######## Corrective action plan.

(c)At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 200.516, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.

####### § 200.512 Report submission.

######## General.

(a)(1) The audit must be completed and the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.

(2) Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

######## Data collection.

(b)The FAC is the repository of record for subpart F of this part reporting packages and the data collection form. All Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC.

######## e.g.,

(1) The auditee must submit required data elements described in Appendix X to Part 200, which state whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The data must include information available from the audit required by this part that is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure integrity for Federal programs. The data elements and format must be approved by OMB, available from the FAC, and include collections of information from the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section. A senior level representative of the auditee (state controller, director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of this part, the data were prepared in accordance with this part (and the instructions accompanying the form), the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information, the information included in its entirety is accurate and complete, and that the FAC is authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available on a website.

######## Exception for Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations.

(2)An auditee that is an Indian tribe or a tribal organization (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination, Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 450b(l)) may opt not to authorize the FAC to make the reporting package publicly available on a Web site, by excluding the authorization for the FAC publication in the statement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If this option is exercised, the auditee becomes responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any pass-through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to pass-through entities for which the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any findings related to Federal awards that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation, if the auditee opts not to authorize publication, it must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection.

(3) Using the information included in the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section, the auditor must complete the applicable data elements of the data collection form. The auditor must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form that indicates, at a minimum, the source of the information included in the form, the auditor's responsibility for the information, that the form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section, and that the content of the form is limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB.

######## Reporting package.

(c)The reporting package must include the:

(1) Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards discussed in § 200.510(a) and (b), respectively;

(2) Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in § 200.511(b);

(3) Auditor's report(s) discussed in § 200.515; and

(4) Corrective action plan discussed in § 200.511(c).

######## Submission to FAC.

(d)The auditee must electronically submit to the FAC the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section.

######## Requests for management letters issued by the auditor.

(e)In response to requests by a Federal agency or pass-through entity, auditees must submit a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor.

######## Report retention requirements.

(f)Auditees must keep one copy of the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and one copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section on file for three years from the date of submission to the FAC.

######## FAC responsibilities.

(g)The FAC must make available the reporting packages received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 200.507(c) to the public, except for Indian tribes exercising the option in (b)(2) of this section, and maintain a data base of completed audits, provide appropriate information to Federal agencies, and follow up with known auditees that have not submitted the required data collection forms and reporting packages.

######## Electronic filing.

(h)Nothing in this part must preclude electronic submissions to the FAC in such manner as may be approved by OMB.

###### Federal Agencies

####### § 200.513 Responsibilities.

######## Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities.

(a)(1)A non-Federal entity expending more than $50 million a year in Federal awards must have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated cognizant agency for audit must be the Federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of funding directly (direct funding) (as listed on the Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see § 200.510(b)) to a non-Federal entity unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total expenditures (as direct and subawards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated cognizant agency for audit.

(2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years ending in 2019, and every fifth year thereafter.

(3) Notwithstanding the manner in which audit cognizance is determined, a Federal awarding agency with cognizance for an auditee may reassign cognizance to another Federal awarding agency that provides substantial funding and agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The cognizant agency for audit must:

(i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors.

(ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors, and provide the results to other interested organizations. Cooperate and provide support to the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a governmentwide project to determine the quality of single audits by providing a reliable estimate of the extent that single audits conform to applicable requirements, standards, and procedures; and to make recommendations to address noted audit quality issues, including recommendations for any changes to applicable requirements, standards and procedures indicated by the results of the project. The governmentwide project can rely on the current and on-going quality control review work performed by the agencies, State auditors, and professional audit associations. This governmentwide audit quality project must be performed once every 6 years (or at such other interval as determined by OMB), and the results must be public.

(iii) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate Federal law enforcement officials of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS or statutes and regulations.

(iv) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be referred to appropriate state licensing agencies and professional bodies.

(v) Advise the auditor, Federal awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate state licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.

(vi) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon rather than duplicate audits performed in accordance with this part.

(vii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings (see in § 200.1 of this part) that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal awarding agency whose awards are included in the audit finding of the auditee.

(viii) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.

(ix) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal years.

######## Oversight agency for audit responsibilities.,oversight agency for audit.

(b)An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with § 200.1A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to another Federal agency that agrees to be the oversight agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit:

(1) Must provide technical advice to auditees and auditors as requested.

(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.

######## Federal awarding agency responsibilities.

(c)The Federal awarding agency must perform the following for the Federal awards it makes (See also the requirements of § 200.211):

(1) Ensure that audits are completed and reports are received in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this part.

(2) Provide technical advice and counsel to auditees and auditors as requested.

(3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that the recipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. As part of audit follow-up, the Federal awarding agency must:

(i) Issue a management decision as prescribed in § 200.521;

(ii) Monitor the recipient taking appropriate and timely corrective action;

######## cooperative audit resolution

(iii) Use cooperative audit resolution mechanisms (see the definition ofin § 200.1 of this part) to improve Federal program outcomes through better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action; and

(iv) Develop a baseline, metrics, and targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow-up on audit findings and on the effectiveness of Single Audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability and their use by Federal awarding agencies in making award decisions.

(4) Provide OMB annual updates to the compliance supplement and work with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor to test the compliance requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse or generate audit finding for which the Federal awarding agency will take sanctions.

(5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy officials of the Federal awarding agency who must be:

(i) Responsible for ensuring that the agency fulfills all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal program outcomes.

(ii) Held accountable to improve the effectiveness of the single audit process based upon metrics as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.

(iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison.

(6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison who must:

(i) Serve as the Federal awarding agency's management point of contact for the single audit process both within and outside the Federal Government.

(ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and sharing in areas such as coordinating audit follow-up; identifying higher-risk non-Federal entities; providing input on single audit and follow-up policy; enhancing the utility of the FAC; and studying ways to use single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices.

(iii) Oversee training for the Federal awarding agency's program management personnel related to the single audit process.

(iv) Promote the Federal awarding agency's use of cooperative audit resolution mechanisms.

(v) Coordinate the Federal awarding agency's activities to ensure appropriate and timely follow-up and corrective action on audit findings.

(vi) Organize the Federal cognizant agency for audit's follow-up on cross-cutting audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one Federal awarding agency.

(vii) Ensure the Federal awarding agency provides annual updates of the compliance supplement to OMB.

(viii) Support the Federal awarding agency's single audit accountable official's mission.

###### Auditors

####### § 200.514 Scope of audit.

######## General.

(a)The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such audit period, provided that each such audit must encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period.

######## Financial statements.

(b)The auditor must determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

######## Internal control.

(c)(1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:

(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and

(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 200.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.

######## Compliance.

(d)(1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.

(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.

(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.

(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 200.516, assess the related control risk at the

######## Audit follow-up.

(e)The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 200.511(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor must perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program in the current year.

######## Data collection form.

(f)As required in § 200.512(b)(3), the auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.

####### § 200.515 Audit reporting.

The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

######## Financial statements.

(a)The auditor must determine and provide an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all materials respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by state law). The auditor must also decide whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control and compliance and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, it will refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance, include an opinion or disclaimer of opinion as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards which could have a direct and material effect on each major program and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:

(1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:

(i) The type of report the auditor issued on whether the financial statements audited were prepared in accordance with GAAP (i.e., unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

(ii) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements;

(iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements of the auditee;

(iv) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;

(v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs (i.e., unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 200.516(a);

(vii) An identification of major programs by listing each individual major program; however, in the case of a cluster of programs, only the cluster name as shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is required;

(viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in § 200.518(b)(1) or (3) when a recalculation of the Type A threshold is required for large loan or loan guarantees; and

(ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under § 200.520.

(2) Findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

(3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 200.516(a).

(i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue must be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.

(ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, must be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.

(e) Nothing in this part precludes combining of the audit reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 200.512(b) when allowed by GAGAS and appendix X to this part.

####### § 200.516 Audit findings.

######## Audit findings reported.

(a)The auditor must report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:

(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or a material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.

(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.

(3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.

(4) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.

(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is other than an unmodified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.

(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to report publicly information which could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.

(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 200.511(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

######## Audit finding detail and clarity.

(b)Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:

(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the Assistance Listings title and number or Federal award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.

(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.

(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.

(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.

(6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable Assistance Listings number(s) and applicable Federal award identification number(s).

(7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.

(8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.

(9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

(10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.

######## Reference numbers.

(c)Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission required by § 200.512(b) to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.

####### § 200.517 Audit documentation.

######## Retention of audit documentation.

(a)The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the audit documentation and reports.

######## Access to audit documentation.

(b)Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, cognizant agency for indirect cost, a Federal agency, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation, as is reasonable and necessary.

####### § 200.518 Major program determination.

######## General.

(a)The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach must include consideration of: current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section must be followed.

######## Step one.

(b)(1) The auditor must identify the larger Federal programs, which must be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the levels outlined in the table in this paragraph (b)(1):

(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be labeled Type B programs.

(3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans exceeds four times the largest non-loan program it is considered a large loan program, and the auditor must consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For the purposes of this paragraph a program is only considered to be a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal awards expended for loans within the program comprises fifty percent or more of the total Federal awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program and the value of Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in § 200.502.

(4) For biennial audits permitted under § 200.504, the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.

######## Step two.

(c)(1) The auditor must identify Type A programs which are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor must consider whether the requirements in § 200.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and preclude the program from being low risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the program must have not had:

(i) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);

(ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or

(iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for the program.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program may not be considered low risk for a certain recipient. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year at a particular recipient to allow the Federal awarding agency to comply with 31 U.S.C. 3515. The Federal awarding agency must notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited.

######## Step three.

(d)(1) The auditor must identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in § 200.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at least one fourth the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c) of this section). Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 200.519(b)(1) and (2) and (c)(1), a single criterion in risk would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to risk assess, the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.

(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed twenty-five percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in Step 1 (paragraph (b) of this section).

######## Step four.

(e)At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs:

(1) All Type A programs not identified as low risk under step two (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).

(2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three (paragraph (d) of this section).

(3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the number of Type A programs.

######## Percentage of coverage rule.

(f)If the auditee meets the criteria in § 200.520, the auditor need only audit the major programs identified in Step 4 (paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section) and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major programs identified in Step 4 (paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section) and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) of total Federal awards expended.

######## Documentation of risk.

(g)The auditor must include in the audit documentation the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.

######## Auditor's judgment.

(h)When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this Subpart, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs must be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities must only be for clearly improper use of the requirements in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor must consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.

####### § 200.519 Criteria for Federal program risk.

######## General.

(a)The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the Federal program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.

######## Current and prior audit experience.

(b)(1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.

(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.

(ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.

(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.

(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.

######## Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.

(c)(1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.

(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.

######## Inherent risk of the Federal program.

(d)(1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third-party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of § 200.430, but otherwise be at low risk.

(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.

(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.

(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

####### § 200.520 Criteria for a low-risk auditee.

An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods must qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with § 200.518.

(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart, including submitting the data collection form and the reporting package to the FAC within the timeframe specified in § 200.512. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.

(b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, or a basis of accounting required by state law, and the auditor's in relation to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unmodified.

(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.

(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.

(e) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:

(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);

(2) A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or

(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.

###### Management Decisions

####### § 200.521 Management decision.

######## General.

(a)The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

######## Federal agency.

(b)As provided in § 200.513(a)(3)(vii), the cognizant agency for audit must be responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. As provided in § 200.513(c)(3)(i), a Federal awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to non-Federal entities.

######## Pass-through entity.

(c)As provided in § 200.332(d), the pass-through entity must be responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.

######## Time requirements.

(d)The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within six months of acceptance of the audit report by the FAC. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.

######## Reference numbers.

(e)Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 200.516(c).

##### Appendix I to Part 200 - Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity

The full text of the notice of funding opportunity is organized in sections. The required format outlined in this appendix indicates immediately following the title of each section whether that section is required in every announcement or is a Federal awarding agency option. The format is designed so that similar types of information will appear in the same sections in announcements of different Federal funding opportunities. Toward that end, there is text in each of the following sections to describe the types of information that a Federal awarding agency would include in that section of an actual announcement.

A Federal awarding agency that wishes to include information that the format does not specifically discuss may address that subject in whatever section(s) is most appropriate. For example, if a Federal awarding agency chooses to address performance goals in the announcement, it might do so in the funding opportunity description, the application content, or the reporting requirements.

Similarly, when this format calls for a type of information to be in a particular section, a Federal awarding agency wishing to address that subject in other sections may elect to repeat the information in those sections or use cross references between the sections (there should be hyperlinks for cross-references in any electronic versions of the announcement). For example, a Federal awarding agency may want to include Section A information about the types of non-Federal entities who are eligible to apply. The format specifies a standard location for that information in Section C.1 but does not preclude repeating the information in Section A or creating a cross reference between Section A and C.1, as long as a potential applicant can find the information quickly and easily from the standard location.

The sections of the full text of the announcement are described in the following paragraphs.

###### e.g.,

This section contains the full program description of the funding opportunity. It may be as long as needed to adequately communicate to potential applicants the areas in which funding may be provided. It describes the Federal awarding agency's funding priorities or the technical or focus areas in which the Federal awarding agency intends to provide assistance. As appropriate, it may include any program history (whether this is a new program or a new or changed area of program emphasis). This section must include program goals and objectives, a reference to the relevant Assistance Listings, a description of how the award will contribute to the achievement of the program's goals and objectives, and the expected performance goals, indicators, targets, baseline data, data collection, and other outcomes such Federal awarding agency expects to achieve, and may include examples of successful projects that have been funded previously. This section also may include other information the Federal awarding agency deems necessary, and must at a minimum include citations for authorizing statutes and regulations for the funding opportunity.

This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision about whether to submit a proposal. Relevant information could include the total amount of funding that the Federal awarding agency expects to award through the announcement; the expected performance indicators, targets, baseline data, and data collection; the anticipated number of Federal awards; the expected amounts of individual Federal awards (which may be a range); the amount of funding per Federal award, on average, experienced in previous years; and the anticipated start dates and periods of performance for new Federal awards. This section also should address whether applications for renewal or supplementation of existing projects are eligible to compete with applications for new Federal awards.

###### e.g.,,e.g.,

This section also must indicate the type(s) of assistance instrument (grant, cooperative agreement) that may be awarded if applications are successful. If cooperative agreements may be awarded, this section either should describe the "substantial involvement" that the Federal awarding agency expects to have or should reference where the potential applicant can find that information (in the funding opportunity description in Section A. or Federal award administration information in Section D. If procurement contracts also may be awarded, this must be stated.

This section addresses the considerations or factors that determine applicant or application eligibility. This includes the eligibility of particular types of applicant organizations, any factors affecting the eligibility of the principal investigator or project director, and any criteria that make particular projects ineligible. Federal agencies should make clear whether an applicant's failure to meet an eligibility criterion by the time of an application deadline will result in the Federal awarding agency returning the application without review or, even though an application may be reviewed, will preclude the Federal awarding agency from making a Federal award. Key elements to be addressed are:

###### Eligible Applicants-Required.

1.Announcements must clearly identify the types of entities that are eligible to apply. If there are no restrictions on eligibility, this section may simply indicate that all potential applicants are eligible. If there are restrictions on eligibility, it is important to be clear about the specific types of entities that are eligible, not just the types that are ineligible. For example, if the program is limited to nonprofit organizations subject to 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) of the tax code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), the announcement should say so. Similarly, it is better to state explicitly that Native American tribal organizations are eligible than to assume that they can unambiguously infer that from a statement that nonprofit organizations may apply. Eligibility also can be expressed by exception, (e.g., open to all types of domestic applicants other than individuals). This section should refer to any portion of Section D specifying documentation that must be submitted to support an eligibility determination (e.g., proof of 501(c)(3) status as determined by the Internal Revenue Service or an authorizing tribal resolution). To the extent that any funding restriction in Section D.6 could affect the eligibility of an applicant or project, the announcement must either restate that restriction in this section or provide a cross-reference to its description in Section D.6.

###### Cost Sharing or Matching-Required.,e.g.,,e.g.,

2.Announcements must state whether there is required cost sharing, matching, or cost participation without which an application would be ineligible (if cost sharing is not required, the announcement must explicitly say so). Required cost sharing may be a certain percentage or amount, or may be in the form of contributions of specified items or activities (provision of equipment). It is important that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of cost (in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing. Cost sharing as an eligibility criterion includes requirements based in statute or regulation, as described in § 200.306 of this Part. This section should refer to the appropriate portion(s) of section D. stating any pre-award requirements for submission of letters or other documentation to verify commitments to meet cost-sharing requirements if a Federal award is made.

###### Other-Required, if applicable.

3.If there are other eligibility criteria (i.e., criteria that have the effect of making an application or project ineligible for Federal awards, whether referred to as "responsiveness" criteria, "go-no go" criteria, "threshold" criteria, or in other ways), must be clearly stated and must include a reference to the regulation of requirement that describes the restriction, as applicable. For example, if entities that have been found to be in violation of a particular Federal statute are ineligible, it is important to say so. This section must also state any limit on the number of applications an applicant may submit under the announcement and make clear whether the limitation is on the submitting organization, individual investigator/program director, or both. This section should also address any eligibility criteria for beneficiaries or for program participants other than Federal award recipients.

###### Address to Request Application Package-Required.

1.Potential applicants must be told how to get application forms, kits, or other materials needed to apply (if this announcement contains everything needed, this section need only say so). An Internet address where the materials can be accessed is acceptable. However, since high-speed Internet access is not yet universally available for downloading documents, and applicants may have additional accessibility requirements, there also should be a way for potential applicants to request paper copies of materials, such as a U.S. Postal Service mailing address, telephone or FAX number, Telephone Device for the Deaf (TDD), Text Telephone (TTY) number, and/or Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) number.

###### Content and Form of Application Submission-Required.

2.This section must identify the required content of an application and the forms or formats that an applicant must use to submit it. If any requirements are stated elsewhere because they are general requirements that apply to multiple programs or funding opportunities, this section should refer to where those requirements may be found. This section also should include required forms or formats as part of the announcement or state where the applicant may obtain them.

This section should specifically address content and form or format requirements for:

i. Pre-applications, letters of intent, or white papers required or encouraged (see Section D.4), including any limitations on the number of pages or other formatting requirements similar to those for full applications.

ii. The application as a whole. For all submissions, this would include any limitations on the number of pages, font size and typeface, margins, paper size, number of copies, and sequence or assembly requirements. If electronic submission is permitted or required, this could include special requirements for formatting or signatures.

iii. Component pieces of the application (e.g., if all copies of the application must bear original signatures on the face page or the program narrative may not exceed 10 pages). This includes any pieces that may be submitted separately by third parties (e.g., references or letters confirming commitments from third parties that will be contributing a portion of any required cost sharing).

iv. Information that successful applicants must submit after notification of intent to make a Federal award, but prior to a Federal award. This could include evidence of compliance with requirements relating to human subjects or information needed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370h).

###### Unique entity identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)-Required.

3.This paragraph must state clearly that each applicant (unless the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is excepted from those requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d)) is required to: (i) Be registered in SAM before submitting its application; (ii) Provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application; and (iii) Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency. It also must state that the Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant.

###### Submission Dates and Times-Required.,e.g.,

4.Announcements must identify due dates and times for all submissions. This includes not only the full applications but also any preliminary submissions (letters of intent, white papers, or pre-applications). It also includes any other submissions of information before Federal award that are separate from the full application. If the funding opportunity is a general announcement that is open for a period of time with no specific due dates for applications, this section should say so. Note that the information on dates that is included in this section also must appear with other overview information in a location preceding the full text of the announcement (see § 200.204 of this part).

###### Intergovernmental Review-Required, if applicable.

5.If the funding opportunity is subject to Executive Order 12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs," the notice must say so and applicants must contact their state's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to find out about and comply with the state's process under Executive Order 12372, it may be useful to inform potential applicants that the names and addresses of the SPOCs are listed in the Office of Management and Budget's website.

###### Funding Restrictions-Required.

6.Notices must include information on funding restrictions in order to allow an applicant to develop an application and budget consistent with program requirements. Examples are whether construction is an allowable activity, if there are any limitations on direct costs such as foreign travel or equipment purchases, and if there are any limits on indirect costs (or facilities and administrative costs). Applicants must be advised if Federal awards will not allow reimbursement of pre-Federal award costs.

###### Other Submission Requirements- Required.

7.This section must address any other submission requirements not included in the other paragraphs of this section. This might include the format of submission, i.e., paper or electronic, for each type of required submission. Applicants should not be required to submit in more than one format and this section should indicate whether they may choose whether to submit applications in hard copy or electronically, may submit only in hard copy, or may submit only electronically.

This section also must indicate where applications (and any pre-applications) must be submitted if sent by postal mail, electronic means, or hand-delivery. For postal mail submission, this must include the name of an office, official, individual or function (e.g., application receipt center) and a complete mailing address. For electronic submission, this must include the URL or email address; whether a password(s) is required; whether particular software or other electronic capabilities are required; what to do in the event of system problems and a point of contact who will be available in the event the applicant experiences technical difficulties.

###### Criteria-Required.

1.This section must address the criteria that the Federal awarding agency will use to evaluate applications. This includes the merit and other review criteria that evaluators will use to judge applications, including any statutory, regulatory, or other preferences (e.g., minority status or Native American tribal preferences) that will be applied in the review process. These criteria are distinct from eligibility criteria that are addressed before an application is accepted for review and any program policy or other factors that are applied during the selection process, after the review process is completed. The intent is to make the application process transparent so applicants can make informed decisions when preparing their applications to maximize fairness of the process. The announcement should clearly describe all criteria, including any sub-criteria. If criteria vary in importance, the announcement should specify the relative percentages, weights, or other means used to distinguish among them. For statutory, regulatory, or other preferences, the announcement should provide a detailed explanation of those preferences with an explicit indication of their effect (e.g., whether they result in additional points being assigned).

If an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered in the review process (as opposed to being an eligibility criterion described in Section C.2), the announcement must specifically address how it will be considered (e.g., to assign a certain number of additional points to applicants who offer cost sharing, or to break ties among applications with equivalent scores after evaluation against all other factors). If cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation, the announcement should say so, so that there is no ambiguity for potential applicants. Vague statements that cost sharing is encouraged, without clarification as to what that means, are unhelpful to applicants. It also is important that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of cost (e.g., in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing.

###### Review and Selection Process-Required.

2.This section may vary in the level of detail provided. The announcement must list any program policy or other factors or elements, other than merit criteria, that the selecting official may use in selecting applications for Federal award (e.g., geographical dispersion, program balance, or diversity). The Federal awarding agency may also include other appropriate details. For example, this section may indicate who is responsible for evaluation against the merit criteria (e.g., peers external to the Federal awarding agency or Federal awarding agency personnel) and/or who makes the final selections for Federal awards. If there is a multi-phase review process (e.g., an external panel advising internal Federal awarding agency personnel who make final recommendations to the deciding official), the announcement may describe the phases. It also may include: the number of people on an evaluation panel and how it operates, the way reviewers are selected, reviewer qualifications, and the way that conflicts of interest are avoided. With respect to electronic methods for providing information about funding opportunities or accepting applicants' submissions of information, each Federal awarding agency is responsible for compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).

In addition, if the Federal awarding agency permits applicants to nominate suggested reviewers of their applications or suggest those they feel may be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest, that information should be included in this section.

3. For any Federal award under a notice of funding opportunity, if the Federal awarding agency anticipates that the total Federal share will be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold on any Federal award under a notice of funding opportunity may include, over the period of performance, this section must also inform applicants:

i. That the Federal awarding agency, prior to making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS) (see 41 U.S.C. 2313);

ii. That an applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through SAM and comment on any information about itself that a Federal awarding agency previously entered and is currently in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM;

iii. That the Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the other information in the designated integrity and performance system, in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in § 200.206.

###### Anticipated Announcement and Federal Award Dates-Optional.

4.This section is intended to provide applicants with information they can use for planning purposes. If there is a single application deadline followed by the simultaneous review of all applications, the Federal awarding agency can include in this section information about the anticipated dates for announcing or notifying successful and unsuccessful applicants and for having Federal awards in place. If applications are received and evaluated on a "rolling" basis at different times during an extended period, it may be appropriate to give applicants an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal awarding agency's decision.

###### 1. Federal Award Notices-Required.

This section must address what a successful applicant can expect to receive following selection. If the Federal awarding agency's practice is to provide a separate notice stating that an application has been selected before it actually makes the Federal award, this section would be the place to indicate that the letter is not an authorization to begin performance (to the extent that it allows charging to Federal awards of pre-award costs at the non-Federal entity's own risk). This section should indicate that the notice of Federal award signed by the grants officer (or equivalent) is the authorizing document, and whether it is provided through postal mail or by electronic means and to whom. It also may address the timing, form, and content of notifications to unsuccessful applicants. See also § 200.211.

###### 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements-Required

. This section must identify the usual administrative and national policy requirements the Federal awarding agency's Federal awards may include. Providing this information lets a potential applicant identify any requirements with which it would have difficulty complying if its application is successful. In those cases, early notification about the requirements allows the potential applicant to decide not to apply or to take needed actions before receiving the Federal award. The announcement need not include all of the terms and conditions of the Federal award, but may refer to a document (with information about how to obtain it) or Internet site where applicants can see the terms and conditions. If this funding opportunity will lead to Federal awards with some special terms and conditions that differ from the Federal awarding agency's usual (sometimes called "general") terms and conditions, this section should highlight those special terms and conditions. Doing so will alert applicants that have received Federal awards from the Federal awarding agency previously and might not otherwise expect different terms and conditions. For the same reason, the announcement should inform potential applicants about special requirements that could apply to particular Federal awards after the review of applications and other information, based on the particular circumstances of the effort to be supported (e.g., if human subjects were to be involved or if some situations may justify special terms on intellectual property, data sharing or security requirements).

###### Reporting-Required.,e.g.,,e.g.,

3.This section must include general information about the type (financial or performance), frequency, and means of submission (paper or electronic) of post-Federal award reporting requirements. Highlight any special reporting requirements for Federal awards under this funding opportunity that differ (by report type, frequency, form/format, or circumstances for use) from what the Federal awarding agency's Federal awards usually require. Federal awarding agencies must also describe in this section all relevant requirements such as those at 2 CFR 180.335 and 180.350.

If the Federal share of any Federal award may include more than $500,000 over the period of performance, this section must inform potential applicants about the post award reporting requirements reflected in appendix XII to this part.

The announcement must give potential applicants a point(s) of contact for answering questions or helping with problems while the funding opportunity is open. The intent of this requirement is to be as helpful as possible to potential applicants, so the Federal awarding agency should consider approaches such as giving:

i. Points of contact who may be reached in multiple ways (e.g., by telephone, FAX, and/or email, as well as regular mail).

ii. A fax or email address that multiple people access, so that someone will respond even if others are unexpectedly absent during critical periods.

iii. Different contacts for distinct kinds of help (e.g., one for questions of programmatic content and a second for administrative questions).

This section may include any additional information that will assist a potential applicant. For example, the section might:

i. Indicate whether this is a new program or a one-time initiative.

ii. Mention related programs or other upcoming or ongoing Federal awarding agency funding opportunities for similar activities.

iii. Include current Internet addresses for Federal awarding agency Web sites that may be useful to an applicant in understanding the program.

iv. Alert applicants to the need to identify proprietary information and inform them about the way the Federal awarding agency will handle it.

v. Include certain routine notices to applicants (e.g., that the Federal Government is not obligated to make any Federal award as a result of the announcement or that only grants officers can bind the Federal Government to the expenditure of funds).

##### Appendix II to Part 200 - Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards

In addition to other provisions required by the Federal agency or non-Federal entity, all contracts made by the non-Federal entity under the Federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as applicable.

(A) Contracts for more than the simplified acquisition threshold, which is the inflation adjusted amount determined by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (Councils) as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 1908, must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as appropriate.

(B) All contracts in excess of $10,000 must address termination for cause and for convenience by the non-Federal entity including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.

(C) Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under 41 CFR Part 60, all contracts that meet the definition of "federally assisted construction contract" in 41 CFR Part 60-1.3 must include the equal opportunity clause provided under 41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance with Executive Order 11246, "Equal Employment Opportunity" (30 FR 12319, 12935, 3 CFR Part, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), as amended by Executive Order 11375, "Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity," and implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60, "Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor."

(D) Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-3148). When required by Federal program legislation, all prime construction contracts in excess of $2,000 awarded by non-Federal entities must include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-3144, and 3146-3148) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5, "Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Covering Federally Financed and Assisted Construction"). In accordance with the statute, contractors must be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors must be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The non-Federal entity must place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation. The decision to award a contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency. The contracts must also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3, "Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United States"). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient must be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is otherwise entitled. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.

(E) Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701-3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.

(F) Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement. If the Federal award meets the definition of "funding agreement" under 37 CFR § 401.2 (a) and the recipient or subrecipient wishes to enter into a contract with a small business firm or nonprofit organization regarding the substitution of parties, assignment or performance of experimental, developmental, or research work under that "funding agreement," the recipient or subrecipient must comply with the requirements of 37 CFR Part 401, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements," and any implementing regulations issued by the awarding agency.

(G) Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387), as amended-Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that requires the non-Federal award to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

(H) Debarment and Suspension (Executive Orders 12549 and 12689)-A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the governmentwide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR 180 that implement Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235), "Debarment and Suspension." SAM Exclusions contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549.

(I) Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)-Contractors that apply or bid for an award exceeding $100,000 must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award.

(J) See § 200.323.

(K) See § 200.216.

(L) See § 200.322.

##### Appendix III to Part 200 - Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)

This appendix provides criteria for identifying and computing indirect (or indirect (F&A)) rates at IHEs (institutions). Indirect (F&A) costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity. See subsection B.1 for a discussion of the components of indirect (F&A) costs.

Refers to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities and other institutional activities as defined in this section:

###### Instruction

a.means the teaching and training activities of an institution. Except for research training as provided in subsection b, this term includes all teaching and training activities, whether they are offered for credits toward a degree or certificate or on a non-credit basis, and whether they are offered through regular academic departments or separate divisions, such as a summer school division or an extension division. Also considered part of this major function are departmental research, and, where agreed to, university research.

###### Sponsored instruction and training

(1)means specific instructional or training activity established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. For purposes of the cost principles, this activity may be considered a major function even though an institution's accounting treatment may include it in the instruction function.

###### Departmental research

(2)means research, development and scholarly activities that are not organized research and, consequently, are not separately budgeted and accounted for. Departmental research, for purposes of this document, is not considered as a major function, but as a part of the instruction function of the institution.

(3) Only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically committed in the project budget must be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect (F&A) cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Salary costs above statutory limits are not considered cost sharing.

###### Organized research

b.means all research and development activities of an institution that are separately budgeted and accounted for. It includes:

###### Sponsored research

(1)means all research and development activities that are sponsored by Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations. This term includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques (commonly called research training) where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.

###### University research

(2)means all research and development activities that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the institution under an internal application of institutional funds. University research, for purposes of this document, must be combined with sponsored research under the function of organized research.

###### Other sponsored activities

c.means programs and projects financed by Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations which involve the performance of work other than instruction and organized research. Examples of such programs and projects are health service projects and community service programs. However, when any of these activities are undertaken by the institution without outside support, they may be classified as other institutional activities.

###### Other institutional activities

d.means all activities of an institution except for instruction, departmental research, organized research, and other sponsored activities, as defined in this section; indirect (F&A) cost activities identified in this Appendix paragraph B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A) costs; and specialized services facilities described in § 200.468 of this part.

###### Base period.

a.A base period for distribution of indirect (F&A) costs is the period during which the costs are incurred. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by the institution, but in any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.

###### Need for cost groupings.

b.The overall objective of the indirect (F&A) cost allocation process is to distribute the indirect (F&A) costs described in Section B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A) costs, to the major functions of the institution in proportions reasonably consistent with the nature and extent of their use of the institution's resources. In order to achieve this objective, it may be necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of cost within one or more of the indirect (F&A) cost categories referred to in subsection B.1. In general, the cost groupings established within a category should constitute, in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to be of like nature in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the particular cost objectives to which distribution is appropriate. Cost groupings should be established considering the general guides provided in subsection c of this section. Each such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to the related cost objectives, using the distribution base or method most appropriate in light of the guidelines set forth in subsection d of this section.

###### General considerations on cost groupings.

c.The extent to which separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate at an institution is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two or more separate cost groupings (based on account classification or analysis) within an indirect (F&A) cost category include but are not limited to the following:

(1) If certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one of the major functions of the institution or to less than all functions, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for direct assignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides provided in subsections b and d.

(2) If any types of expense ordinarily treated as general administration or departmental administration are charged to Federal awards as direct costs, expenses applicable to other activities of the institution when incurred for the same purposes in like circumstances must, through separate cost groupings, be excluded from the indirect (F&A) costs allocable to those Federal awards and included in the direct cost of other activities for cost allocation purposes.

(3) If it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to organized research, instructional, and other activities at the institution or within the department.

(4) If activities provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance or similar service, the distribution of general administration and general expenses, or operation and maintenance expenses to such activities should be accomplished through cost groupings which include only that portion of central indirect (F&A) costs (such as for overall management) which are properly allocable to such activities.

(5) If the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirect (F&A) charges, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related cost objectives.

(6) The number of separate cost groupings within a category should be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution.

d. Selection of distribution method.

(1) Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or base to be used in distributing individual cost groupings. The essential consideration in selecting a base is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect relationship; or with logic and reason, where neither benefit nor a cause-and-effect relationship is determinable.

(2) If a cost grouping can be identified directly with the cost objective benefitted, it should be assigned to that cost objective.

(3) If the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution may be based on a cost analysis study which results in an equitable distribution of the costs. Such cost analysis studies may take into consideration weighting factors, population, or space occupied if appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must (a) be appropriately documented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by the cognizant agency for indirect costs, (b) distribute the costs to the related cost objectives in accordance with the relative benefits derived, (c) be statistically sound, (d) be performed specifically at the institution at which the results are to be used, and (e) be reviewed periodically, but not less frequently than rate negotiations, updated if necessary, and used consistently. Any assumptions made in the study must be stated and explained. The use of cost analysis studies and periodic changes in the method of cost distribution must be fully justified.

(4) If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study does not result in an equitable distribution of the costs, the distribution must be made in accordance with the appropriate base cited in Section B, unless one of the following conditions is met:

(a) It can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards, or

(b) The institution qualifies for, and elects to use, the simplified method for computing indirect (F&A) cost rates described in Section D.

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), effective July 1, 1998, a cost analysis or base other than that in Section B must not be used to distribute utility or student services costs. Instead, subsection B.4.c, may be used in the recovery of utility costs.

e. Order of distribution.

(1) Indirect (F&A) costs are the broad categories of costs discussed in Section B.1.

(2) Depreciation, interest expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and general administrative and general expenses should be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect (F&A) cost categories as well as to the major functions and specialized service facilities of the institution. Other cost categories may be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the institutions. When cross allocation of costs is made as provided in subsection (3), this order of allocation does not apply.

(3) Normally an indirect (F&A) cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs may not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect (F&A) cost categories may be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect (F&A) cost categories described in Section B is required.

See § 200.414 which provides the basis for these indirect cost requirements.

a. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the institution's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 200.436.

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the following manner:

(1) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.

(2) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas such as hallways, stairwells, and rest rooms.

(3) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related to space (e.g., individual rooms, laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to benefitting functions on the basis of:

(a) The employee full-time equivalents (FTEs) or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or

(b) Institution-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting major functions (see Section A.1) of the institution.

(4) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories of students and employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The amount allocated to the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution. The amount allocated to the employee category must be further allocated to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to those functions.

Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, as defined in § 200.449, must be classified as an expenditure under the category Facilities. These costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital improvements to which the interest relates.

a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, supervision, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the institution's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the same manner as described in subsection 2.b for depreciation.

c. A utility cost adjustment of up to 1.3 percentage points may be included in the negotiated indirect cost rate of the IHE for organized research, per the computation alternatives in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Where space is devoted to a single function and metering allows unambiguous measurement of usage related to that space, costs must be assigned to the function located in that space.

(2) Where space is allocated to different functions and metering does not allow unambiguous measurement of usage by function, costs must be allocated as follows:

(i) Utilities costs should be apportioned to functions in the same manner as depreciation, based on the calculated difference between the site or building actual square footage for monitored research laboratory space (site, building, floor, or room), and a separate calculation prepared by the IHE using the "effective square footage" described in subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) "Effective square footage" allocated to research laboratory space must be calculated as the actual square footage times the relative energy utilization index (REUI) posted on the OMB Web site at the time of a rate determination.

A. This index is the ratio of a laboratory energy use index (lab EUI) to the corresponding index for overall average college or university space (college EUI).

B. In July 2012, values for these two indices (taken respectively from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory "Labs for the 21st Century" benchmarking tool and the US Department of Energy "Buildings Energy Databook" and were 310 kBtu/sq ft-yr. and 155 kBtu/sq ft-yr., so that the adjustment ratio is 2.0 by this methodology. To retain currency, OMB will adjust the EUI numbers from time to time (no more often than annually nor less often than every 5 years), using reliable and publicly disclosed data. Current values of both the EUIs and the REUI will be posted on the OMB website.

###### i.e.,

a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the general executive and administrative offices of educational institutions and other expenses of a general character which do not relate solely to any major function of the institution;solely to (1) instruction, (2) organized research, (3) other sponsored activities, or (4) other institutional activities. The general administration and general expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of general administration and general expenses include: Those expenses incurred by administrative offices that serve the entire university system of which the institution is a part; central offices of the institution such as the President's or Chancellor's office, the offices for institution-wide financial management, business services, budget and planning, personnel management, and safety and risk management; the office of the General Counsel; and the operations of the central administrative management information systems. General administration and general expenses must not include expenses incurred within non-university-wide deans' offices, academic departments, organized research units, or similar organizational units. (See subsection 6.)

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be grouped first according to common major functions of the institution to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to serviced or benefitted functions on the modified total cost basis. Modified total costs consist of the same elements as those in Section C.2. When an activity included in this indirect (F&A) cost category provides a service or product to another institution or organization, an appropriate adjustment must be made to either the expenses or the basis of allocation or both, to assure a proper allocation of costs.

a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for administrative and supporting services that benefit common or joint departmental activities or objectives in academic deans' offices, academic departments and divisions, and organized research units. Organized research units include such units as institutes, study centers, and research centers. Departmental administration expenses are subject to the following limitations.

(1) Academic deans' offices. Salaries and operating expenses are limited to those attributable to administrative functions.

(2) Academic departments:

(a) Salaries and fringe benefits attributable to the administrative work (including bid and proposal preparation) of faculty (including department heads) and other professional personnel conducting research and/or instruction, must be allowed at a rate of 3.6 percent of modified total direct costs. This category does not include professional business or professional administrative officers. This allowance must be added to the computation of the indirect (F&A) cost rate for major functions in Section C; the expenses covered by the allowance must be excluded from the departmental administration cost pool. No documentation is required to support this allowance.

(b) Other administrative and supporting expenses incurred within academic departments are allowable provided they are treated consistently in like circumstances. This would include expenses such as the salaries of secretarial and clerical staffs, the salaries of administrative officers and assistants, travel, office supplies, stockrooms, and the like.

(3) Other fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included in subsections (1) and (2) are allowable, as well as an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation.

(4) Federal agencies may authorize reimbursement of additional costs for department heads and faculty only in exceptional cases where an institution can demonstrate undue hardship or detriment to project performance.

b. The following guidelines apply to the determination of departmental administrative costs as direct or indirect (F&A) costs.

###### e.g.,

(1) In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect (F&A) costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, laboratory supplies (chemicals), telephone toll charges, animals, animal care costs, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized shop costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular cost objective. Direct charging of these costs may be accomplished through specific identification of individual costs to benefitting cost objectives, or through recharge centers or specialized service facilities, as appropriate under the circumstances. See §§ 200.413(c) and 200.468.

(2) Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, and memberships must normally be treated as indirect (F&A) costs.

c. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated as follows:

(1) The administrative expenses of the dean's office of each college and school must be allocated to the academic departments within that college or school on the modified total cost basis.

(2) The administrative expenses of each academic department, and the department's share of the expenses allocated in subsection (1) must be allocated to the appropriate functions of the department on the modified total cost basis.

a. The expenses under this heading are limited to those incurred by a separate organization(s) established primarily to administer sponsored projects, including such functions as grant and contract administration (Federal and non-Federal), special security, purchasing, personnel, administration, and editing and publishing of research and other reports. They include the salaries and expenses of the head of such organization, assistants, and immediate staff, together with the salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in supporting activities maintained by the organization, such as stock rooms, print shops, and the like. This category also includes an allocable share of fringe benefit costs, general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Appropriate adjustments will be made for services provided to other functions or organizations.

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated to the major functions of the institution under which the sponsored projects are conducted on the basis of the modified total cost of sponsored projects.

c. An appropriate adjustment must be made to eliminate any duplicate charges to Federal awards when this category includes similar or identical activities as those included in the general administration and general expense category or other indirect (F&A) cost items, such as accounting, procurement, or personnel administration.

a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the operation of the library, including the cost of books and library materials purchased for the library, less any items of library income that qualify as applicable credits under § 200.406. The library expense category should also include the fringe benefits applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expense, operation and maintenance expense, and depreciation. Costs incurred in the purchases of rare books (museum-type books) with no value to Federal awards should not be allocated to them.

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated first on the basis of primary categories of users, including students, professional employees, and other users.

(1) The student category must consist of full-time equivalent students enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether they earn credits toward a degree or certificate.

(2) The professional employee category must consist of all faculty members and other professional employees of the institution, on a full-time equivalent basis. This category may also include post-doctorate fellows and graduate students.

(3) The other users category must consist of a reasonable factor as determined by institutional records to account for all other users of library facilities.

c. Amount allocated in paragraph b of this section must be assigned further as follows:

(1) The amount in the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution.

(2) The amount in the professional employee category must be assigned to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all faculty members and other professional employees applicable to those functions.

(3) The amount in the other users category must be assigned to the other institutional activities function of the institution.

a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration of student affairs and for services to students, including expenses of such activities as deans of students, admissions, registrar, counseling and placement services, student advisers, student health and infirmary services, catalogs, and commencements and convocations. The salaries of members of the academic staff whose responsibilities to the institution require administrative work that benefits sponsored projects may also be included to the extent that the portion charged to student administration is determined in accordance with subpart E of this Part. This expense category also includes the fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance, interest expense, and depreciation.

b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses in this category must be allocated to the instruction function, and subsequently to Federal awards in that function.

a. The items to be accumulated under this heading are the reimbursements and other payments from the Federal Government which are made to the institution to support solely, specifically, and directly, in whole or in part, any of the administrative or service activities described in subsections 2 through 9.

b. The items in this group must be treated as a credit to the affected individual indirect (F&A) cost category before that category is allocated to benefitting functions.

a. (1) Subject to subsection b, the separate categories of indirect (F&A) costs allocated to each major function of the institution as prescribed in Section B, must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The amount in each pool must be divided by the distribution base described in subsection 2 to arrive at a single indirect (F&A) cost rate for each function.

(2) The rate for each function is used to distribute indirect (F&A) costs to individual Federal awards of that function. Since a common pool is established for each major function of the institution, a separate indirect (F&A) cost rate would be established for each of the major functions described in Section A.1 under which Federal awards are carried out.

(3) Each institution's indirect (F&A) cost rate process must be appropriately designed to ensure that Federal sponsors do not in any way subsidize the indirect (F&A) costs of other sponsors, specifically activities sponsored by industry and foreign governments. Accordingly, each allocation method used to identify and allocate the indirect (F&A) cost pools, as described in Sections A.2 and B.2 through B.9, must contain the full amount of the institution's modified total costs or other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations. In addition, the final rate distribution base (as defined in subsection 2) for each major function (organized research, instruction, etc., as described in Section A.1 functions of an institution) must contain all the programs or activities which utilize the indirect (F&A) costs allocated to that major function. At the time an indirect (F&A) cost proposal is submitted to a cognizant agency for indirect costs, each institution must describe the process it uses to ensure that Federal funds are not used to subsidize industry and foreign government funded programs.

Indirect (F&A) costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function (see section A.1) on the basis of modified total direct costs (MTDC), consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the subaward). MTDC is defined in § 200.1. For this purpose, an indirect (F&A) cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect (F&A) cost pools developed pursuant to subsection 1. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect (F&A) cost pool is of the modified total direct costs identified with such pool.

A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect (F&A) costs may be appropriate for self-contained, off-campus, or primarily subcontracted activities where the benefits derived from an institution's indirect (F&A) services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiated indirect (F&A) costs will be treated as an offset before allocation to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities, and other institutional activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.

Public Law 87-638 (76 Stat. 437) as amended (41 U.S.C. 4708) authorizes the use of predetermined rates in determining the "indirect costs" (indirect (F&A) costs) applicable under research agreements with educational institutions. The stated objectives of the law are to simplify the administration of cost-type research and development contracts (including grants) with educational institutions, to facilitate the preparation of their budgets, and to permit more expeditious closeout of such contracts when the work is completed. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F&A) costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F&A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.

When a fixed rate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or other time period), the over- or under-recovery for that year may be included as an adjustment to the indirect (F&A) cost for the next rate negotiation. When the rate is negotiated before the carry-forward adjustment is determined, the carry-forward amount may be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustments are to be made, each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given period will be computed by applying the expected indirect (F&A) costs allocable to Federal awards for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-forward adjustment (over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the forecast distribution base. Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum agreements or cost-sharing provisions of prior years must not be carried forward for consideration in the new rate negotiation. There must, however, be an advance understanding in each case between the institution and the cognizant agency for indirect costs as to whether these differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather than making the determination after the differences are known. Further, institutions electing to use this carry-forward provision may not subsequently change without prior approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In the event that an institution returns to a post-determined rate, any over- or under-recovery during the period in which negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions were followed will be included in the subsequent post-determined rates. Where multiple rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable for determining each rate.

Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs determines that cost experience and other pertinent facts do not justify the use of predetermined rates, or a fixed rate with a carry-forward, or if the parties cannot agree on an equitable rate, a provisional rate must be established. To prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment, the provisional rate may be adjusted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs during the institution's fiscal year. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the institution's fiscal year. If a provisional rate is not replaced by a predetermined or fixed rate prior to the end of the institution's fiscal year, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.

a. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of § 200.414, Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the Federal award. Award levels for Federal awards may not be adjusted in future years as a result of changes in negotiated rates. "Negotiated rates" per the rate agreement include final, fixed, and predetermined rates and exclude provisional rates. "Life" for the purpose of this subsection means each competitive segment of a project. A competitive segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at the time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not extend through the life of the Federal award at the time of the initial award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award must be extended through the end of the life of the Federal award.

b. Except as provided in § 200.414, when an educational institution does not have a negotiated rate with the Federal Government at the time of an award (because the educational institution is a new recipient or the parties cannot reach agreement on a rate), the provisional rate used at the time of the award must be adjusted once a rate is negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, the administrative costs charged to Federal awards awarded or amended (including continuation and renewal awards) with effective dates beginning on or after the start of the institution's first fiscal year which begins on or after October 1, 1991, must be limited to 26% of modified total direct costs (as defined in subsection 2) for the total of General Administration and General Expenses, Departmental Administration, Sponsored Projects Administration, and Student Administration and Services (including their allocable share of depreciation, interest costs, operation and maintenance expenses, and fringe benefits costs, as provided by Section B, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of facilities in Section B.

b. Institutions should not change their accounting or cost allocation methods if the effect is to change the charging of a particular type of cost from F&A to direct, or to reclassify costs, or increase allocations from the administrative pools identified in paragraph B.1 of this Appendix to the other F&A cost pools or fringe benefits. Cognizant agencies for indirect cost are authorized to allow changes where an institution's charging practices are at variance with acceptable practices followed by a substantial majority of other institutions.

a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, an institution may elect to claim a fixed allowance for the "Administration" portion of indirect (F&A) costs. The allowance could be either 24% of modified total direct costs or a percentage equal to 95% of the most recently negotiated fixed or predetermined rate for the cost pools included under "Administration" as defined in Section B.1, whichever is less. Under this alternative, no cost proposal need be prepared for the "Administration" portion of the indirect (F&A) cost rate nor is further identification or documentation of these costs required (see subsection c). Where a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost agreement includes this alternative, an institution must make no further charges for the expenditure categories described in Section B.5, Section B.6, Section B.7, and Section B.9.

b. In negotiations of rates for subsequent periods, an institution that has elected the option of subsection a may continue to exercise it at the same rate without further identification or documentation of costs.

c. If an institution elects to accept a threshold rate as defined in subsection a of this section, it is not required to perform a detailed analysis of its administrative costs. However, in order to compute the facilities components of its indirect (F&A) cost rate, the institution must reconcile its indirect (F&A) cost proposal to its financial statements and make appropriate adjustments and reclassifications to identify the costs of each major function as defined in Section A.1, as well as to identify and allocate the facilities components. Administrative costs that are not identified as such by the institution's accounting system (such as those incurred in academic departments) will be classified as instructional costs for purposes of reconciling indirect (F&A) cost proposals to financial statements and allocating facilities costs.

In order to provide mutually agreed-upon information for management purposes, each indirect (F&A) cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each indirect (F&A) cost pool as well as the overall indirect (F&A) cost rate.

a. Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in Subpart A.

(1) Cost negotiation cognizance is assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provides more funds directly to the educational institution for the most recent three years. Information on funding must be derived from relevant data gathered by the National Science Foundation. In cases where neither HHS nor DOD provides Federal funding directly to an educational institution, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment must default to HHS. Notwithstanding the method for cognizance determination described in this section, other arrangements for cognizance of a particular educational institution may also be based in part on the types of research performed at the educational institution and must be decided based on mutual agreement between HHS and DOD. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see § 200.332.

(2) After cognizance is established, it must continue for a five-year period.

b. Acceptance of rates. See § 200.414.

c. Correcting deficiencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate changes needed to correct systems deficiencies relating to accountability for Federal awards. Cognizant agencies for indirect costs must address the concerns of other affected agencies, as appropriate, and must negotiate special rates for Federal agencies that are required to limit recovery of indirect costs by statute.

d. Resolving questioned costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal Government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.

e. Reimbursement. Reimbursement to cognizant agencies for indirect costs for work performed under this Part may be made by reimbursement billing under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.

f. Procedure for establishing facilities and administrative rates must be established by one of the following methods:

(1) Formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs is responsible for negotiating and approving rates for an educational institution on behalf of all Federal agencies. Federal awarding agencies that do not have cognizance for indirect costs must notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs of specific concerns (i.e., a need to establish special cost rates) which could affect the negotiation process. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must address the concerns of all interested agencies, as appropriate. A pre-negotiation conference may be scheduled among all interested agencies, if necessary. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must then arrange a negotiation conference with the educational institution.

(2) Other than formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs and educational institution may reach an agreement on rates without a formal negotiation conference; for example, through correspondence or use of the simplified method described in this section D of this Appendix.

g. Formalizing determinations and agreements. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must formalize all determinations or agreements reached with an educational institution and provide copies to other agencies having an interest. Determinations should include a description of any adjustments, the actual amount, both dollar and percentage adjusted, and the reason for making adjustments.

h. Disputes and disagreements. Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs is unable to reach agreement with an educational institution with regard to rates or audit resolution, the appeal system of the cognizant agency for indirect costs must be followed for resolution of the disagreement.

For facilities and administrative (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals, educational institutions must use the standard format, shown in section E of this appendix, to submit their indirect (F&A) rate proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may, on an institution-by-institution basis, grant exceptions from all or portions of Part II of the standard format requirement. This requirement does not apply to educational institutions that use the simplified method for calculating indirect (F&A) rates, as described in Section D of this Appendix.

As provided in section C.10 of this appendix, each F&A cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each F&A cost pool as well as the overall F&A rate.

a. Where the total direct cost of work covered by this Part at an institution does not exceed $10 million in a fiscal year, the simplified procedure described in subsections 2 or 3 may be used in determining allowable indirect (F&A) costs. Under this simplified procedure, the institution's most recent annual financial report and immediately available supporting information must be utilized as a basis for determining the indirect (F&A) cost rate applicable to all Federal awards. The institution may use either the salaries and wages (see subsection 2) or modified total direct costs (see subsection 3) as the distribution basis.

b. The simplified procedure should not be used where it produces results which appear inequitable to the Federal Government or the institution. In any such case, indirect (F&A) costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure.

a. Establish the total amount of salaries and wages paid to all employees of the institution.

b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the following titles or their equivalents:

(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships).

(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other institutional activities).

(3) Library.

(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments.

In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. The total amount of salaries and wages included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool must be separately identified.

c. Establish a salary and wage distribution base, determined by deducting from the total of salaries and wages as established in subsection a from the amount of salaries and wages included under subsection b.

d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c.

e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to direct salaries and wages for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements.

a. Establish the total costs incurred by the institution for the base period.

b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the following titles or their equivalents:

(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships).

(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other institutional activities).

(3) Library.

(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments. In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. The modified total direct costs amount included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool must be separately identified.

c. Establish a modified total direct cost distribution base, as defined in Section C.2, The distribution basis, that consists of all institution's direct functions.

d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c.

e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to the modified total direct costs for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements.

The standard format for documentation requirements for indirect (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals for claiming costs under the regular method is available on the OMB website.

To assure that expenditures for Federal awards are proper and in accordance with the agreement documents and approved project budgets, the annual and/or final fiscal reports or vouchers requesting payment under the agreements will include a certification, signed by an authorized official of the university, which reads "By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and intent set forth in the award documents. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3733 and 3801-3812)".

###### Policy.

a.Cognizant agencies must not accept a proposed indirect cost rate unless such costs have been certified by the educational institution using the Certificate of indirect (F&A) Costs set forth in subsection F.2.c

b. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the institution by the chief financial officer or an individual designated by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer.

An indirect (F&A) cost rate is not binding upon the Federal Government if the most recent required proposal from the institution has not been certified. Where it is necessary to establish indirect (F&A) cost rates, and the institution has not submitted a certified proposal for establishing such rates in accordance with the requirements of this section, the Federal Government must unilaterally establish such rates. Such rates may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When indirect (F&A) cost rates are unilaterally established by the Federal Government because of failure of the institution to submit a certified proposal for establishing such rates in accordance with this section, the rates established will be set at a level low enough to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.

###### Certificate.

c.The certificate required by this section must be in the following form:

This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:

(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith;

(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal agreement(s) to which they apply and with the cost principles applicable to those agreements.

(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable under subpart E of this part such as (without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and

(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal agreements on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.

I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

##### Appendix IV to Part 200 - Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations

1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective. Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as indirect costs under the conditions described in § 200.413(d). After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to awards or other work as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitting cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.

2. "Major nonprofit organizations" are defined in paragraph (a) of § 200.414. See indirect cost rate reporting requirements in sections B.2.e and B.3.g of this Appendix.

a. If a nonprofit organization has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures, as described in section B.2 of this Appendix.

b. If an organization has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).

c. The determination of what constitutes an organization's major functions will depend on its purpose in being; the types of services it renders to the public, its clients, and its members; and the amount of effort it devotes to such activities as fundraising, public information and membership activities.

d. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in section B.2 through B.5 of this Appendix.

e. The base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the organization's fiscal year but, in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of the costs.

a. Where an organization's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (i) separating the organization's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (ii) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where an organization has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to an organization is relatively small.

b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs which represent activities must be included in the direct costs under the conditions described in § 200.413(e).

c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as subawards for $25,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must exclude participant support costs as defined in § 200.1.

d. Except where a special rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the indirect cost rate developed under the above principles is applicable to all Federal awards of the organization. If a special rate(s) is required, appropriate modifications must be made in order to develop the special rate(s).

###### i.e.,

e. For an organization that receives more than $10 million in direct Federal funding in a fiscal year, a breakout of the indirect cost component into two broad categories, Facilities and Administration as defined in paragraph (a) of § 200.414, is required. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost category (Facilities or Administration) is of the distribution base identified with that category.

a. General. Where an organization's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings, as described in subparagraph b. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits. The default allocation bases by cost pool are described in section B.3.c of this Appendix.

b. Identification of indirect costs. Cost groupings must be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping must constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The groupings are classified within the two broad categories: "Facilities" and "Administration," as described in section A.3 of this Appendix. The indirect cost pools are defined as follows:

(1) Depreciation. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the organization's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 200.436.

(2) Interest. Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements are computed in accordance with § 200.449.

(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the organization's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expenses category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.

(4) General administration and general expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the overall general executive and administrative offices of the organization and other expenses of a general nature which do not relate solely to any major function of the organization. This category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of this category include central offices, such as the director's office, the office of finance, business services, budget and planning, personnel, safety and risk management, general counsel, management information systems, and library costs.

In developing this cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, project supplies, project publication, telephone toll charges, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized services costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular program. The salaries and wages of administrative and pooled clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate as described in § 200.413. Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, periodicals and memberships should normally be treated as indirect costs.

c. Allocation bases. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitting functions. The essential consideration in selecting a method or a base is that it is the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; a traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and reason, where neither the cause nor the effect of the relationship is determinable. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the allocation must be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the organization. The distribution must be made in accordance with the bases described herein unless it can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards. The results of special cost studies (such as an engineering utility study) must not be used to determine and allocate the indirect costs to Federal awards.

(1) Depreciation. Depreciation expenses must be allocated in the following manner:

(a) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.

(b) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas, such as hallways, stairwells, and restrooms.

(c) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related space (e.g., individual rooms, and laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to the benefitting functions on the basis of:

(i) the employees and other users on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or

(ii) organization-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting functions of the organization.

(d) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories on a FTE basis and distributed to major functions in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to the functions.

(2) Interest. Interest costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital equipment to which the interest relates.

(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation.

(4) General administration and general expenses. General administration and general expenses must be allocated to benefitting functions based on modified total costs (MTC). The MTC is the modified total direct costs (MTDC), as described in § 200.1, plus the allocated indirect cost proportion. The expenses included in this category could be grouped first according to major functions of the organization to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to benefitting functions based on MTC.

d. Order of distribution.

(1) Indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration and general expenses must be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect cost categories as well as to the major functions of the organization. Other cost categories should be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the organization. This order of allocation does not apply if cross allocation of costs is made as provided in section B.3.d.2 of this Appendix.

(2) Normally, an indirect cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs must not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect costs categories could be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect cost categories is required.

e. Application of indirect cost rate or rates. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.

f. Distribution basis. Indirect costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function on the basis of MTDC (see definition in § 200.1).

g. Individual Rate Components. An indirect cost rate must be determined for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of the distribution base identified with that pool. Each indirect cost rate negotiation or determination agreement must include development of the rate for each indirect cost pool as well as the overall indirect cost rate. The indirect cost pools must be classified within two broad categories: "Facilities" and "Administration," as described in § 200.414(a).

a. Some nonprofit organizations treat all costs as direct costs except general administration and general expenses. These organizations generally separate their costs into three basic categories: (i) General administration and general expenses, (ii) fundraising, and (iii) other direct functions (including projects performed under Federal awards). Joint costs, such as depreciation, rental costs, operation and maintenance of facilities, telephone expenses, and the like are prorated individually as direct costs to each category and to each Federal award or other activity using a base most appropriate to the particular cost being prorated.

b. This method is acceptable, provided each joint cost is prorated using a base which accurately measures the benefits provided to each Federal award or other activity. The bases must be established in accordance with reasonable criteria and be supported by current data. This method is compatible with the Standards of Accounting and Financial Reporting for Voluntary Health and Welfare Organizations issued jointly by the National Health Council, Inc., the National Assembly of Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations, and the United Way of America.

c. Under this method, indirect costs consist exclusively of general administration and general expenses. In all other respects, the organization's indirect cost rates must be computed in the same manner as that described in section B.2 of this Appendix.

In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of an organization or for each major function of the organization may not be appropriate, since it would not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of work. For this purpose, a particular segment of work may be that performed under a single Federal award or it may consist of work under a group of Federal awards performed in a common environment. These factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular segment of work is performed in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided it is determined that (i) the rate differs significantly from that which would have been obtained under sections B.2, B.3, and B.4 of this Appendix, and (ii) the volume of work to which the rate would apply is material.

As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section:

###### Cognizant agency for indirect costs

a.means the Federal agency responsible for negotiating and approving indirect cost rates for a nonprofit organization on behalf of all Federal agencies.

###### Predetermined rate

b.means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the organization's fiscal year. The rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. A predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment.

###### Fixed rate

c.means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.

###### Final rate

d.means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual costs of the period. A final rate is not subject to adjustment.

###### Provisional rate or billing rate

e.means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a final rate for the period.

###### Indirect cost proposal

f.means the documentation prepared by an organization to substantiate its claim for the reimbursement of indirect costs. This proposal provides the basis for the review and negotiation leading to the establishment of an organization's indirect cost rate.

###### Cost objective

g.means a function, organizational subdivision, contract, Federal award, or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, projects, jobs and capitalized projects.

a. Unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned, the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of Federal awards directly funded to an organization will be designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs for the negotiation and approval of the indirect cost rates and, where necessary, other rates such as fringe benefit and computer charge-out rates. Once an agency is assigned cognizance for a particular nonprofit organization, the assignment will not be changed unless there is a shift in the dollar volume of the Federal awards directly funded to the organization for at least three years. All concerned Federal agencies must be given the opportunity to participate in the negotiation process but, after a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted by all Federal agencies. When a Federal agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, it will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs. (See also § 200.414.) If the nonprofit does not receive any funding from any Federal agency, the pass-through entity is responsible for the negotiation of the indirect cost rates in accordance with § 200.332(a)(4).

b. Except as otherwise provided in § 200.414(f), a nonprofit organization which has not previously established an indirect cost rate with a Federal agency must submit its initial indirect cost proposal immediately after the organization is advised that a Federal award will be made and, in no event, later than three months after the effective date of the Federal award.

c. Unless approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.414(g), organizations that have previously established indirect cost rates must submit a new indirect cost proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months after the close of each fiscal year.

d. A predetermined rate may be negotiated for use on Federal awards where there is reasonable assurance, based on past experience and reliable projection of the organization's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on the organization's actual costs.

e. Fixed rates may be negotiated where predetermined rates are not considered appropriate. A fixed rate, however, must not be negotiated if (i) all or a substantial portion of the organization's Federal awards are expected to expire before the carry-forward adjustment can be made; (ii) the mix of Federal and non-Federal work at the organization is too erratic to permit an equitable carry-forward adjustment; or (iii) the organization's operations fluctuate significantly from year to year.

f. Provisional and final rates must be negotiated where neither predetermined nor fixed rates are appropriate. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the organization's fiscal year. If that event does not occur, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.

g. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must make available copies of the agreement to all concerned Federal agencies.

h. If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

i. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance as required to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

(1) Required Certification. No proposal to establish indirect (F&A) cost rates must be acceptable unless such costs have been certified by the nonprofit organization using the Certificate of Indirect (F&A) Costs set forth in section j. of this appendix. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the organization by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer for the organization.

(2) Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:

This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:

(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith;

(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal awards to which they apply and with subpart E of this part.

(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable under subpart E of this part such as (without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and

(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.

I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

##### Appendix V to Part 200 - State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans

1. Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since federally-supported awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process. All costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards.

###### A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government."

2. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled "A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website.

###### Agency or operating agency

1.means an organizational unit or sub-division within a governmental unit that is responsible for the performance or administration of Federal awards or activities of the governmental unit.

###### Allocated central services

2.means central services that benefit operating agencies but are not billed to the agencies on a fee-for-service or similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefitted agencies on some reasonable basis. Examples of such services might include general accounting, personnel administration, purchasing, etc.

###### Billed central services

3.means central services that are billed to benefitted agencies or programs on an individual fee-for-service or similar basis. Typical examples of billed central services include computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringe benefits.

###### Cognizant agency for indirect costs

4.is defined in § 200.1. The determination of cognizant agency for indirect costs for states and local governments is described in section F.1.

###### Major local government

5.means local government that receives more than $100 million in direct Federal awards subject to this Part.

The central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) under Federal awards and will be documented as described in section E. omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed.

1. Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awards. The plan should include (a) a projection of the next year's allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.

2. Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.

3. All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. These local governments are not required to submit their plans for Federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a local government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for monitoring the subrecipient's plan.

4. All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six months prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's fiscal years in which it proposes to claim central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.

The documentation requirements described in this section may be modified, expanded, or reduced by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the requirements may be reduced for those central services which have little or no impact on Federal awards. Conversely, if a review of a plan indicates that certain additional information is needed, and will likely be needed in future years, it may be routinely requested in future plan submissions. Items marked with an asterisk (*) should be submitted only once; subsequent plans should merely indicate any changes since the last plan.

All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: an organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the state/local government whether or not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions; a copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan; and, a certification (see subsection 4.) that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Part, contains only allowable costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awards/activities.

For each allocated central service*, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of the service, an identification of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving the service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the method used to distribute the cost of the service to benefitted agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of each service to the specific benefitted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe benefits costs are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services, documentation discussed in subsections 3.b. and c. must also be included.

###### General.

a.The information described in this section must be provided for all billed central services, including internal service funds, self-insurance funds, and fringe benefit funds.

b. Internal service funds.

###### e.g.,

(1) For each internal service fund or similar activity with an operating budget of $5 million or more, the plan must include: A brief description of each service; a balance sheet for each fund based on individual accounts contained in the governmental unit's accounting system; a revenue/expenses statement, with revenues broken out by source,regular billings, interest earned, etc.; a listing of all non-operating transfers (as defined by GAAP) into and out of the fund; a description of the procedures (methodology) used to charge the costs of each service to users, including how billing rates are determined; a schedule of current rates; and, a schedule comparing total revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service to the allowable costs of the service, as determined under this part, with an explanation of how variances will be handled.

(2) Revenues must consist of all revenues generated by the service, including unbilled and uncollected revenues. If some users were not billed for the services (or were not billed at the full rate for that class of users), a schedule showing the full imputed revenues associated with these users must be provided. Expenses must be broken out by object cost categories (e.g., salaries, supplies, etc.).

###### Self-insurance funds.

c.For each self-insurance fund, the plan must include: the fund balance sheet; a statement of revenue and expenses including a summary of billings and claims paid by agency; a listing of all non-operating transfers into and out of the fund; the type(s) of risk(s) covered by the fund (e.g., automobile liability, workers' compensation, etc.); an explanation of how the level of fund contributions are determined, including a copy of the current actuarial report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if the contributions are determined on an actuarial basis; and, a description of the procedures used to charge or allocate fund contributions to benefitted activities. Reserve levels in excess of claims (1) submitted and adjudicated but not paid, (2) submitted but not adjudicated, and (3) incurred but not submitted must be identified and explained.

###### Fringe benefits.

d.For fringe benefit costs, the plan must include: a listing of fringe benefits provided to covered employees, and the overall annual cost of each type of benefit; current fringe benefit policies; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the benefits to benefitted activities. In addition, for pension and post-retirement health insurance plans, the following information must be provided: the governmental unit's funding policies, e.g., legislative bills, trust agreements, or state-mandated contribution rules, if different from actuarially determined rates; the pension plan's costs accrued for the year; the amount funded, and date(s) of funding; a copy of the current actuarial report (including the actuarial assumptions); the plan trustee's report; and, a schedule from the activity showing the value of the interest cost associated with late funding.

Each central service cost allocation plan will be accompanied by a certification in the following form:

This is to certify that I have reviewed the cost allocation plan submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:

(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish cost allocations or billings for [identify period covered by plan] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of this Part and the Federal award(s) to which they apply. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the cost allocation plan.

(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently.

In general, unless different arrangements are agreed to by the concerned Federal agencies, for central service cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency responsible for review and approval is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of total Federal awards with a governmental unit. For indirect cost rates and departmental indirect cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of direct Federal awards with a governmental unit or component, as appropriate. Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the Federal agency must remain so for a period of five years. In addition, the following Federal agencies continue to be responsible for the indicated governmental entities:

###### Department of Health and Human Services

-Public assistance and state-wide cost allocation plans for all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), state and local hospitals, libraries and health districts.

###### Department of the Interior

-Indian tribal governments, territorial governments, and state and local park and recreational districts.

###### Department of Labor

-State and local labor departments.

###### Department of Education

-School districts and state and local education agencies.

###### Department of Agriculture

-State and local agriculture departments.

###### Department of Transportation

-State and local airport and port authorities and transit districts.

###### Department of Commerce

-State and local economic development districts.

###### Department of Housing and Urban Development

-State and local housing and development districts.

###### Environmental Protection Agency

-State and local water and sewer districts.

All proposed central service cost allocation plans that are required to be submitted will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a timely basis. The cognizant agency for indirect costs will review the proposal within six months of receipt of the proposal and either negotiate/approve the proposal or advise the governmental unit of the additional documentation needed to support/evaluate the proposed plan or the changes required to make the proposal acceptable. Once an agreement with the governmental unit has been reached, the agreement will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies, unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special consideration, the funding agency will, prior to the time the plans are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The results of the negotiation must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.

Negotiated cost allocation plans based on a proposal later found to have included costs that: (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in subpart F, General Provisions for selected Items of Cost of this Part, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards, must be adjusted, or a refund must be made at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations. Adjustments or cash refunds may include, at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. These adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the plans and do not constitute a reopening of the negotiation.

Each billed central service activity must separately account for all revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service, expenses incurred to furnish the service, and profit/loss.

Internal service funds are dependent upon a reasonable level of working capital reserve to operate from one billing cycle to the next. Charges by an internal service activity to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable level of working capital reserve, in addition to the full recovery of costs, are allowable. A working capital reserve as part of retained earnings of up to 60 calendar days cash expenses for normal operating purposes is considered reasonable. A working capital reserve exceeding 60 calendar days may be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in exceptional cases.

Allocated central service costs are usually negotiated and approved for a future fiscal year on a "fixed with carry-forward" basis. Under this procedure, the fixed amounts for the future year covered by agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year. However, when the actual costs of the year involved become known, the differences between the fixed amounts previously approved and the actual costs will be carried forward and used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts established for a later year. This "carry-forward" procedure applies to all central services whose costs were fixed in the approved plan. However, a carry-forward adjustment is not permitted, for a central service activity that was not included in the approved plan, or for unallowable costs that must be reimbursed immediately.

Billing rates used to charge Federal awards must be based on the estimated costs of providing the services, including an estimate of the allocable central service costs. A comparison of the revenue generated by each billed service (including total revenues whether or not billed or collected) to the actual allowable costs of the service will be made at least annually, and an adjustment will be made for the difference between the revenue and the allowable costs. These adjustments will be made through one of the following adjustment methods: (a) a cash refund including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations to the Federal Government for the Federal share of the adjustment, (b) credits to the amounts charged to the individual programs, (c) adjustments to future billing rates, or (d) adjustments to allocated central service costs. Adjustments to allocated central services will not be permitted where the total amount of the adjustment for a particular service (Federal share and non-Federal) share exceeds $500,000. Adjustment methods may include, at the option of the cognizant agency, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations.

All central service cost allocation plans and related documentation used as a basis for claiming costs under Federal awards must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in subpart D of this part.

If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

##### Appendix VI to Part 200 - Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans

Federally-financed programs administered by state public assistance agencies are funded predominately by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In support of its stewardship requirements, HHS has published requirements for the development, documentation, submission, negotiation, and approval of public assistance cost allocation plans in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. All administrative costs (direct and indirect) are normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the public assistance cost allocation plan. This Appendix extends these requirements to all Federal awarding agencies whose programs are administered by a state public assistance agency. Major federally-financed programs typically administered by state public assistance agencies include: Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistance and Foster Care, and Social Services Block Grant.

###### State public assistance agency

1.means a state agency administering or supervising the administration of one or more public assistance programs operated by the state as identified in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. For the purpose of this Appendix, these programs include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency.

###### State public assistance agency costs

2.means all costs incurred by, or allocable to, the state public assistance agency, except expenditures for financial assistance, medical contractor payments, food stamps, and payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients.

State public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. The remaining sections of this Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarize the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95.

1. State public assistance agencies are required to promptly submit amendments to the cost allocation plan to HHS for review and approval.

2. Under the coordination process outlined in section E, affected Federal agencies will review all new plans and plan amendments and provide comments, as appropriate, to HHS. The effective date of the plan or plan amendment will be the first day of the calendar quarter following the event that required the amendment, unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS, as the cognizant agency for indirect costs acting on behalf of all affected Federal agencies, will, as necessary, conduct negotiations with the state public assistance agency and will inform the state agency of the action taken on the plan or plan amendment.

1. Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative nature, the review during the plan approval process consists of evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs (cost centers) and the related allocation bases. As such, the Federal Government needs some assurance that the cost allocation plan has been implemented as approved. This is accomplished by reviews by the Federal awarding agencies, single audits, or audits conducted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

2. Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one Federal awarding agency are identified, the cognizant HHS cost negotiation office will be advised and will take the lead in resolving the issue(s) as provided for in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95.

3. If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a disallowance involving two or more Federal awarding agencies, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures set out in 45 CFR Part 16. Disputes involving only one Federal awarding agency will be resolved in accordance with the Federal awarding agency's appeal process.

4. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal awarding agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, the Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

Claims developed under approved cost allocation plans will be based on allowable costs as identified in this Part. Where unallowable costs have been claimed and reimbursed, they will be refunded to the program that reimbursed the unallowable cost using one of the following methods: (a) a cash refund, (b) offset to a subsequent claim, or (c) credits to the amounts charged to individual Federal awards. Cash refunds, offsets, and credits may include at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect cost, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency for indirect cost claims collection regulations.

##### Appendix VII to Part 200 - States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals

1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint purposes. These costs benefit more than one cost objective and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to Federal awards and other activities as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitted cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.

2. Indirect costs include (a) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards and (b) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan (as described in Appendix V to this part) and not otherwise treated as direct costs.

###### A Guide for States and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government."

3. Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use of an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) is usually necessary for each department or agency of the governmental unit claiming indirect costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of indirect cost proposals are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled "A copy of this brochure may be obtained from HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website.

4. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of governmental units, the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs cannot be specified in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs may include certain state/local-wide central service costs, general administration of the non-Federal entity accounting and personnel services performed within the non-Federal entity, depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities.

5. This Appendix does not apply to state public assistance agencies. These agencies should refer instead to Appendix VI to this part.

###### Base

1.means the accumulated direct costs (normally either total direct salaries and wages or total direct costs exclusive of any extraordinary or distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The direct cost base selected should result in each Federal award bearing a fair share of the indirect costs in reasonable relation to the benefits received from the costs.

###### Base period

2.for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to activities performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the governmental unit's fiscal year, but in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of costs.

###### Cognizant agency for indirect costs

3.means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing and approving the governmental unit's indirect cost rate(s) on the behalf of the Federal Government. The cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment is described in Appendix V, section F.

###### Final rate

4.means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual allowable costs of the period. A final audited rate is not subject to adjustment.

###### Fixed rate

5.means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual, allowable costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.

###### Indirect cost pool

6.is the accumulated costs that jointly benefit two or more programs or other cost objectives.

###### Indirect cost rate

7.is a device for determining in a reasonable manner the proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a direct cost base.

###### Indirect cost rate proposal

8.means the documentation prepared by a governmental unit or subdivision thereof to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate.

###### Predetermined rate

9.means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit's fiscal year. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment. (Because of legal constraints, predetermined rates are not permitted for Federal contracts; they may, however, be used for grants or cooperative agreements.) Predetermined rates may not be used by governmental units that have not submitted and negotiated the rate with the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect costs during the ensuing accounting periods.

###### Provisional rate

10.means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a "final" rate for that period.

a. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from the indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures as described in subsection 2.

b. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, the allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).

c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in subsections 2, 3 and 4.

a. Where a non-Federal entity's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (1) classifying the non-Federal entity's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (2) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to that department or agency is relatively small.

b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs must be included in the direct costs if they represent activities to which indirect costs are properly allocable.

c. The distribution base may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as pass-through funds, subcontracts in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution.

a. Where a non-Federal entity's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, such costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits.

b. The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping should constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The number of separate groupings should be held within practical limits, taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision needed.

c. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitted functions. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a grouping are more general in nature, the allocation should be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the governmental unit. In general, any cost element or related factor associated with the governmental unit's activities is potentially adaptable for use as an allocation base provided that: (1) it can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative measures (total direct costs, direct salaries and wages, staff hours applied, square feet used, hours of usage, number of documents processed, population served, and the like), and (2) it is common to the benefitted functions during the base period.

d. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.

e. The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate for each function may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items such as pass-through funds, subawards in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution. An indirect cost rate should be developed for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage relationship between the particular indirect cost pool and the distribution base identified with that pool.

a. In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of a non-Federal entity or for each major function of the agency may not be appropriate. It may not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular program or group of programs. The factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular Federal award is carried out in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to that Federal award. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided that: (1) The rate differs significantly from the rate which would have been developed under paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this Appendix, and (2) the Federal award to which the rate would apply is material in amount.

b. Where Federal statutes restrict the reimbursement of certain indirect costs, it may be necessary to develop a special rate for the affected Federal award. Where a "restricted rate" is required, the same procedure for developing a non-restricted rate will be used except for the additional step of the elimination from the indirect cost pool those costs for which the law prohibits reimbursement.

a. All departments or agencies of the governmental unit desiring to claim indirect costs under Federal awards must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and related documentation to support those costs. The proposal and related documentation must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in § 200.334.

b. A governmental department or agency unit that receives more than $35 million in direct Federal funding must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs. Other governmental department or agency must develop an indirect cost proposal in accordance with the requirements of this Part and maintain the proposal and related supporting documentation for audit. These governmental departments or agencies are not required to submit their proposals unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for negotiating and/or monitoring the subrecipient's indirect costs.

c. Each Indian tribal government desiring reimbursement of indirect costs must submit its indirect cost proposal to the Department of the Interior (its cognizant agency for indirect costs).

d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required, submitted) within six months after the close of the governmental unit's fiscal year, unless an exception is approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If the proposed central service cost allocation plan for the same period has not been approved by that time, the indirect cost proposal may be prepared including an amount for central services that is based on the latest federally-approved central service cost allocation plan. The difference between these central service amounts and the amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for by an adjustment in a subsequent period.

The following must be included with each indirect cost proposal:

a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary work sheets and other relevant data, cross referenced and reconciled to the financial data noted in subsection b. Allocated central service costs will be supported by the summary table included in the approved central service cost allocation plan. This summary table is not required to be submitted with the indirect cost proposal if the central service cost allocation plan for the same fiscal year has been approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs and is available to the funding agency.

b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, comprehensive annual financial report, executive budgets, accounting reports, etc.) upon which the rate is based. Adjustments resulting from the use of unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs in a subsequent proposal.

c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under Federal awards. These costs should be broken out between salaries and wages and other direct costs.

d. A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during the period for which the proposal applies, along with a functional statement(s) noting the duties and/or responsibilities of all units that comprise the agency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be submitted with subsequent proposals.)

Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:

This is to certify that I have reviewed the indirect cost rate proposal submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:

(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect costs rates for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal award(s) to which they apply and the provisions of this Part. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the indirect cost proposal

(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently and the Federal Government will be notified of any accounting changes that would affect the predetermined rate.

1. Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency on a timely basis. Once a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates, the funding agency will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

2. The use of predetermined rates, if allowed, is encouraged where the cognizant agency for indirect costs has reasonable assurance based on past experience and reliable projection of the non-Federal entity's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on actual costs. Long-term agreements utilizing predetermined rates extending over two or more years are encouraged, where appropriate.

3. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute, or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The agreed upon rates must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.

4. Refunds must be made if proposals are later found to have included costs that (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in § 200.420, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards. These adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).

If overall fringe benefit rates are not approved for the governmental unit as part of the central service cost allocation plan, these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for individual recipient agencies during the indirect cost negotiation process. In these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation should accompany the indirect cost proposal. If fringe benefit rates are not used at the recipient agency level (i.e., the agency specifically identifies fringe benefit costs to individual employees), the governmental unit should so advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

In some cases, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit) provide and bill for services similar to those covered by central service cost allocation plans (e.g., computer centers). Where this occurs, the governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit)should be guided by the requirements in Appendix V relating to the development of billing rates and documentation requirements, and should advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs of any billed services. Reviews of these types of services (including reviews of costing/billing methodology, profits or losses, etc.) will be made on a case-by-case basis as warranted by the circumstances involved.

In certain situations, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit), because of the nature of their Federal awards, may be required to develop a cost allocation plan that distributes indirect (and, in some cases, direct) costs to the specific funding sources. In these cases, a narrative cost allocation methodology should be developed, documented, maintained for audit, or submitted, as appropriate, to the cognizant agency for indirect costs for review, negotiation, and approval.

If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other rate) between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

Costs specifically identified as unallowable and charged to Federal awards either directly or indirectly will be refunded (including interest chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations).

To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of this Federal award, then you as the recipient during that period of time must maintain the currency of information reported to the System for Award Management (SAM) that is made available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) about civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings described in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.

Submit the information required about each proceeding that:

a. Is in connection with the award or performance of a grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract from the Federal Government;

b. Reached its final disposition during the most recent five-year period; and

c. Is one of the following:

(1) A criminal proceeding that resulted in a conviction, as defined in paragraph 5 of this award term and condition;

(2) A civil proceeding that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more;

(3) An administrative proceeding, as defined in paragraph 5. of this award term and condition, that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and your payment of either a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more or reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000; or

(4) Any other criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding if:

(i) It could have led to an outcome described in paragraph 2.c.(1), (2), or (3) of this award term and condition;

(ii) It had a different disposition arrived at by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault on your part; and

(iii) The requirement in this award term and condition to disclose information about the proceeding does not conflict with applicable laws and regulations.

Enter in the SAM Entity Management area the information that SAM requires about each proceeding described in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. You do not need to submit the information a second time under assistance awards that you received if you already provided the information through SAM because you were required to do so under Federal procurement contracts that you were awarded.

During any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph 1 of this award term and condition, you must report proceedings information through SAM for the most recent five year period, either to report new information about any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to report. Recipients that have Federal contract, grant, and cooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must disclose semiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings.

For purposes of this award term and condition:

###### e.g.,

a. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.

b. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere.

c. Total value of currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts includes-

(1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share or match; and

(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if not yet exercised.

####### Standards for competition.

(a)Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, awarding agencies shall enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. An awarding agency's competitive award process shall adhere to the following standards:

(1) Potential applicants must be invited to submit proposals through publications such as theOMB-designated governmentwide website as described in 2 CFR 200.204, professional trade journals, agency or program handbooks, the Assistance Listings, or any other appropriate means of solicitation. In so doing, awarding agencies should consider the broadest dissemination of project solicitations in order to reach the highest number of potential applicants.

(2) Proposals are to be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with written criteria set forth by the awarding agency. Reviewers should make written comments, as appropriate, on each application. Independent reviewers may be from the private sector, another agency, or within the awarding agency, as long as they do not include anyone who has approval authority for the applications being reviewed or anyone who might appear to have a conflict of interest in the role of reviewer of applications. A conflict of interest might arise when the reviewer or the reviewer's immediate family members have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial interest in the applicant or applicant organization; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment.

(3) An unsolicited application, which is not unique and innovative, shall be competed under the project solicitation it comes closest to fitting. Awarding agency officials will determine the solicitation under which the application is to be evaluated. When the awarding agency official decides that the unsolicited application does not fall under a recent, current, or planned solicitation, a noncompetitive award may be made, if appropriate to do so under the criteria of this section. Otherwise, the application should be returned to the applicant.

####### Project solicitations.

(b)A project solicitation by the awarding agency shall include or reference the following, as appropriate:

(1) A description of the eligible activities which the awarding agency proposes to support and the program priorities;

(4) Evaluation criteria and weights, if appropriate, assigned to each;

(5) Methods for evaluating and ranking applications;

(6) Name and address where proposals should be mailed or emailed and submission deadline(s);

(7) Any required forms and how to obtain them;

(8) Applicable cost principles and administrative requirements;

(9) Type of funding instrument intended to be used (grant or cooperative agreement); and

(10) The Assistance Listings number and title.

####### Approval of applications.

(c)The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding/approving official in each agency. The awarding/approving official shall consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the independent review group, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the award decision shall be handled by the awarding agency using existing agency appeal procedures or good administrative practice and sound business judgment.

####### Exceptions.

(d)The awarding/approving official may make a determination in writing that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination shall be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of the program. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

(1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services;

(2) Awards of less than $75,000;

(3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award;

However, prospective contractors may provide States with specification information related to a State procurement under the USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) and still compete for the procurement if the State, and not the prospective contractor, develops or drafts the specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bid, and/or requests for proposals used to conduct the procurement.

(b) Procurements by States under USDA entitlement programs specified in 2 CFR 200.101(f)(4) through (6) shall be conducted in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographic preferences except as provided for in 2 CFR 200.319(c).

(1) An entitlement or mandatory award required by a statute, including a lower tier entitlement or mandatory award that is required by a statute.

####### et seq.,See

(2) The export or substitution of Federal timber governed by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620(The "Export Act"), which prevents a debarred person from entering into any contract for the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands.16 U.S.C. 620d(d)(1)(A).

####### Limited requirement to check EPLS.

(b)Notwithstanding the fact that transactions to be implemented outside the United States that are below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program, export credit guarantee program or direct credit program are not covered transactions, pursuant to paragraphs (a)(8) and (9) of this section, primary tier participants under these programs must check the EPLS prior to entering into any transaction with a person at the first lower tier and shall not enter into such a transaction if the person is excluded or disqualified under the EPLS.

####### Exception.

(c)A cause for suspension or debarment under § 180.700 or § 180.800 of this title (as supplemented by § 417.800) may be based on the actions of a person with respect to a procurement or nonprocurement transaction under a USDA program even if such transaction has been excluded from covered transaction status by this section or § 417.220.

###### § 417.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part:

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

####### see

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (appendix to this part).

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 417.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of a USDA official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

(c) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA export credit guarantee program or direct credit program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(e) Notwithstanding the fact that procurement contracts to be implemented outside the United States that are below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program, export credit guarantee program or direct credit program are not covered transactions, pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, primary tier participants under these programs must check the EPLS prior to entering into any procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with a person at the first lower tier and shall not enter into such a procurement contract if the person is excluded or disqualified under the EPLS.

###### § 417.221 How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's foreign assistance programs apply?

The primary tier covered transaction would be the food aid grant agreement entered into between USDA and a program participant, such as a U.S. private voluntary organization. USDA would have to check the EPLS before entering into the food aid grant agreement to ensure that the U.S. private voluntary organization that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a subrecipient agreement between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign subrecipient of the commodities that were provided under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(8), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract entered into between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign entity to provide supplies or services that are expected to equal or exceed $25,000 in value and that are needed by such organization to implement activities under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. private voluntary organization would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with a subrecipient or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

###### § 417.222 How would the exclusions from coverage for USDA's export credit guarantee and direct credit programs apply?

####### Export credit guarantee program.,i.e.,

(a)In the case of the export credit guarantee program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the guarantee issued by the USDA to a U.S. exporter. The U.S. exporter usually assigns the guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, and this would create another primary tier covered transaction between USDA and the U.S. financial institution. USDA would have to check the EPLS before issuing a guarantee or accepting a guarantee assignment to ensure that the U.S. exporter or financial institution that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank to the U.S. exporter to pay on behalf of the importer for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the guarantee. Similarly, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank under an instrument, such as a loan agreement or letter of credit, to the U.S. financial institution assigned the guarantee, which has paid the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities and, in so doing, issued a loan to the foreign bank, which the foreign bank is obligated to repay on deferred payment terms. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), these nonprocurement transactions would not be covered transactions. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a procurement contract (a contract for the purchase and sale of goods) that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the guarantee. Pursuant to § 417.220(d), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. exporter or U.S. financial institution would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or foreign bank or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

####### Direct credit program.

(b)In the case of the direct credit program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the financing agreement between the USDA and the U.S. exporter. USDA purchases the exporter's account receivable in a particular transaction pursuant to the financing agreement. On occasion, such transaction may contemplate a payment obligation of a U.S. or foreign bank to make the required payments. USDA would have to check the EPLS before entering into a financing agreement or accepting such a payor to ensure that the U.S. exporter or the bank, if any, that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of the importer to pay the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(d), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(e), the U.S. exporter would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or bank, or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the EPLS as excluded or disqualified.

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

###### § 417.332 What methods must I use to pass down requirements to participants in lower tier covered transactions with whom I intend to do business?

You as a participant must include a term or condition in lower tier covered transactions requiring lower tier participants to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part.

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of Department of Agriculture Officials Regarding Transactions

###### § 417.437 What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower tier covered transactions.

##### Subpart E - System for Award Management Exclusions

###### § 417.500 What is the purpose of the System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions)?

(b)(1) The database for SAM Exclusions includes a field for the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.

(2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

###### § 417.520 Who places the information into SAM Exclusions?

Federal agency officials who take actions to exclude persons under this part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified persons must enter the following information about those persons into SAM Exclusions:

(a) Information required by § 180.515(a) of this title;

###### § 417.625 What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

(a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited-

(1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or

(2) To specific types of transactions.

(b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official-

Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

###### § 417.635 May a Federal agency settle a debarment or suspension action?

Yes, a Federal agency may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

###### § 417.640 May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

Yes, if a Federal agency enters into a settlement with you in which you agree to be excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide effect.

##### Subpart B - Activities by Own Employees

###### § 418.200 Agency and legislative liaison.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

###### § 418.205 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, "professional and technical services" shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

###### § 418.210 Reporting.

No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

##### Subpart C - Activities by Other Than Own Employees

###### § 418.300 Professional and technical services.

(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

(b) The reporting requirements in § 418.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, "professional and technical services" shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

##### Subpart D - Penalties and Enforcement

###### § 418.400 Penalties.

(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

###### § 418.405 Penalty procedures.

Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C.s 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

###### § 418.410 Enforcement.

The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.

##### Subpart E - Exemptions

###### § 418.500 Secretary of Defense.

(a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest.

OMB shall provide detailed specifications in a memorandum to these agencies.

(g) Non-major agencies are requested to provide machine-readable compilations to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

(h) Agencies shall keep the originals of all disclosure reports in the official files of the agency.

(4) Developing Memoranda of Understanding with agencies that elect not to develop their own research misconduct procedures;

(5) Monitoring the progress of all research misconduct cases; and

(6) Serving as liaison with OIG to receive allegations of research misconduct when they are received via the OIG Hotline.

##### § 422.2 Procedures.

Research institutions that conduct extramural research funded by USDA must foster an atmosphere conducive to research integrity. They must develop or have procedures in place to respond to allegations of research misconduct that ensure:

(a) Appropriate separations of responsibility for inquiry, investigation, and adjudication;

(b) Objectivity;

(c) Due process;

(d) Whistleblower protection;

(e) Confidentiality. To the extent possible and consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subjects and informants is limited to those who need to know; and

(f) Timely resolution.

##### § 422.3 Inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

A research institution that conducts extramural research funded by USDA bears primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct allegations reported directly to it. The research institution must perform an inquiry in response to an allegation, and must follow the inquiry with an investigation if the inquiry determines that the allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance. The responsibilities for adjudication must be separate from those for inquiry and investigation. In most instances, USDA will rely on a research institution conducting extramural research to promptly:

(a) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged research misconduct;

(b) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted;

(c) Acquire, prepare, and maintain appropriate records of allegations of extramural research misconduct and all related inquiries, investigations, and findings; and

(d) Take action to ensure the following:

(1) The integrity of research;

(2) The rights and interests of the subject of the investigation and the public are protected;

(3) The observance of legal requirements or responsibilities including cooperation with criminal investigations; and

(4) Appropriate safeguards for subjects of allegations, as well as informants (see § 422.6). These safeguards should include timely written notification of subjects regarding substantive allegations made against them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access to the data and other evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to respond to allegations, the supporting evidence and the proposed findings of research misconduct, if any.

##### § 422.4 USDA Panel to determine appropriateness of research misconduct policy.

Before USDA will rely on a research institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of an allegation in accordance with this part, the research institution where the research misconduct is alleged must provide the ARIO its policies and procedures related to research misconduct at the institution. The research institution has the option of providing either a written copy of such policies and procedures or a Web site address where such policies and procedures can be accessed. The ARIO to whom the policies and procedures were made available shall convene a panel comprised of the USDA RIO and ARIOs from the Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Panel will review the research institution's policies and procedures for compliance with the OSTP Policy and render a decision regarding the research institution's ability to adequately resolve research misconduct allegations. The ARIO will inform the research institution of the Panel's determination that its inquiry, investigation, and adjudication procedures are sufficient. If the Panel determines that the research institution does not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to conduct inquiry, investigation, and adjudication proceedings, or that the research institution is in any way unfit or unprepared to handle the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication in a prompt, unbiased, fair, and independent manner, the ARIO will inform the research institution in writing of the Panel's decision. An appropriate USDA agency, as determined by the Panel, will then conduct the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct in accordance with this part. If an allegation of research misconduct is made regarding extramural research conducted at a Federal research institution (whether USDA or not), it is presumed that the Federal research institution has research misconduct procedures consistent with the OSTP Policy. USDA reserves the right to convene the Panel to assess the sufficiency of a Federal agency's research misconduct procedures, should there be any question whether the agency's procedures will ensure a fair, unbiased, equitable, and independent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication process.

##### § 422.5 Reservation of right to conduct subsequent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.

(a) USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation. This may be necessary if the USDA RIO or ARIO believes, in his or her sound discretion, that despite the Panel's finding that the research institution in question had appropriate and OSTP-compliant research misconduct procedures in place, the research institution conducting the extramural research at issue:

(1) Did not adhere to its own research misconduct procedures;

(2) Did not conduct research misconduct proceedings in a fair, unbiased, or independent manner; or

(3) Has not completed research misconduct inquiry, investigation, or adjudication in a timely manner.

(b) Additionally, USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation for any other reason that the USDA RIO or ARIO considers it appropriate to conduct research misconduct proceedings in lieu of the research institution's conducting the extramural research at issue. This right is subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) In cases where the USDA RIO or ARIO believes it is necessary for USDA to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation, the USDA RIO or ARIO shall reconvene the Panel, which will determine whether it is appropriate for the relevant USDA agency to conduct the research misconduct proceedings related to the allegation(s) of research misconduct. If the Panel determines that it is appropriate for a USDA agency to conduct the proceedings, the ARIO will immediately notify the research institution in question. The research institution must then promptly provide the relevant USDA agency with documentation of the research misconduct proceedings the research institution has conducted to that point, and the USDA agency will conduct research misconduct proceedings in accordance with the Agency research misconduct procedures.

##### § 422.6 Notification of USDA of allegations of research misconduct.

(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify OIG and the USDA RIO of all allegations of research misconduct involving USDA funds when the institution inquiry into the allegation warrants the institution moving on to an investigation.

(b) Individuals at research institutions who suspect research misconduct at the institution should report allegations in accordance with the institution's research misconduct policies and procedures. Anyone else who suspects that researchers or research institutions performing Federally-funded research may have engaged in research misconduct is encouraged to make a formal allegation of research misconduct to OIG.

(1) OIG may be notified using any of the following methods:

(i) Via the OIG Hotline: Telephone: (202) 690-1622, (800) 424-9121, (202) 690-1202 (TDD).

(2) The source or sources of funding for the research project or research projects involved in the alleged misconduct;

(3) Important dates;

(4) Any documentation that bears upon the allegation; and

(5) Any other potentially relevant information.

(d) Safeguards for informants give individuals the confidence that they can bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of appropriate authorities or serve as informants to an inquiry or an investigation without suffering retribution. Safeguards include protection against retaliation for informants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective procedures for the examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct, and diligence in protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make allegations of research misconduct in good faith. The identity of informants who wish to remain anonymous will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law or regulation.

##### § 422.7 Notification of ARIO during an inquiry or investigation.

(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify the ARIO should the institution become aware during an inquiry or investigation that:

(1) Public health or safety is at risk;

(2) The resources, reputation, or other interests of USDA are in need of protection;

(3) Research activities should be suspended;

(4) Federal action may be needed to protect the interest of a subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected;

(5) A premature public disclosure of the inquiry into or investigation of the allegation may compromise the process;

(6) The scientific community or the public should be informed; or

(7) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.

(b) If research misconduct proceedings reveal behavior that may be criminal in nature at any point during the proceedings, the institution must promptly notify the ARIO.

##### § 422.8 Communication of research misconduct policies and procedures.

Institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research are to maintain and effectively communicate to their staffs policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the guidelines in this part. The institution is to inform their researchers and staff members who conduct USDA-funded extramural research when and under what circumstances USDA is to be notified of allegations of research misconduct, and when and under what circumstances USDA is to be updated on research misconduct proceedings.

##### § 422.9 Documents required.

(a) A research institution that conducts USDA-funded extramural research must maintain the following documents related to an allegation of research misconduct at the research institution:

(1) A written statement describing the original allegation;

(2) A copy of the formal notification presented to the subject of the allegation;

(3) A written report describing the inquiry stage and its outcome including copies of all supporting documentation;

(4) A description of the methods and procedures used to gather and evaluate information pertinent to the alleged misconduct during inquiry and investigation stages;

(5) A written report of the investigation, including the evidentiary record and supporting documentation;

(6) A written statement of the findings; and

(7) If applicable, a statement of recommended corrective actions, and any response to such a statement by the subject of the original allegation, and/or other interested parties, including any corrective action plan.

(b) The research institution must retain the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section for at least 3 years following the final adjudication of the alleged research misconduct.

##### § 422.10 Reporting to USDA.

Following completion of an investigation into allegations of research misconduct, the institution conducting extramural research must provide to the ARIO a copy of the evidentiary record, the report of the investigation, recommendations made to the institution's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's determination, the institution's corrective action taken or planned, and the written response of the individual who is the subject of the allegation to any recommendations.

##### § 422.11 Research records and evidence.

(a) A research institution that conducts extramural research supported by USDA funds, as the responsible legal entity for the USDA-supported research, has a continuing obligation to create and maintain adequate records (including documents and other evidentiary matter) as may be required by any subsequent inquiry, investigation, finding, adjudication, or other proceeding.

(b) Whenever an investigation is initiated, the research institution must promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all relevant research records and evidence as may be necessary to conduct the research misconduct proceedings. This must be accomplished before the research institution notifies the researcher/respondent of the allegation, or immediately thereafter.

(c) The original research records and evidence taken into custody by the research institution shall be inventoried and stored in a secure place and manner. Research records involving raw data shall include the devices or instruments on which they reside. However, if deemed appropriate by the research institution or investigator, research data or records that reside on or in instruments or devices may be copied and removed from those instruments or devices as long as the copies are complete, accurate, and have substantially equivalent evidentiary value as the data or records have when the data or records reside on the instruments or devices. Such copies of data or records shall be made by a disinterested, qualified technician and not by the subject of the original allegation or other interested parties. When the relevant data or records have been removed from the devices or instruments, the instruments or devices need not be maintained as evidence.

##### § 422.12 Remedies for noncompliance.

USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the administrative actions available to remedy a finding of research misconduct. Such actions may include the recovery of funds, correction of the research record, debarment of the researcher(s) that engaged in the research misconduct, proper attribution, or any other action deemed appropriate to remedy the instance(s) of research misconduct. The agency should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowingly conducted, intentional, or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or had significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare. In determining the appropriate administrative action, the appropriate agency must impose a remedy that is commensurate with the infraction as described in the finding of research misconduct.

##### § 422.13 Appeals.

(a) If USDA relied on an institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication, the alleged person(s) should first follow the institution's appeal policy and procedures.

(b) USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the appeal process when a finding of research misconduct is elevated to the agency.

##### § 422.14 Relationship to other requirements.

###### e.g.,

Some of the research covered by this part also may be subject to regulations of other governmental agencies (a university that receives funding from a USDA agency and also under a grant from another Federal agency). If more than one agency of the Federal Government has jurisdiction, USDA will cooperate with the other agency(ies) in designating a lead agency. When USDA is not the lead agency, it will rely on the lead agency following its policies and procedures in determining whether there is a finding of research misconduct. Further, USDA may, in consultation with the lead agency, take action to protect the health and safety of the public, to promote the integrity of the USDA-supported research and research process, or to conserve public funds. When appropriate, USDA will seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.

#### PARTS 423-499 [RESERVED]

### Chapter VI - Department of State

#### PART 600 - THE UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS

##### § 600.101 Applicability.

Under the authority listed above, the Department of State adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except for:

(a) The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards set forth in 2 CFR part 200 (Subparts A through F) shall apply to all non-Federal entities, except as noted below.

### Chapter VII - Agency for International Development

#### PART 700 - UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS

##### Subpart A - Acronyms and Definitions

###### § 700.1 Definitions.

These are the definitions for terms used in this part. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities.

####### Activity

means a set of actions through which inputs-such as commodities, technical assistance, training, or resource transfers-are mobilized to produce specific outputs, such as vaccinations given, schools built, microenterprise loans issued, or policies changed. Activities are undertaken to achieve objectives that have been formally approved and notified to Congress.

####### Agreement Officer

means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, terminate and/or closeout assistance agreements subject to this part, and make related determinations and findings on behalf of USAID. An Agreement Officer can only act within the scope of a duly authorized warrant or other valid delegation of authority. The term "Agreement Officer" includes persons warranted as "Grant Officers." It also includes certain authorized representatives of the Agreement Officer acting within the limits of their authority as delegated by the Agreement Officer.

####### Apparently successful applicant(s)

means the applicant(s) for USAID funding recommended for an award after merit review, but who has not yet been awarded a grant, cooperative agreement or other assistance award by the Agreement Officer. Apparently successful applicant status confers no right and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award, which still must be executed by the Agreement Officer.

####### Award

means financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants, cooperative agreements, and other agreements in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not include: Technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; contracts which are required to be entered into and administered under procurement laws and regulations.

####### Branding strategy

means a strategy the apparently successful applicant submits at the specific request of an USAID Agreement Officer after merit review of an application for USAID funding, describing how the program, project, or activity is named and positioned, as well as how it is promoted and communicated to beneficiaries and cooperating country citizens. It identifies all donors and explains how they will be acknowledged. A Branding Strategy is required even if a Presumptive Exception is approved in the Marking Plan.

####### Commodities

mean any material, article, supply, goods or equipment, excluding recipient offices, vehicles, and non-deliverable items for recipient's internal use in administration of the USAID-funded grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement or subagreement.

####### Date of completion

means the date on which all work under an award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment, on which USAID sponsorship ends.

####### Marking plan

means a plan that the apparently successful applicant submits at the specific request of a USAID Agreement Officer after merit review of an application for USAID funding, detailing the public communications, commodities, and program materials and other items that will visibly bear the USAID Identity. Recipients may request approval of Presumptive Exceptions to marking requirements in the Marking Plan.

####### Principal officer,e.g.,

means the most senior officer in an USAID Operating Unit in the field,USAID Mission Director or USAID Representative. For global programs managed from Washington but executed across many countries such as disaster relief and assistance to internally displaced persons, humanitarian emergencies or immediate post conflict and political crisis response, the cognizant Principal Officer may be an Office Director, for example, the Directors of USAID/W/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Office of Transition Initiatives. For non-presence countries, the cognizant Principal Officer is the Senior USAID officer in a regional USAID Operating Unit responsible for the non-presence country, or in the absence of such a responsible operating unit, the Principle U.S Diplomatic Officer in the non-presence country exercising delegated authority from USAID.

####### Program

means an organized set of activities and allocation of resources directed toward a common purpose, objective, or goal undertaken or proposed by an organization to carry out the responsibilities assigned to it. Projects include all the marginal costs of inputs (including the proposed investment) technically required to produce a discrete marketable output or a desired result (for example, services from a fully functional water/sewage treatment facility).

####### Public communications

They include, but are not limited to, correspondence, publications, studies, reports, audio visual productions, and other informational products; applications, forms, press and promotional materials used in connection with USAID funded programs, projects or activities, including signage and plaques; Web sites/Internet activities; and events such as training courses, conferences, seminars, press conferences and the like.

####### Suspension

means an action by USAID that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under USAID regulations implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, "Debarment and Suspension." See 2 CFR part 780.

####### Unrecovered indirect cost

means the difference between the amount awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

####### USAID

means the United States Agency for International Development.

####### USAID Identity,http://www.usaid.gov/branding

(Identity) means the official marking for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) comprised of the USAID logo or seal and new brandmark with the tagline that clearly communicates our assistance is "from the American people." In exceptional circumstances, upon a written determination by the USAID Administrator, the definition of the USAID Identity may be amended to include additional or substitute use of a logo or seal and tagline representing a presidential initiative or other high level interagency Federal initiative that requires consistent and uniform branding and marking by all participating agencies. The USAID Identity (including any required presidential initiative or related identity) is available on the USAID Web site atand is provided without royalty, license or other fee to recipients of USAID funded grants or cooperative agreements or other assistance awards.

##### Subpart B - General Provisions

###### § 700.2 Adoption of 2 CFR Part 200.

Under the authority listed above the Agency for International Development adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards to Non-Federal Entities (subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200), as supplemented by this part, as the Agency for International Development (USAID) policies and procedures for financial assistance administration. This part satisfies the requirements of 2 CFR 200.110(a) and gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

###### § 700.3 Applicability.

(a) Subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200 apply to for-profit entities. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 30, Cost Accounting Standards, and Part 31, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures, takes precedence over the cost principles in Subpart E for Federal awards to for-profit entities.

(b) Subpart E applies to foreign organizations and foreign public entities, except where the Federal awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statute or regulations of a foreign government.

###### § 700.4 Exceptions.

Consistent with 2 CFR 200.102(b):

(a) Exceptions on a case-by-case basis for individual non-Federal entities may be authorized by USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, except where otherwise required by law or where OMB or other approval is expressly required by this Part. No case-by-case exceptions may be granted to the provisions of Subpart F-Audit Requirements of this Part.

(b) USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, is also authorized to approve exceptions, on a class or an individual case basis, to USAID program specific assistance regulations other than those which implement statutory and executive order requirements.

(c) The Federal awarding agency may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of Federal awards or non-Federal entities when approved by OMB, required by Federal statutes or regulations except for the requirements in Subpart F-Audit Requirements of this part. A Federal awarding agency may apply less restrictive requirements when making awards at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, or when making fixed amount awards as defined in Subpart A-Acronyms and Definitions of 2 CFR part 200, except for those requirements imposed by statute or in Subpart F-Audit Requirements of this part.

###### § 700.5 Supersession.

Effective December 26, 2014, this part supersedes the following regulations under Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations: 22 CFR part 226, "Administration of Assistance Awards To U.S. Non-Governmental Organizations."

##### Subpart C - Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards

###### § 700.6 Metric system of measurement.

(a) The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce.

(b) Wherever measurements are required or authorized, they must be made, computed, and recorded in metric system units of measurement, unless otherwise authorized by the Agreement Officer in writing when it has been found that such usage is impractical or is likely to cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets. Where the metric system is not the predominant standard for a particular application, measurements may be expressed in both the metric and the traditional equivalent units, provided the metric units are listed first.

###### § 700.7 Advance payment.

Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Letter of Credit, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer and must comply with applicable guidance in 31 CFR part 205.

##### Subpart D - Post Federal Award Requirements

###### Termination and Disputes

####### § 700.14 Termination.

If at any time USAID determines that continuation of all or part of the funding for a program should be suspended or terminated because such assistance would not be in the national interest of the United States or would be in violation of an applicable law, then USAID may, following notice to the recipient, suspend or terminate the award in whole or in part and prohibit the recipient from incurring additional obligations chargeable to the award other than those costs specified in the notice of suspension. If a suspension is put into effect and the situation causing the suspension continues for 60 calendar days or more, then USAID may terminate the award in whole or in part on written notice to the recipient and cancel any portion of the award which has not been disbursed or irrevocably committed to third parties.

####### § 700.15 Disputes.

(a) Any dispute under or relating to a grant or agreement will be decided by the USAID Agreement Officer. The Agreement Officer must furnish the recipient a written copy of the decision.

(b) Decisions of the USAID Agreement Officer will be final unless, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the decision, the recipient appeals the decision to USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy. Appeals must be in writing with a copy concurrently furnished to the Agreement Officer.

(c) In order to facilitate review of the record by the USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, the recipient will be given an opportunity to submit written evidence in support of its appeal. No hearing will be provided.

(d) Decisions by the Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, will be final.

###### USAID - Specific Requirements

####### § 700.16 Marking.

(a) USAID policy is that all programs, projects, activities, public communications, and commodities, specified further at paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, partially or fully funded by a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward must be marked appropriately overseas with the USAID Identity, of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, other donor's or any other third party's identity or logo.

(1) USAID reserves the right to require the USAID Identity to be larger and more prominent if it is the majority donor, or to require that a cooperating country government's identity be larger and more prominent if circumstances warrant; any such requirement will be on a case-by-case basis depending on the audience, program goals and materials produced.

(2) USAID reserves the right to request pre-production review of USAID funded public communications and program materials for compliance with the approved Marking Plan.

(3) USAID reserves the right to require marking with the USAID Identity in the event the recipient does not choose to mark with its own identity or logo.

(4) To ensure that the marking requirements "flow down" to subrecipients of subawards, recipients of USAID funded grants and cooperative agreements or other assistance awards are required to include a USAID-approved marking provision in any USAID funded subaward, to read as follows:

(b) Subject to § 700.16(a), (h), and (j), program, project, or activity sites funded by USAID, including visible infrastructure projects (for example, roads, bridges, buildings) or other programs, projects, or activities that are physical in nature (for example, agriculture, forestry, water management), must be marked with the USAID Identity. Temporary signs or plaques should be erected early in the construction or implementation phase. When construction or implementation is complete, a permanent, durable sign, plaque or other marking must be installed.

(c) Subject to § 700.16(a), (h), and (j), technical assistance, studies, reports, papers, publications, audio-visual productions, public service announcements, Web sites/Internet activities and other promotional, informational, media, or communications products funded by USAID must be marked with the USAID Identity.

(1) Any "public communications" as defined in § 700.1, funded by USAID, in which the content has not been approved by USAID, must contain the following disclaimer:

(2) The recipient must provide the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) or other USAID personnel designated in the grant or cooperative agreement with at least two copies of all program and communications materials produced under the award. In addition, the recipient must submit one electronic and/or one hard copy of all final documents to USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse.

(d) Subject to § 700.16(a), (h), and (j), events financed by USAID such as training courses, conferences, seminars, exhibitions, fairs, workshops, press conferences and other public activities, must be marked appropriately with the USAID Identity. Unless directly prohibited and as appropriate to the surroundings, recipients should display additional materials such as signs and banners with the USAID Identity. In circumstances in which the USAID Identity cannot be displayed visually, recipients are encouraged otherwise to acknowledge USAID and the American people's support.

(e) Subject to § 700.16(a), (h), and (j), all commodities financed by USAID, including commodities or equipment provided under humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, and all other equipment, supplies and other materials funded by USAID, and their export packaging, must be marked with the USAID Identity.

(f) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Branding Strategy, defined in § 700.1. The proposed Branding Strategy will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review for adequacy the proposed Branding Strategy, and will negotiate, approve and include the Branding Strategy in the award. Failure to submit or negotiate a Branding Strategy within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award.

(g) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Marking Plan, defined in § 700.1. The Marking Plan may include requests for approval of Presumptive Exceptions, paragraph (h) of this section. All estimated costs associated with branding and marking USAID programs, such as plaques, labels, banners, press events, promotional materials, and the like, must be included in the total cost estimate of the grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award, and are subject to revision and negotiation with the Agreement Officer upon submission of the Marking Plan. The Marking Plan will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review for adequacy the proposed Marking Plan, and will negotiate, approve and include the Marking Plan in the award. Failure to submit or negotiate a Marking Plan within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award. Agreement Officers have the discretion to suspend the implementation requirements of the Marking Plan if circumstances warrant. Recipients of USAID funded grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward should retain copies of any specific marking instructions or waivers in their project, program or activity files. Agreement Officer's Representatives will be assigned responsibility to monitor marking requirements on the basis of the approved Marking Plan.

(h) Presumptive exceptions:

(1) The above marking requirements in § 700.16(a) through (e) may not apply if marking would:

(i) Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program or materials where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of the program and materials, such as election monitoring or ballots, and voter information literature; political party support or public policy advocacy or reform; independent media, such as television and radio broadcasts, newspaper articles and editorials; public service announcements or public opinion polls and surveys.

(ii) Diminish the credibility of audits, reports, analyses, studies, or policy recommendations whose data or findings must be seen as independent.

(iii) Undercut host-country government "ownership" of constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, studies, assessments, reports, publications, surveys or audits, public service announcements, or other communications better positioned as "by" or "from" a cooperating country ministry or government official.

(iv) Impair the functionality of an item, such as sterilized equipment or spare parts.

(v) Incur substantial costs or be impractical, such as items too small or other otherwise unsuited for individual marking, such as food in bulk.

(vi) Offend local cultural or social norms, or be considered inappropriate on such items as condoms, toilets, bed pans, or similar commodities.

(vii) Conflict with international law.

(2) These exceptions are presumptive, not automatic and must be approved by the Agreement Officer. Apparently successful applicants may request approval of one or more of the presumptive exceptions, depending on the circumstances, in their Marking Plan. The Agreement Officer will review requests for presumptive exceptions for adequacy, along with the rest of the Marking Plan. When reviewing a request for approval of a presumptive exception, the Agreement Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID identity is removed. Exceptions approved will apply to subrecipients unless otherwise provided by USAID.

(i) In cases where the Marking Plan has not been complied with, the Agreement Officer will initiate corrective action. Such action may involve informing the recipient of a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward of instances of noncompliance and requesting that the recipient carry out its responsibilities as set forth in the Marking Plan and award. Major or repeated non-compliance with the Marking Plan will be governed by the uniform suspension and termination procedures set forth at 2 CFR 200.338 through 2 CFR 200.342, and 2 CFR 700.14.

######## Waivers.

(j)(1)USAID Principal Officers, defined for purposes of this provision at § 700.1, may at any time after award waive in whole or in part the USAID approved Marking Plan, including USAID marking requirements for each USAID funded program, project, activity, public communication or commodity, or in exceptional circumstances may make a waiver by region or country, if the Principal Officer determines that otherwise USAID required marking would pose compelling political, safety, or security concerns, or marking would have an adverse impact in the cooperating country. USAID recipients may request waivers of the Marking Plan in whole or in part, through the AOR. No marking is required while a waiver determination is pending. The waiver determination on safety or security grounds must be made in consultation with U.S. Government security personnel if available, and must consider the same information that applies to determinations of the safety and security of U.S. Government employees in the cooperating country, as well as any information supplied by the AOR or the recipient for whom the waiver is sought. When reviewing a request for approval of a waiver, the Principal Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID Identity is removed. Approved waivers are not limited in duration but are subject to Principal Officer review at any time due to changed circumstances. Approved waivers "flow down" to recipients of subawards unless specified otherwise. Principal Officers may also authorize the removal of USAID markings already affixed if circumstances warrant. Principal Officers' determinations regarding waiver requests are subject to appeal to the Principal Officer's cognizant Assistant Administrator. Recipients may appeal by submitting a written request to reconsider the Principal Officer's waiver determination to the cognizant Assistant Administrator.

######## Non-retroactivity.

(2)Marking requirements apply to any obligation of USAID funds for new awards as of January 2, 2006. Marking requirements also will apply to new obligations under existing awards, such as incremental funding actions, as of January 2, 2006, when the total estimated cost of the existing award has been increased by USAID or the scope of effort is changed to accommodate any costs associated with marking. In the event a waiver is rescinded, the marking requirements will apply from the date forward that the waiver is rescinded. In the event a waiver is rescinded after the period of performance as defined in 2 CFR 200.77 but before closeout as defined in 2 CFR 200.16., the USAID mission or operating unit with initial responsibility to administer the marking requirements must make a cost benefit analysis as to requiring USAID marking requirements after the date of completion of the affected programs, projects, activities, public communications or commodities.

(k) The USAID Identity and other guidance will be provided at no cost or fee to recipients of USAID grants, cooperative agreements or other assistance awards or subawards. Additional costs associated with marking requirements will be met by USAID if reasonable, allowable, and allocable under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. The standard cost reimbursement provisions of the grant, cooperative agreement, other assistance award or subaward must be followed when applying for reimbursement of additional marking costs.

###### § 700.8 Payment.

(a) Use of resources before requesting advance payments. To the extent available, the non-Federal entity must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. This paragraph is not applicable to such earnings which are generated as foreign currencies.

(b) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of advance payments under Federal awards are as follows:

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, USAID does not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a non-Federal entity or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to the non-Federal entity. However, the non-Federal entity must be able to account for receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.

(2) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

###### § 700.9 Property standards.

####### Real property.

(a)Unless the agreement provides otherwise, title to real property will vest in accordance with 2 CFR 200.311.

####### Equipment.

(b)Unless the agreement provides otherwise, title to equipment will vest in accordance with 2 CFR 200.313.

###### § 700.10 Cost sharing or matching.

Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which would have been charged to the Federal award under the non-Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

###### § 700.11 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms.

(a) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. To permit USAID, in accordance with the small business provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to give United States small business firms an opportunity to participate in supplying commodities and services procured under the award, the recipient must to the maximum extent possible provide the following information to the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), USAID, Washington, DC 20523, at least 45 days prior to placing any order or contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold:

(1) Brief general description and quantity of goods or services;

(2) Closing date for receiving quotations, proposals or bids; and

(3) Address where solicitations or specifications can be obtained.

(b) [Reserved]

###### § 700.12 Contract provisions.

(a) The non-Federal entity's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200-Contract Provisions for non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards.

(b) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the simplified acquisition threshold) awarded by the non-Federal entity must include a provision to the effect that the non-Federal Entity, USAID, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, must have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

###### § 700.13 Additional provisions for awards to for-profit entities.

(a) This paragraph contains additional provisions that apply to awards to for-profit entities. These provisions supplement and make exceptions for awards to for-profit entities from other provisions of this part.

(1) Prohibition against profit. No funds will be paid as profit to any for-profit entity receiving or administering Federal financial assistance as a recipient or subrecipient. Federal financial assistance does not include contracts as defined at 2 CFR 200.22, other contracts a Federal agency uses to buy goods or services from a contractor, or contracts to operate Federal government owned, contractor operated facilities (GOCOs). Profit is any amount in excess of allowable direct and indirect costs.

(2) [Reserved]

(b) [Reserved]

#### PART 701 - PARTNER VETTING IN USAID ASSISTANCE

##### § 701.1 Definitions.

This section contains the definitions for terms used in this part. Other terms used in the part are defined at 2 CFR part 200. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities.

###### Key individual

means the principal officer of the organization's governing body (for example, chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees); the principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (for example, executive director, deputy director, president, vice president); the program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as identified in the solicitation or resulting cooperative agreement. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime recipient, must be vetted.

###### Key personnel,Vetting official

means those individuals identified for approval as part of substantial involvement in a cooperative agreement whose positions are essential to the successful implementation of an award.means the USAID employee identified in the application or award as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the Partner Information Form, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security (SEC), and conveying the vetting determination to each applicant, potential subrecipients and contractors subject to vetting, and the agreement officer. The vetting official is not part of the office making the award selection and has no involvement in the selection process.

##### § 701.2 Applicability.

The requirements established in this part apply to non-Federal entities, non-profit organizations, for-profit entities, and foreign organizations.

##### § 701.3 Partner vetting.

(a) It is USAID policy that USAID may determine that a particular award is subject to vetting in the interest of national security. In that case, USAID may require vetting of the key individuals of applicants, including key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the applicant, first tier subrecipients, contractors, and any other class of subawards and procurements as identified in the assistance solicitation and resulting award. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award to any applicant who determined ineligible by the vetting process.

(b) When USAID determines an award to be subject to vetting, the agreement officer determines the appropriate stage of the award cycle to require applicants to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in the assistance solicitation. The agreement officer must specify in the assistance solicitation the stage at which the applicants will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13. As a general matter those applicants who will be vetted will be typically the applicants that have been determined to be apparently successful.

(c) Selection of the successful applicant proceeds separately from vetting. The agreement officer makes the selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that, based on the vetting results, the apparently successful applicant is eligible or ineligible for an award. However, no applicants will be excluded from an award until after vetting has been completed.

(d) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the agreement officer may only award to an applicant that has been determined to be eligible after completion of the vetting process.

(e)(1) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the recipient must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:

(i) Key individuals; or

(ii) Subrecipients and contractors for which vetting is required.

(2) The recipient must submit the completed Partner Information Form within 15 days of the change in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(f) USAID may vet key individuals of the recipient, subrecipients and contractors periodically during program implementation using information already submitted on the Form.

(g) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of subawards when the prime recipient requests prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) for the subaward, transfer, or contracting out of any work.

(h) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of contractors of certain services. The agreement officer must identify these services in the assistance solicitation and any resulting award.

(i) When vetting of subawards is required, the agreement officer must not approve the subaward, transfer, or contracting out, or the procurement of certain classes of items until the organization subject to vetting has been determined eligible. When vetting of contractors is required, the recipient may not procure the identified services until the contractor has been determined to be eligible.

(j) The recipient may instruct prospective subrecipients or, when applicable contractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the recipient submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.

###### Pre-award provision and award term.

(k)(1) The agreement officer must insert the pre-award provision Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements in Appendix B of this part in all assistance solicitations USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

(2) The agreement officer must insert the award term Partner Vetting in Appendix B in all assistance solicitations and awards USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

##### Appendix B to Part 701 - Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements and Award Term

The applicant and any proposed subrecipient or contractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the agreement officer or the agreement officer's representatives. The agreement officer designates the vetting official as the only individual authorized to clarify the applicant's and proposed subrecipient's and contractor's vetting information.

(d)(1) The vetting official notifies the applicant that it: (i) Is eligible based on the vetting results, (ii) is ineligible based on the vetting results, or (iii) must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.

(2) The vetting official will coordinate with the agency that provided the data being used for vetting prior to notifying the applicant or releasing any information.

(e) Reconsideration: (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an applicant that vetting has determined to be ineligible may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.

(2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the applicant's additional information merits a revised decision.

(3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.

(f) Revisions to vetting information: (1) Applicants who change key individuals, whether the applicant has previously been determined eligible or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical portion of the application.

(2) The vetting official will follow the vetting process of this provision for any revision of the applicant's Form.

(g) Award. At the time of award, the agreement officer will confirm with the vetting official that the apparently successful applicant is eligible after vetting. The agreement officer may award only to an apparently successful applicant that is eligible after vetting.

(a) The recipient must comply with the vetting requirements for key individuals under this award.

(b) Definitions: As used in this provision, "key individual," "key personnel," and "vetting official" have the meaning contained in 22 CFR 701.1.

(ii) Is ineligible based on the vetting results, or

(iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specifies.

(2) The vetting official will include information that USAID determines releasable. USAID will determine what information may be released consistent with applicable law and Executive Orders, and with the concurrence of relevant agencies.

(e) The inability to be deemed eligible as described in this award term may be determined to be a material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award and may subject the recipient to suspension or termination as specified in the subpart "Remedies for Noncompliance" at 2 CFR part 200.

(f) Reconsideration: (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the recipient or prospective subrecipient or contractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.

(2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the recipient's additional information merits a revised decision.

(3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.

Although formal rules of procedure do not apply to the conference, the participant or contractor may be represented by counsel and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. After consideration of the information and materials presented, the official shall, in writing, advise the participant or contractor of the decision to withdraw, modify or affirm the limited denial of participation. If the decision is made to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, the participant shall be advised of the right to request a formal hearing in writing within 30 days of receipt of the notice of decision.

####### Falsification

means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.

####### Finding of Research Misconduct

means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.

####### Inquiry

means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.

####### Investigation

means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.

####### Plagiarism

means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.

(c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:

(1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;

(2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).

(3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.

(d) DOE may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:

(1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;

(2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;

(3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,

(4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.

(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.

(f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and DOE, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:

####### Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations.

(1)The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: Protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.

####### Objectivity and expertise.

(2)The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.

####### Timeliness.

(3)The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.

####### Confidentiality.

(4)To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.

####### Remediation and sanction.

(5)If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.

(g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.

(h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.

###### § 910.133 Deviation authority.

####### General.

(a)(1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with § 910.372, exceptions under 2 CFR 200.102, and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 910.130 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities are not subject to this section.

(2) A single-case deviation is a deviation which applies to one financial assistance transaction and one applicant, recipient, or subrecipient only.

(3) A class deviation is a deviation which applies to more than one financial assistance transaction, applicant, recipient, or subrecipient.

####### Conditions for approval.

(b)The DOE/NNSA officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section may authorize a deviation only upon a written determination that the deviation is-

(1) Necessary to achieve program objectives;

(2) Necessary to conserve public funds;

(3) Otherwise essential to the public interest; or

(4) Necessary to achieve equity.

####### Approval procedures.

(c)(1) A deviation request must be in writing and must be submitted to the responsible DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer. An applicant for a subaward or a subrecipient shall submit any such request through the recipient.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section-

(i) A single-case deviation may be authorized by the responsible HCA.

(ii) A class deviation may be authorized by the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee.

(3) Whenever the approval of OMB, other Federal agency, or other DOE/NNSA office is required to authorize a deviation, the proposed deviation must be submitted to the Director, Office of Acquisition Management, for DOE actions, and the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management for NNSA, for NNSA actions, or designee for concurrence prior to submission to the authorizing official.

####### Notice.

(d)Whenever a request for a class deviation is approved, DOE/NNSA will identify this class deviation (as applicable) in the Notice of Funding Opportunity(s) that may be affected.

####### Subawards.

(e)A recipient may use a deviation in a subaward only with the prior written approval of a DOE/NNSA Contracting Officer.

##### Subpart C [Reserved]

##### Subpart D - Post Award Federal Requirements for For-Profit Entities

###### § 910.350 Applicability of 2 CFR part 200.

(a) As stated in 2 CFR 910.22, unless otherwise noted in this part , the definition of Non-Federal entity found in 2 CFR 200.1 is expanded for DOE to include for-profit organizations in addition to states, local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education (IHE), and nonprofit organizations.

(b) A for-profit organization is defined as one that distributes any profit not reinvested into the business as profit or dividends to its employees or shareholders.

(c) Subpart D of 2 CFR part 910 contains specific changes to 2 CFR part 200 that apply only to For-Profit Recipients and, unless otherwise specified, subrecipients. In some cases, the coverage in Subpart D will replace the language in a specific section of 2 CFR part 200.

###### § 910.352 Cost Principles.

For For-Profit Entities, the Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR 31.2 (Contracts with Commercial Organizations) must be followed in lieu of the Cost principles contained in 2 CFR 200.400 through 200.476, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document. This applies to For-Profit entities whether they are recipients or subrecipients.

###### § 910.354 Payment.

(a) For-Profit Recipients are an exception to 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) which requires that non-Federal entities be paid in advance as long as certain conditions are met.

(b) For For-Profit Recipients who are paid directly by DOE, reimbursement is the preferred method of payment. Under the reimbursement method of payment, the Federal awarding agency must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency reasonably believes the request to be improper.

###### § 910.356 Audits.

See Subpart F of this part (Sections 910.500 through 910.521) for specific DOE regulations which apply to audits of DOE's For-Profit Recipients. For-Profit entities are an exception to the Single Audit requirements contained in Subpart F of 2 CFR 200 and therefore the regulations contained in 2 CFR 910 Subpart F apply instead.

###### § 910.358 Profit or fee for SBIR/STTR.

(a) As authorized by 2 CFR 200.400 (g), DOE may expressly allow non-federal entities to earn a profit or fee resulting from Federal financial assistance.

(b) DOE allows a profit or fee to be paid under two of its financial assistance programs only: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR).

(c) Awards under these programs will contain a specific provision which allows a profit or fee to be paid.

(d) Profit or Fee is unallowable for all other DOE programs which award grants and cooperative agreements.

###### § 910.360 Real property and equipment.

####### Prior approvals for acquisition with Federal funds.

(a)Recipients may purchase real property or equipment with an acquisition cost per unit of $5,000 or more in whole or in part with Federal funds only with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or in accordance with express award terms.

####### Title.

(b)Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient, subject to all terms and conditions of the award and that the recipient shall:

(1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, as may be determined by the contracting officer;

(2) Not encumber or permit any encumbrance on the real property or equipment without the prior written approval of the contracting officer;

(3) Use and dispose of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section; and

(4) Properly record, and consent to the Department's ability to properly record if the recipient fails to do so, UCC financing statement(s) for all equipment purchased with Federal funds (Financial assistance awards made under the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program are exempt from this requirement unless otherwise specified within the grant agreement); such a filing is required when the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $1,000,000, and the Contracting Officer may require it in his or her discretion when the Federal share is less than $1,000,000. These financing statement(s) must be approved in writing by the contracting officer prior to the recording, and they shall provide notice that the recipient's title to all equipment (not real property) purchased with Federal funds under the financial assistance agreement is conditional pursuant to the terms of this section, and that the Government retains an undivided reversionary interest in the equipment. The UCC financing statement(s) must be filed before the contracting officer may reimburse the recipient for the Federal share of the equipment unless otherwise provided for in the relevant financial assistance agreement. The recipient shall further make any amendments to the financing statements or additional recordings, including appropriate continuation statements, as necessary or as the contracting officer may direct.

####### Remedies.

(c)If the recipient fails at any time to comply with any of the conditions or requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, then the contracting officer may:

(1) Notify the recipient of noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339, which may lead to suspension or termination of the award;

(2) Impose special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206 and 200.208 as amended by 910.372;

(3) Issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;

(4) In the case of a failure to properly record UCC financing statement(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, effect such a recording; and

(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.

####### Title to and Federal interest in real property or equipment offered as cost-share.

(d)As provided in 2 CFR 200.306(h), depending upon the purpose of the Federal award, a recipient may offer the fair market value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the recipient holds conditional title to the property and the Government has an undivided reversionary interest in the share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project. The property is treated as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and to the provisions of 2 CFR 200.311 and 200.313.

####### Insurance.

(e)Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.

####### Additional uses during and after the project period.

(f)Unless a statute and the award terms expressly provide for the vesting of unconditional title to real property or equipment with the recipient, the real property or equipment acquired wholly or in part with Federal funds is subject to the following:

(1) During the Project Period, the recipient must make real property and equipment available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:

(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;

(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.

(2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or if, as may be determined by the contracting officer, the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, or if the recipient suspends work on the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, if:

(i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used;

(ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded Federal award; and

(iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iv) If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the recipient must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

####### Disposition.

(g)(1) If, as determined by the contracting officer, an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, or if the recipient has suspended work on the project, the recipient has the following options:

(i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.

(ii) If the property is equipment (rather than real property) and with the written approval of the contracting officer, the recipient may replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment.

(iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

(iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.

(2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:

(i) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:

(A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to a third party designated by the contracting officer provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred; or

(B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.

(3) If the contracting officer fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

###### § 910.362 Intellectual property.

####### Scope.

(a)This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement made to a For-Profit entity by DOE.

####### Patents right-small business concerns.

(b)In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are "exceptional circumstances" as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled "Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations" which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.

####### Patent rights-other than small business concerns, e.g., large businesses

(c)-

####### No Patent Waiver.

(1)Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled "Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)-No Waiver" which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.

####### Patent Waiver Granted.

(2)Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:

(i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;

(ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or

(iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.

####### Special Provision.,e.g.,

(3)Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.

####### Rights in data-general rule.

(d)(1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled "Rights in Data-General".

(2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.

####### e.g.,

(3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,DOE specifying "open-source" treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.

####### Rights in data-programs covered under special protected data statutes.

(e)(1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled "Rights in Data-Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes" or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.

(2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.

####### Rights in data-SBIR/STTR programs.

(f)If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled "Rights in Data-SBIR Program".

####### Authorization and consent.

(g)(1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.

(2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.

(3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.

###### § 910.364 Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.

(a) Unless otherwise instructed, a recipient that obtains title to an invention made under an award shall submit annual reports on the utilization or efforts to obtain utilization of the invention for at least 10 years from the date the invention was first disclosed to DOE (Utilization Reports). Utilization Reports shall include at least the following information:

(1) Status of development;

(2) Date of first commercial sale or use;

(3) Gross royalties received by the recipient;

(4) The location of any manufacture of products embodying the subject invention; and

(5) Any such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify.

(b) To the extent data or information supplied in a Utilization Report is considered by the recipient to be privileged and confidential and is so marked by the recipient, DOE agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.

###### § 910.366 Export Control and U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.

####### Export Control.

(a)Any recipient of any award for research, development and/or demonstration must comply with all applicable U.S. laws regarding export control.

####### U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.

(b)It is the policy of DOE to ensure that DOE-funded research, development, and/or demonstration projects foster domestic manufacturing. Funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), therefore, may require that applicants submit a "U.S. Manufacturing Plan" in their applications. Such FOAs may encourage U.S. Manufacturing Plans to include proposals by recipients and any sub-recipients to manufacture DOE-funded technologies in the United States; however, the FOAs will also state that these plans should not include requirements regarding the source of inputs used during the manufacturing process. Regardless of whether such plans will be part of the merit review criteria or a program policy factor, and to the extent legally permissible, all awards subject to this subpart, including subawards, for research, development, and/or demonstration, must include a provision that provides plans by the recipient and any subrecipients to support manufacturing in the United States of technology developed under the award. The recipient and any subrecipients must agree to make those plans binding on any assignee or licensee or any entity otherwise acquiring rights to any subject invention or developed technology covered under the award. A recipient, subrecipient, assignee, licensee, or any entity otherwise acquiring the rights to any subject invention or developed technology may request a waiver or modification of U.S. manufacturing plans from DOE. DOE will determine whether to approve such a waiver in light of equitable considerations, including, for example, whether the requester satisfactorily shows that the planned support is not economically feasible and whether there is a satisfactory alternative net benefit to the U.S. economy if the requested waiver or modification is approved.

###### § 910.368 Change of control.

(a) Change of control is defined as any of the following:

(1) Any event by which any individual or entity other than the recipient becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the recipient;

(2) The recipient merges with or into any entity other than in a transaction in which the shares of the recipient's voting stock are converted into a majority of the voting stock of the surviving entity;

(3) The sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the recipient to any individual or entity other than the recipient in one or a series of related transactions;

(4) The adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the recipient; or

(5) Where the recipient is a wholly-owned subsidiary at the time of award or novation, and the recipient's parent entity undergoes a change of control as defined in this section.

(b) When the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $10,000,000 or DOE requests the information in writing, the recipient must provide the contracting officer with documentation identifying all parties who exercise control in the recipient at the time of award.

(c) When there is a change of control of a recipient, or the recipient has reason to know a change of control is likely, the recipient must notify the contracting officer within 30 days of its knowledge of such change of control. Such notification must include, at a minimum, copies of documents necessary to reflect the transaction that resulted or will result in the change of control, and identification of all entities, individuals or other parties to such transaction. Failure to notify the contracting officer of a change of control is grounds for suspension or termination of the award for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.

(d) The contracting officer must authorize a change of control for the purposes of the award. Failure to receive the contracting officer's authorization for a change of control may lead to a suspension of the award, termination for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or imposition of special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 910.372. Special award conditions may include but are not limited to:

(1) Additional reporting requirements related to the change of control; and

(2) Suspension of payments due to the recipient.

###### § 910.370 Novation of financial assistance agreements.

(a) Financial assistance agreements are not assignable absent written consent from the contracting officer. At his or her sole discretion, the contracting officer may, through novation, recognize a third party as the successor in interest to a financial assistance agreement if such recognition is in the Government's interest, conforms with all applicable laws and the third party's interest in the agreement arises out of the transfer of:

(1) All of the recipient's assets; or

(2) The entire portion of the assets necessary to perform the project described in the agreement.

(b) When the contracting officer determines that it is not in the Government's interest to consent to the novation of a financial assistance agreement from the original recipient to a third party, the original recipient remains subject to the terms of the financial assistance agreement, and the Department may exercise all legally available remedies under 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343, or that may be otherwise available, should the original recipient not perform.

(c) The contracting officer may require submission of any documentation in support of a request for novation, including but not limited to documents identified in 48 CFR Subpart 42.12. The contracting officer may use the format in 48 CFR 42.1204 as guidance for novation agreements identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

###### § 910.372 Special award conditions.

(a) In addition to the requirements of 2 CFR 200.206, the following actions may require the use of Specific Conditions as identified in 2 CFR 200.208:

(1) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award;

(2) Has a change of control as defined in § 910.368;

(3) Fails to comply with real property and equipment requirements at § 910.360; or

(4) Is not otherwise responsible.

(b) Allocation of Principal Rights

The Recipient may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this Patent Rights clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Recipient retains title, the Federal Government shall have a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. the subject invention throughout the world.

(c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Applications by Recipient

(1) The Recipient will disclose each subject invention to DOE within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for the administration of patent matters. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the award under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Recipient will promptly notify DOE of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Recipient.

(2) The Recipient will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying DOE within two years of disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the one-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the U.S., the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.

(3) The Recipient will file its initial patent application on an invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the U.S. after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Recipient will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to DOE, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of DOE, be granted.

(d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title

The Recipient will convey to DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention:

(1) If the Recipient fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this patent rights clause, or elects not to retain title; provided that DOE may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Recipient to disclose or elect within the specified times;

(2) In those countries in which the Recipient fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause; provided, however, that if the Recipient has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of DOE, the Recipient shall continue to retain title in that country; or

(3) In any country in which the Recipient decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

(e) Minimum Rights to Recipient and Protection of the Recipient Right To File

(1) The Recipient will retain a non-exclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Recipient fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope of the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the award was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.

(2) The Recipient's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulation, if any. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Recipient has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent the Recipient, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.

(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding Federal agency will furnish the Recipient a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Recipient will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Recipient) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Recipient has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulations, if any, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.

(f) Recipient Action To Protect Government's Interest

(1) The Recipient agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to:

(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions for which the Recipient retains title; and

(ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this Patent Rights clause, and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.

(2) The Recipient agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Recipient each subject invention made under this award in order that the Recipient can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient shall instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.

(3) The Recipient will notify DOE of any decision not to continue prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.

(4) The Recipient agrees to include, within the specification of any U.S. patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: "This invention was made with Government support under (identify the award) awarded by (identify DOE). The Government has certain rights in this invention."

(g) Subaward/Contract

(1) The Recipient will include this Patent Rights clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subrecipient/contractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in this Patent Rights clause, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractors' subject inventions.

(2) The Recipient will include in all other subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work, the patent rights clause required by 2 CFR 910.362(c).

(3) In the case of subawards/contracts at any tier, DOE, the Recipient, and the subrecipient/contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subrecipient/contractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by the clause.

(h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions

The Recipient agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Recipient or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Recipient and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Recipient also agrees to provide additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patent Rights clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without the permission of the Recipient.

(i) Preference for United States Industry.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Patent Rights clause, the Recipient agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the U.S. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Recipient or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the U.S. or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

(j) March-in-Rights

The Recipient agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the Agency to require the Recipient, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a non-exclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances and if the Recipient, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that:

(1) Such action is necessary because the Recipient or assignee has not taken or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;

(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or their licensees;

(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or licensee; or

(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this Patent Rights clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. is in breach of such agreement.

(k) Special Provisions for Awards With Nonprofit Organizations

If the Recipient is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:

(1) Rights to a subject invention in the U.S. may not be assigned without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Recipient;

(2) The Recipient will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;

(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Recipient with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific or engineering research or education; and

(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms and that it will give preference to a small business firm if the Recipient determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the Recipient is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Recipient. However, the Recipient agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Recipient's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Recipient will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures or practices with the Secretary when the Secretary's review discloses that the Recipient could take reasonable steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4).

Such request must be made in writhing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE approval, if given, will be based on a determination that this would best serve the national interest.

(e) Invention Identification, Disclosures, and Reports

(1) The Recipient shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Recipient personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this agreement. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, the Recipient shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.

(2) The Recipient shall disclose each subject invention to the DOE Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the Recipient becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Recipient. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the agreement under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Recipient shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Recipient. The report should also include any request for a greater rights determination in accordance with subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause.

(4) The Recipient agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Recipient each subject invention made under subaward/contract in order that the Recipient can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause.

(5) The Recipient agrees, subject to FAR 27.302(j), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.

(f) Examination of Records Relating to Inventions

(1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this agreement, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Recipient relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this agreement to determine whether-(i) Any such inventions are subject inventions; (ii) The Recipient has established and maintains the procedures required by subparagraphs (e)(1) and (4) of this clause; (iii) The Recipient and its inventors have complied with the procedures.

(2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Recipient invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Recipient may be required to disclose the invention to DOE for a determination of ownership rights.

(3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.

(g) Subaward/Contract

(1) The recipient shall include the clause PATENT RIGHTS (SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS) (suitably modified to identify the parties) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except where the work of the subaward/contract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE. In all other subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work, the Recipient shall include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties), or an alternate clause as directed by the contracting officer. The Recipient shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subaward/contract, obtain rights in the subrecipient's/contractor's subject inventions.

(2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subrecipient/contractor to accept such a clause the Recipient: (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subrecipient/contractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and (ii) Shall not proceed with such subaward/contract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

(3) In the case of subawards/contracts at any tier, DOE, the subrecipient/contractor, and Recipient agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subrecipient/contractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause.

(4) The Recipient shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subaward/contract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subrecipient/contractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subaward/contract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Recipient shall furnish a copy of such subaward/contract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subawards/contracts that have been awarded.

(5) The Recipient shall identify all subject inventions of a subrecipient/contractor of which it acquires knowledge in the performance of this agreement and shall notify the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the contracting officer, promptly upon identification of the inventions.

(h) Atomic Energy

(1) No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, shall be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this agreement.

(2) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Recipient will obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (h)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this agreement, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.

(i) Publication

It is recognized that during the course of the work under this agreement, the Recipient or its employees may from time to time desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this agreement. In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interests of DOE or the Recipient, patent approval for release of publication shall be secured from Patent Counsel prior to any such release or publication.

(j) Forfeiture of Rights in Unreported Subject Inventions

(1) The Recipient shall forfeit and assign to the Government, at the request of the Secretary of Energy or designee, all rights in any subject invention which the Recipient fails to report to Patent Counsel within six months after the time the Recipient: (i) Files or causes to be filed a United States or foreign patent application thereon; or (ii) Submits the final report required by subparagraph (e)(3) of this clause, whichever is later.

(2) However, the Recipient shall not forfeit rights in a subject invention if, within the time specified in subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Recipient: (i) Prepares a written decision based upon a review of the record that the invention was neither conceived nor first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the agreement and delivers the decision to Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, or (ii) Contending that the invention is not a subject invention, the Recipient nevertheless discloses the invention and all facts pertinent to this contention to the Patent Counsel, with a copy of the Contracting Officer; or (iii) Establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from the Recipient's fault or negligence.

(3) Pending written assignment of the patent application and patents on a subject invention determined by the Secretary of Energy or designee to be forfeited (such determination to be a final decision under the Disputes clause of this agreement), the Recipient shall be deemed to hold the invention and the patent applications and patents pertaining thereto in trust for the Government. The forfeiture provision of this paragraph (j) shall be in addition to and shall not supersede other rights and remedies which the Government may have with respect to subject inventions.

(iv) Establish claim to copyright subsisting in data first produced in the performance of this agreement to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause.

(c) Copyright

(1) Data first produced in the performance of this agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this agreement, the Recipient may establish, without the prior approval of the Contracting Officer, claim to copyright subsisting in any data first produced in the performance of this agreement. If claim to copyright is made, the Recipient shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including agreement number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. For such copyrighted data, including computer software, the Recipient grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government, for all such data.

(2) Data not first produced in the performance of this agreement. The Recipient shall not, without prior written permission of the Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this agreement any data that are not first produced in the performance of this agreement and that contain the copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, unless the Recipient identifies such data and grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause; provided, however, that if such data are computer software, the Government shall acquire a copyright license as set forth in paragraph (h)(3) of this clause if included in this agreement or as otherwise may be provided in a collateral agreement incorporated or made a part of this agreement.

(3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government agrees not to remove any copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph (c), and to include such notices on all reproductions of the data.

(d) Release, Publication and Use of Data

(1) The Receipt shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Recipient in the performance of this contract, except to the extent such data may be subject to the Federal export control or national security laws or regulations, or unless otherwise provided in this paragraph of this clause or expressly set forth in this contract.

(2) The Recipient agrees that to the extent it receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this agreement which contain restrictive markings, the Recipient shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless otherwise specifically authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer.

(e) Unauthorized Marking of Data

(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this agreement are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this clause and use of such is not authorized by this clause, or if such data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this agreement, the Contracting Officer may at any time either return the data to the Recipient or cancel or ignore the markings. However, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.

(i) The Contracting Officer shall make written inquiry to the Recipient affording the Recipient 30 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings;

(ii) If the Recipient fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 30-day period (or a longer time not exceeding 90 days approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions.

(iii) If the Recipient provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in subdivision (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Recipient shall be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer shall furnish the Recipient a written determination, which determination shall become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Recipient files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government shall continue to abide by the markings under this subdivision (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination become final (in which instance the Government shall thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.

(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.

(f) Omitted or Incorrect Markings

####### g

(1) Data delivered to the Government without either the limited rights or restricted rights notice as authorized by paragraph () of this clause, or the copyright notice required by paragraph (c) of this clause, shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. However, to the extent the data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Recipient may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown) after delivery of such data, permission to have notices placed on qualifying data at the Recipient's expense, and the Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Recipient-

(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;

(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;

(iii) Establishes that the use of the proposed notice is authorized; and

(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability with respect to the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any such data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.

(2) The Contracting Officer may also:

(i) Permit correction at the Recipient's expense of incorrect notices if the Recipient identifies the data on which correction of the notice is to be made, and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or

(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.

(g) Rights to Protected Data

(1) The Recipient may, with the concurrence of DOE, claim and mark as protected data, any data first produced in the performance of this award that would have been treated as a trade secret if developed at private expense. Any such claimed "protected data" will be clearly marked with the following Protected Rights Notice, and will be treated in accordance with such Notice, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause.

These protected data were produced under agreement no. ______ with the U.S. Department of Energy and may not be published, disseminated, or disclosed to others outside the Government until (Note:) The period of protection of such data is fully negotiable, but cannot exceed the applicable statutorily authorized maximum), unless express written authorization is obtained from the recipient. Upon expiration of the period of protection set forth in this Notice, the Government shall have unlimited rights in this data. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data, in whole or in part.

(2) Any such marked Protected Data may be disclosed under obligations of confidentiality for the following purposes:

(a) For evaluation purposes under the restriction that the "Protected Data" be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; or

(b) To subcontractors or other team members performing work under the Government's (insert name of program or other applicable activity) program of which this award is a part, for information or use in connection with the work performed under their activity, and under the restriction that the Protected Data be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed.

(3) The obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on publication and dissemination shall end for any Protected Data.

(a) At the end of the protected period;

(b) If the data becomes publicly known or available from other sources without a breach of the obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Protected Data;

(c) If the same data is independently developed by someone who did not have access to the Protected Data and such data is made available without obligations of confidentiality; or

(d) If the Recipient disseminates or authorizes another to disseminate such data without obligations of confidentiality.

(4) However, the Recipient agrees that the following types of data are not considered to be protected and shall be provided to the Government when required by this award without any claim that the data are Protected Data. The parties agree that notwithstanding the following lists of types of data, nothing precludes the Government from seeking delivery of additional data in accordance with this award, or from making publicly available additional non-protected data, nor does the following list constitute any admission by the Government that technical data not on the list is Protected Data. (Note: It is expected that this paragraph will specify certain types of mutually agreed upon data that will be available to the public and will not be asserted by the recipient/contractor as limited rights or protected data).

(5) The Government's sole obligation with respect to any protected data shall be as set forth in this paragraph (g).

(h) Protection of Limited Rights Data

When data other than that listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this agreement and such data qualify as either limited rights data or restricted computer software, the Recipient, if the Recipient desires to continue protection of such data, shall withhold such data and not furnish them to the Government under this agreement. As a condition to this withholding the Recipient shall identify the data being withheld and furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof.

(i) Subaward/Contract

The Recipient has the responsibility to obtain from its subrecipients/contractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Recipient's obligations to the Government under this agreement. If a subrecipient/contractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government such rights, the Recipient shall promptly bring such refusal to the attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with subaward/contract award without further authorization.

(j) Additional Data Requirements

In addition to the data specified elsewhere in this agreement to be delivered, the Contracting Officer may, at any time during agreement performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this agreement, order any data first produced or specifically used in the performance of this agreement. This clause is applicable to all data ordered under this subparagraph. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall require the Recipient to deliver any data the withholding of which is authorized by this clause or data which are specifically identified in this agreement as not subject to this clause. When data are to be delivered under this subparagraph, the Recipient will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery.

(k) The Recipient agrees, except as may be otherwise specified in this agreement for specific data items listed as not subject to this paragraph, that the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative may, up to three years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this contract, inspect at the Recipient's facility any data withheld pursuant to paragraph (h) of this clause, for purposes of verifying the Recipient's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. Where the Recipient whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.

As prescribed in 2 CFR 910.362(e)(2), the following Alternate I and/or II may be inserted in the clause in the award instrument.

(h)(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such data is so required, the Recipient may affix the following "Limited Rights Notice" to the data and the Government will thereafter treat the data, in accordance with such Notice:

(a) These data are submitted with limited rights under Government agreement No.______ (and subaward/contract No. ______, if appropriate). These data may be reproduced and used by the Government with the express limitation that they will not, without written permission of the Recipient, be used for purposes of manufacture nor disclosed outside the Government; except that the Government may disclose these data outside the Government for the following purposes, if any, provided that the Government makes such disclosure subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure:

(1) Use (except for manufacture) by Federal support services contractors within the scope of their contracts;

(2) This "limited rights data" may be disclosed for evaluation purposes under the restriction that the "limited rights data" be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed;

(3) This "limited rights data" may be disclosed to other contractors participating in the Government's program of which this Recipient is a part for information or use (except for manufacture) in connection with the work performed under their awards and under the restriction that the "limited rights data" be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed;

(4) This "limited rights data" may be used by the Government or others on its behalf for emergency repair or overhaul work under the restriction that the "limited rights data" be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; and

(5) Release to a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, as the interests of the United States Government may require, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by such government. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data in whole or in part.

(b) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of these data, in whole or in part.

(h)(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of restricted computer software, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of restricted computer software that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such computer software is so required, the Recipient may affix the following "Restricted Rights Notice" to the computer software and the Government will thereafter treat the computer software, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause, in accordance with the Notice:

(a) This computer software is submitted with restricted rights under Government Agreement No.______ (and subaward/contract ______, if appropriate). It may not be used, reproduced, or disclosed by the Government except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Notice or as otherwise expressly stated in the agreement.

(b) This computer software may be-

(1) Used or copied for use in or with the computer or computers for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which such computer or computers may be transferred;

(2) Used or copies for use in a backup computer if any computer for which it was acquired is inoperative

(3) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;

(4) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, provided that the modified, combined, or adapted portions of the derivative software are made subject to the same restricted rights;

(5) Disclosed to and reproduced for use by Federal support service Contractors in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this clause, provided the Government makes such disclosure or reproduction subject to these restricted rights; and

(6) Used or copies for use in or transferred to a replacement computer.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this computer software is published copyrighted computer software, it is licensed to the Government, without disclosure prohibitions, with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause.

(d) Any other rights or limitations regarding the use, duplication, or disclosure of this computer software are to be expressly stated in, or incorporated in, the agreement.

(e) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this computer software, in whole or in part.

(ii) Where it is impractical to include the Restricted Rights Notice on restricted computer software, the following short-form Notice may be used in lieu thereof:

Use, reproduction, or disclosure is subject to restrictions set forth in Agreement No.______ (and subaward/contract_________, if appropriate) with______ (name of Recipient and subrecipient/contractor).

(iii) If restricted computer software is delivered with the copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401, it will be presumed to be published copyrighted computer software licensed to the Government without disclosure prohibitions, with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, unless the Recipient includes the following statement with such copyright notice: "Unpublished-rights reserved under the Copyright Laws of the United States."

##### Subpart E - Cost Principles

###### § 910.401 Application to M&O's.

In accordance with 48 CFR 970.3002-1 and 970.3101-00-70, a Federally Funded Research Center (FFRDC) which is also a designated DOE Management and Operating (M&O) contract must follow the cost accounting standards (CAS) contained in 48 CFR part 30 and must follow the appropriate Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR part 31.

##### Subpart F - Audit Requirements for For-Profit Entities

###### General

####### § 910.500 Purpose.

This Part follows the same format as 2 CFR 200.500. We purposely did not renumber the paragraphs within this part so that auditors and recipients can compare this to the single audit requirements contained in 2 CFR 200.500.

###### Audits

####### § 910.501 Audit requirements.

######## Audit required.

(a)A for-profit entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in DOE awards must have a compliance audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this Part.

######## Compliance audit.

(b)(1) If a for-profit entity has one or more DOE awards with expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, they must have a compliance audit for each of the awards with $750,000 or more in expenditures. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514-Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit.

######## i.e.,

(2) If a for-profit entity receives more than one award from DOE with a sum total of expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, but does not have any single award with expenditures of $750,000 or more; the entity must determine whether any or all of the awards have common compliance requirements (are considered a cluster of awards) and determine the total expenditures of the awards with common compliance requirements. A compliance audit is required for the largest cluster of awards (if multiple clusters of awards exist) or the largest award not in a cluster of awards, whichever corresponding expenditure total is greater. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514-Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit;

(3) If a for-profit entity receives one or more awards from DOE with a sum total of expenditures less than $750,000, no compliance audit is required;

(4) If the for-profit entity is a sub-recipient, 2 CFR 200.501(h) requires that the pass-through entity establish appropriate monitoring and controls to ensure the sub-recipient complies with award requirements. These compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.514 Scope of audit

######## Program-specific audit election.

(c)Not applicable.

######## Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000.

(d)A for-profit entity that expends less than $750,000 during the for-profit's fiscal year in DOE awards is exempt from DOE audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).

######## Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).

(e)Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.

######## Subrecipients and Contractors.

(f)An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. The provisions of 2 CFR 200.331, Subrecipient and contractor determinations should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.

######## Compliance responsibility for contractors.

(g)In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.

######## For-profit subrecipient.

(h)Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients to DOE Federal award requirements. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for- profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits. See also 2 CFR 200.332, Requirements for pass- through entities.

####### § 910.502 Basis for determining DOE awards expended.

######## Determining Federal awards expended.

(a)The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the DOE award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards, such as: Expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the for-profit entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.

######## Loan and loan guarantees (loans).

(b)Loan and loan guarantees issued by the DOE Loan Program Office corresponding to Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 16511-16516 ("Title XVII") are exempt from these provisions.

(1) Not applicable.

(2) Not applicable.

(3) Not applicable.

(c) Not applicable.

######## Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).

(d)See paragraph (b) of this section.

######## Endowment funds.

(e)The cumulative balance of DOE awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered DOE awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.

######## Free rent.

(f)Free rent received by itself is not considered a DOE award expended under this Part. However, free rent received as part of a DOE award to carry out a DOE program must be included in determining DOE awards expended and subject to audit under this part.

######## Valuing non-cash assistance.

(g)DOE non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by DOE.

(h) Not applicable.

(i) Not applicable.

(j) Not applicable.

####### § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements.

(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this Part must be in lieu of any financial audit of DOE awards which a for-profit entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides DOE with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, DOE must rely upon and use that information.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, DOE, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this Part do not authorize any for-profit entity to constrain, in any manner, DOE from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that DOE must plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of DOE. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed, by other auditors.

(c) The provisions of this Part do not limit the authority of DOE to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of DOE awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official.

(d) DOE to pay for additional audits. If DOE conducts or arranges for additional audits it must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.

(e) Not applicable.

####### § 910.504 Frequency of audits.

Audits required by this Part must be performed annually.

(a) Not applicable.

(b) Not applicable.

####### § 910.505 Sanctions.

In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, DOE and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 CFR 200.339, Remedies for noncompliance.

####### § 910.506 Audit costs.

See 2 CFR 200.425 Audit services.

####### § 910.507 Compliance audits.

######## Program-specific audit guide available.

(a)In some cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal controls, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. A listing of current program-specific audit guides can be found on the OMB website in the compliance supplement, in part 8, appendix VI, Program-Specific Audit Guides, which includes a website where a copy of the guide can be obtained. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor must follow generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) and the guide when performing a compliance audit.

######## Program-specific audit guide not available.

(b)(1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor must conduct the compliance audit in accordance with GAAS and GAGAS.

(2) If audited financial statements are available, for-profit recipients should submit audited financial statements to DOE as a part of the compliance audit. (If the recipient is a subsidiary for which separate financial statements are not available, the recipient may submit the financial statements of the consolidated group.)

(3) The auditor must:

(i) Not applicable;

(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal controls and perform tests of internal controls over the DOE program consistent with the requirements of § 910.514 Scope of audit;

(iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards that could have a direct and material effect on the DOE program consistent with the requirements of § 910.514 Scope of audit;

(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding; and

(v) Report any audit findings consistent with the requirements of § 910.516 Audit findings.

(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

(i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) (if available) of the DOE program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;

(ii) A report on internal control related to the DOE program, which must describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;

(iii) A report on compliance which includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards which could have a direct and material effect on the DOE program; and

(iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the DOE program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the DOE program in a format consistent with § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (d)(3).

######## Report submission for program-specific audits.

(c)(1) The audit must be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. Unless restricted by Federal law or regulation, the auditee must make report copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

(2) When a program-specific audit guide is available, the compliance audits must be submitted (along with audited financial statements if audited financial statements are available), to the appropriate DOE Contracting Officer as well as to the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

(3) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the reporting package for a program-specific audit must consist of, a summary schedule of prior audit findings, and a corrective action plan as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the auditor's report(s) described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The compliance audit must be submitted (along with audited financial statements if audited financial statements are available), to the appropriate DOE Contracting Officer as well as to the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the for-profit entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in 2 CFR 200.321 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.

######## Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.

(b)An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this Part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.

######## Use of Federal auditors.

(c)Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this Part if they comply fully with the requirements of this Part.

####### § 910.510 Financial statements.

######## Financial statements.

(a)If available, the auditee must submit financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this Part. However, for-profit entity-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 910.514 Scope of audit, paragraph (a) and prepare separate financial statements.

######## Schedule of expenditures of DOE awards.

(b)The auditee must prepare a schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for the period covered by the auditee's fiscal year which must include the total DOE awards expended as determined in accordance with § 910.502 Basis for determining DOE awards expended. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by DOE and pass- through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a DOE program has multiple DOE award years, the auditee may list the amount of DOE awards expended for each DOE award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:

(1) List individual DOE programs. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual DOE programs within the cluster of programs. For R&D, total DOE awards expended must be shown by individual DOE award and major subdivision within DOE. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.

(2) Not applicable.

(3) Provide total DOE awards expended for each individual DOE program and the CFDA number For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.

(4) Not applicable.

(5) Not applicable.

(6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the for-profit entity elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in 2 CFR 200.414 Indirect (F&A) costs.

####### § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up.

######## General.

(a)The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

######## Summary schedule of prior audit findings.

(b)The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.

(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in DOE's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.

(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:

(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to DOE;

(ii) DOE is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and

(iii) A management decision was not issued.

######## Corrective action plan.

(c)At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 910.516 Audit findings, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.

####### § 910.512 Report submission.

######## General.

(a)(1) The audit must be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.

(2) Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.

######## Data collection.

(b)See paragraph (b)(1) of this section:

######## e.g.,

(1) A senior level representative of the auditee (director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the reporting package that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of this Part, the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information, and the information included in its entirety is accurate and complete.

(2) Not applicable.

(3) Not applicable.

######## Reporting package.

(c)The reporting package must include the:

(1) Financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards discussed in § 910.510 Financial statements, paragraphs (a) and (b), respectively;

(2) Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (b);

(3) Auditor's report(s) discussed in § 910.515 Audit reporting; and

(4) Corrective action plan discussed in § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (c).

######## Submission to DOE.

(d)The auditee must electronically submit the compliance reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section compliance audits must be submitted (along with audited financial statements if audited financial statements are available), to the appropriate DOE Contracting Officer as well as to the DOE Office of the Chief Financial Officer.

######## Requests for management letters issued by the auditor.

(e)In response to requests by a Federal agency, auditees must submit a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor.

######## Report retention requirements.

(f)Auditees must keep one copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section on file for three years from the date of submission to DOE.

###### Auditors

####### § 910.514 Scope of audit.

######## General.

(a)The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered DOE awards during such audit period, provided that each such audit must encompass the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a for-profit entity. The financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards must be for the same audit period.

######## Financial statements.

(b)If financial statements are available, the auditor must determine whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.

######## Internal control.

(c)(1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over DOE programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:

(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements; and

(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.

######## Compliance.

(d)(1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect.

(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.

(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.

(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.

######## Audit follow-up.

(e)The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up paragraph (b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor must perform audit follow-up procedures.

(f) Not applicable.

####### § 910.515 Audit reporting.

The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements (if available) are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements (if available) as a whole.

(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the DOE award, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control and compliance and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, it will refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) A report on compliance and report and internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance, include an opinion or modified opinion as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards which could have a direct and material effect and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:

(1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:

######## i.e.,

(i) The type of report the auditor issued (if applicable) on whether the financial statements (if available) audited were prepared in accordance with GAAP (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

(ii) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements (if available);

(iii) A statement (if applicable) as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements (if available) of the auditee;

(iv) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;

######## i.e.,

(v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);

(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a);

(vii) Not applicable.

(viii) Not applicable.

(ix) Not applicable.

(2) Findings relating to the financial Statements (if available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

(3) Findings and questioned costs for DOE awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a).

######## e.g.,

(i) Audit findings (internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding.

(ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (if available) and DOE awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.

(e) Nothing in this part precludes combining of the audit reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b), when allowed by GAGAS.

####### § 910.516 Audit findings.

######## Audit findings reported.

(a)The auditor must report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:

(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.

(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.

(3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.

######## e.g.,

(4) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a DOE program. which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this Part to perform audit procedures for such a DOE program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a DOE program that is not audited as a major program (as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.

(5) Not applicable.

(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a DOE award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for DOE awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to report publicly information which could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.

(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

######## Audit finding detail and clarity.

(b)Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for DOE to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:

(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, and Federal award identification number and year. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or DOE award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.

(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the DOE awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.

(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.

(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and DOE to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.

(6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable CFDA number(s) and applicable DOE award identification number(s).

(7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.

(8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.

(9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.

(10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.

######## Reference numbers.

(c)Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b) to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.

####### § 910.517 Audit documentation.

######## Retention of audit documentation.

(a)The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by DOE or the cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the audit documentation and reports.

######## Access to audit documentation.

(b)Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant agency for indirect cost, DOE, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this Part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation, as is reasonable and necessary.

####### § 910.518 [Reserved]

####### § 910.519 Criteria for Federal program risk.

######## General.

(a)The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the DOE program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular DOE program with auditee management and DOE.

######## Current and prior audit experience.

(b)(1) Weaknesses in internal control over DOE programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over DOE programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the DOE programs.

######## e.g.,

(i) A DOE program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. The auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.

(ii) When significant parts of a DOE program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.

(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a DOE program or have not been corrected.

(3) DOE programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.

######## Oversight exercised by DOE.

(c)(1) Oversight exercised by DOE could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.

(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.

######## Inherent risk of the Federal program.

(d)(1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation-personal services, but otherwise be at low risk.

(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.

(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.

(4) Programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

####### § 910.520 Criteria for a low-risk auditee.

An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods may qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage.

(a) Compliance audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart, including submitting the data collection form to DOE within the timeframe specified in § 910.512 Report submission. A for-profit entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.

(b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements (if available) were prepared in accordance with GAAP, or a basis of accounting required by state law, and the auditor's in relation to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards were unmodified.

(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.

(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.

(e) None of the DOE programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods:

(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control as required under § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (c);

(2) Not applicable.

(3) Not applicable.

###### Management Decisions

####### § 910.521 Management decision.

######## General.

(a)The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, DOE agency may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements (if they were available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.

(b) As provided in § 910.513 Responsibilities, paragraph (c)(3), DOE is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to DOE awards it makes to for-profit entities.

(c) Not applicable.

######## Time requirements.

(d)DOE must issue a management decision within six months of acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.

######## Reference numbers.

(e)Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings paragraph (c).

###### § 1104.110 Regulations governing DoD Components' award-specific terms and conditions.

On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200:

(a) The guidance in 2 CFR part 200 governs administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions used to supplement the general terms and conditions of a new grant or cooperative agreement awarded to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe.

(b) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.

###### § 1104.115 Regulations governing DoD Components' internal procedures.

On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, DoD Components' internal pre-award, time-of-award, and post-award procedures will continue to comply with requirements in parts 21 and 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 21 and 22) and other applicable Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) policies.

###### § 1104.120 Definitions.

####### DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations or DoDGARs

(a)means the regulations in chapter I, subchapter C of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, and chapter XI of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations.

####### Other terms.

(b)See part 1108 of the DoDGARs for definitions of other terms used in this part.

##### PARTS 1105-1107 [RESERVED]

##### PART 1108 - DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN SUBCHAPTERS A THROUGH F OF THIS CHAPTER

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 1108.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part provides:

(1) Definitions of terms used in subchapters A through F of this chapter; and

(2) Background information as context for understanding terms related to assistance and acquisition purposes, legal instruments that DoD Components make at the prime tier, and lower-tier transactions into which recipients and subrecipients enter when carrying out programs at lower tiers under DoD awards.

(b) This part is, for DoD, the regulatory implementation of OMB guidance in subpart A of 2 CFR part 200.

####### § 1108.2 Precedence of definitions of terms in national policy requirements.

######## General.

(a)Some portions of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) may use a term in relation to compliance with a national policy requirement in a statute, Executive order, or other source that defines the term differently than it is defined in subpart B of this part. For purposes of that particular national policy requirement, the definition of a term provided by the source of the requirement and any regulation specifically implementing it takes precedence over the definition in subpart B of this part. Using the definition of a term that takes precedence for each national policy requirement is therefore important when determining the applicability and effect of that requirement.

######## Examples.

(b)(1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:

(i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);

(ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;

(iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and

(iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.

(2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term "State" is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.

####### § 1108.3 Definitions of terms used in the Governmentwide cost principles or single audit requirements.

(a) Some DoDGARs provisions state that DoD Components or recipients must comply with single audit or cost principles requirements in a Governmentwide issuance that contains defined terms and include the requirements by reference to the issuance without restating them.

(b) For any term in one of those issuances, this part includes the definition of the term only if the DoDGARs also use that term directly.

######## i.e.,

(c) If the DoDGARs only use the term indirectly,through the DoDGARs' reference to the issuance, then this part will not include a definition and a user of the DoDGARs should consult definitions in the pertinent Governmentwide source, as follows:

(1) The Single Audit Act requirements for audits of recipients and subrecipients that are in subpart F of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200;

(2) The Governmentwide cost principles for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes that are contained in subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200; and

(3) The cost principles for for-profit entities at Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231.

####### § 1108.4 Definitions of terms that vary depending on context.

######## e.g.,,e.g.,

DoDGARs definitions of some terms related to types of legal instruments ("contract") and purposes for which they are used ("procurement" or "acquisition") may vary, depending on the context. Appendix A to this part provides additional information about those terms and their definitions.

###### Subpart B - Definitions

####### § 1108.10 Acquire.

######## Acquire

means to:

(a) When the term is used in connection with a DoD Component action at the prime tier, obtain property or services by purchase, lease, or barter for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government.

(b) When the term is used in connection with a recipient action or a subrecipient action at a tier under a DoD Component's award:

(1) Purchase services;

(2) Obtain property under the award by:

(i) Purchase;

(ii) Construction;

(iii) Fabrication;

(iv) Development;

######## i.e.,

(v) The recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property to the project or program under the award to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement (including within the entity's share of the award's project costs the value of the remaining life of the property or its fair market value, rather than charging depreciation); or

(vi) Otherwise.

####### § 1108.15 Acquisition.

######## Acquisition

means the process of acquiring as described in:

(a) Paragraph (a) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with DoD Component actions at the prime tier.

####### § 1108.20 Acquisition cost.

######## Acquisition cost

means the cost of an asset to a recipient or subrecipient, including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use.

(a) For example, when used in conjunction with:

(1) The purchase of equipment, the term means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.

(2) Equipment that a recipient or subrecipient constructs or fabricates-or software that it develops-under an award, the term includes, when capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):

(i) The construction and fabrication costs of that equipment; and

(ii) The development costs of that software.

(b) Ancillary charges, such as taxes, duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in, or excluded from, the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.

####### § 1108.35 Advanced research.

######## Advanced research,i.e.,

means advanced technology development that creates new technology or demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology to new products and processes in a general way. Advanced research is most closely analogous to precompetitive technology development in the commercial sector (early phases of research and development on which commercial competitors are willing to collaborate, because the work is not so coupled to specific products and processes that the results of the work must be proprietary). It does not include development of military systems and hardware where specific requirements have been defined. It is typically funded in Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.

####### § 1108.40 Agreements officer.

It typically is funded in Applied Research (Budget Activity 2) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. Applied research often follows basic research but may not be fully distinguishable from the related basic research. The term does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered for sale or acquisition, efforts that are within the definition of "development."

####### § 1108.50 Approved budget.

######## Approved budget

means, in conjunction with a DoD Component award to a recipient, the most recent version of the budget the recipient submitted, and the DoD Component approved (either at the time of the initial award or subsequently), to summarize planned expenditures for the project or program under the award. It includes:

(a) All Federal funding made available to the recipient under the award to use for project or program purposes.

######## Assistance

means the transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments that DoD Components use to provide assistance.

####### § 1108.60 Award.

######## Award

means a grant, cooperative agreement, technology investment agreement, or other nonprocurement instrument subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs. Within each part of the regulations, the term includes only the types of instruments subject to that part.

means efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. For the purposes of the DoDGARs, basic research includes:

(a) Research-related, science and engineering education and training, including graduate fellowships and research traineeships; and

(b) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.

####### § 1108.75 Capital asset.

######## Capital asset

means a tangible or intangible asset used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which is capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Capital assets include:

(a) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software) whether acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, lease-purchase, exchange, or through capital leases; and

(b) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life (not ordinary repairs and maintenance).

####### § 1108.80 Claim.

######## Claim

means a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to an award seeking as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of an award term or condition, or other relief arising under or relating to the award. A routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted to a claim by written notice to the grants or agreements officer if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

####### § 1108.85 Cognizant agency for indirect costs.

######## Cognizant agency for indirect costs

means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs for a particular entity may be different than the cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for indirect costs:

means a legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, reflects a relationship between the Federal Government and a State, a local government, or other recipient when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government. A procurement contract is a prime-tier transaction and therefore distinct from a recipient's or subrecipient's "procurement transaction" or "contract" as defined in this subpart.

####### § 1108.305 Procurement transaction.

######## Procurement transaction

means a legal instrument by which a recipient or subrecipient purchases property or services it needs to carry out the project or program under its award or subaward, respectively. A procurement transaction is distinct both from "subaward" and "procurement contract," as those terms are defined in this subpart.

####### § 1108.310 Program income.

######## Program income

means gross income earned by a recipient or subrecipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of an award or subaward (during the period of performance unless the award or subaward specifies continuing requirements concerning disposition of program income after the end of that period).

(a) Program income includes, but is not limited to, income from:

(1) Fees for services performed;

(2) The use or rental of real or personal property for which the recipient or subrecipient is accountable under the award or subaward (whether acquired under the award or subaward, or other Federal awards from which accountability for the property was transferred);

(3) The sale of commodities or items fabricated under the award or subaward;

(4) License fees and royalties on patents and copyrights; and

(5) Payments of principal and interest on loans made with award or subaward funds.

(b) Program income does not include:

(1) Interest earned on advances of Federal funds;

(2) Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment under the award; or

(3) Unless otherwise specified in Federal statute or regulation, or the terms and conditions of the award or subaward:

(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; or

(ii) Governmental revenues, taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues raised by the recipient or subrecipient.

######## Project costs

means the total of:

(a) Allowable costs incurred under an award by the recipient, including costs of any subawards and contracts under the award; and

(b) Cost-sharing or matching contributions that are required under the award, which includes voluntary committed (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions and the value of any third-party in-kind contributions.

####### § 1108.320 Property.

######## Property

means real property and personal property (equipment, supplies, intangible property, and debt instruments), unless stated otherwise.

####### § 1108.335 Research.

######## Research

means basic, applied, and advanced research.

####### § 1108.340 Simplified acquisition threshold.

######## Simplified acquisition threshold

means the dollar amount set by the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR subpart 2.1, which is adjusted periodically for inflation in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1908.

####### § 1108.345 Small award.

######## Small award

means a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subaward with a total value over the life of the award that does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

####### § 1108.350 State.

######## State,

for purposes of applying the administrative requirements in these regulations, means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any agency or instrumentality thereof exclusive of local governments.

####### § 1108.355 Subaward.

######## Subaward

means a legal instrument by which a recipient or subrecipient at any tier transfers-for performance by an entity at the next lower tier-a portion of the substantive program for which the DoD Component made an award.

####### § 1108.360 Subrecipient.

######## Subrecipient

means an entity that receives a subaward.

####### § 1108.365 Supplies.

######## Supplies

means all tangible personal property, including computing devices, acquired under an award that does not meet the definition of equipment in this subpart.

####### § 1108.370 Suspension.

######## Suspension

means either:

(a) When used in the context of a specific award or subaward, the temporary withdrawal of authority for that recipient or subrecipient to obligate funds under the award or subaward, pending its taking corrective action or a decision to terminate the award or subaward.

(b) When used in the context of an entity, an action by a DoD Component's suspending official under 2 CFR part 1125, DoD's regulation implementing OMB guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension in 2 CFR part 180, to immediately exclude the entity from participating in covered Federal Government transactions, pending completion of an investigation and any legal or debarment proceedings that ensue.

####### § 1108.375 Technology investment agreement.

######## Technology investment agreement

means one of a special class of assistance instruments used to increase involvement of commercial firms in defense research programs and for other purposes related to integration of the commercial and defense sectors of the nation's technology and industrial base. Technology investment agreements include one kind of cooperative agreement with provisions tailored for involving commercial firms, as well as one kind of assistance transaction other than a grant or cooperative agreement. Technology investment agreements are subject to, and described more fully in, 32 CFR part 37.

####### § 1108.380 Termination.

######## Termination

means the ending of an award or subaward, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the planned end of period of performance.

####### § 1108.385 Third-party in-kind contribution.

######## Third-party in-kind contribution,i.e.,

means the value of a non-cash contribution (property or services) that:

(a) A non-Federal third party contributes, without charge, either to a recipient or subrecipient at any tier under a DoD Component's award; and

(b) Is identified and included in the approved budget of the DoD Component's award, as a contribution being used toward meeting the award's cost-sharing or matching requirement (which includes voluntary committed, but not voluntary uncommitted, contributions).

####### § 1108.400 Unobligated balance.

######## Unobligated balance

means the amount of funds under an award or subaward that the recipient or subrecipient has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the recipient's or subrecipient's unliquidated obligations and expenditures of funds from the cumulative amount of funds that it was authorized to obligate under the award or subaward.

####### § 1108.405 Voluntary (committed or uncommitted) cost sharing.

######## Voluntary cost sharing,i.e.,

(a)means cost sharing that an entity pledges voluntarily in its application (not due to a stated cost-sharing requirement in the notice of funding opportunity to which the entity's application responds).

######## Voluntary committed cost sharing

(b)means voluntary cost sharing that a DoD Component accepts through inclusion in the approved budget for the project or program and as a binding requirement of the terms and conditions of the award made to the entity in response to its application.

######## Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing

(c)means voluntary cost sharing that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.

####### § 1108.410 Working capital advance.

######## Working capital advance

means a payment method under which funds are advanced to a recipient or subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given initial period, after which the DoD component making the award makes payment to the recipient or subrecipient by way of reimbursement.

###### Appendix A to Part 1108 - Background on Assistance, Acquisition, and Terms for Types of Legal Instruments

This appendix provides background intended to clarify some terms:

A. That are used in this chapter to describe either types of legal instruments that DoD Components, recipients, and subrecipients issue, or the purposes for which those types of instruments are used; and

B. For which this part provides definitions that vary depending on the context within which the terms are used.

A. The DoDGARs contain both:

1. Direction to DoD Components concerning their award of grants and cooperative agreements at the prime tier; and

2. Terms and conditions that DoD Components include in their grants and cooperative agreements to specify the Government's and recipients' rights and responsibilities, including post-award requirements with which recipients' actions must comply.

B. In some cases, the same defined term or two closely related terms are used in relation to both DoD Component actions at the prime tier and recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers under DoD Components' awards. But a given defined term may have meanings that differ at the two tiers. For example, in part because the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act applies to DoD Component actions at the prime tier but not to recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers (see sections III and IV of this appendix):

1. The terms "acquire" and "acquisition" do not have precisely the same meaning in conjunction with actions at the prime and lower tiers.

2. The meaning of the term "procurement contract" used to describe DoD Component prime-tier actions is not precisely the same as the meaning of "procurement transaction" or "contract" used to describe recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers.

A. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. chapter 63) specifies that the type of legal instrument a DoD Component is to use is based on the nature of the relationship between the DoD Component and the recipient.

B. Specifically, except where another statute authorizes DoD to do otherwise, 31 U.S.C. chapter 63 specifies use of:

1. A procurement contract as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between a DoD Component and a recipient when the principal purpose of the relationship is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

2. A grant or cooperative agreement as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between those two parties when the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.

C. The terms "acquisition" and "assistance" are defined in this part to correspond to the principal purposes described in paragraphs III.B.1 and 2 of this section, respectively. Using those terms, paragraphs III.B.1 and B.2 may be restated to say that grants and cooperative agreements are assistance instruments that DoD Components use, as distinct from procurement contracts they use for acquisition.

A. While the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act applies to Federal agencies, it does not govern types of instruments that recipients and subrecipients of any tier use. That statute does not require a recipient or subrecipient to:

1. Consider any instrument it makes at a lower tier under a Federal assistance award to be a grant or cooperative agreement. Therefore, at its option, a recipient or subrecipient may consider all of its lower-tier instruments to be "contracts."

2. Associate an "assistance" relationship, as that term is defined in this part and used in this chapter, with any lower-tier transaction that it makes.

B. However, the DoDGARs in this chapter do distinguish between two classes of lower-tier transactions that recipients and subrecipients make: Subawards and procurement transactions. The distinction promotes uniformity in requirements for lower-tier transactions under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It is based on a long-standing distinction in OMB guidance to Federal agencies, currently at 2 CFR part 200, which DoD implements in this chapter.

C. The distinction between a subaward and procurement transaction is based on the primary purpose of that transaction.

1. The transaction is a subaward if a recipient or subrecipient enters into it with another entity at the next lower tier in order to transfer-for performance by that lower-tier entity-a portion of the substantive program for which the DoD grant or cooperative agreement provided financial assistance to the recipient. Because the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act does not apply to the recipient or subrecipient, it may make a subaward as defined in this part using an instrument that it considers a contract.

2. The transaction is a procurement transaction if the recipient or subrecipient enters into it in order to purchase goods or services from the lower-tier entity that the recipient or subrecipient needs to perform its portion of the substantive program supported by the DoD award.

#### Subchapter B [Reserved]

##### PARTS 1110-1119 [RESERVED]

#### Subchapter C - Award Format and National Policy Terms and Conditions for All Grants and Cooperative Agreements

##### PART 1120 - AWARD FORMAT FOR DOD GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS

###### Subpart A - Award Cover Pages

####### § 1120.100 Purpose of the award cover pages.

The award cover pages comprise the portion of each DoD Component award of a grant or cooperative agreement or modification to an award that the DoD Component transmits to the recipient when it makes the award or modification. It:

(a) Contains basic information about the award or modification and the recipient, as described in § 1120.105;

(b) Is signed by a DoD grants officer; and

(c) Also is signed by the recipient's authorized organizational representative if the award or modification is a bilateral action that is to be signed on behalf of both the DoD Component and recipient.

####### § 1120.105 Content of the award cover pages.

The award cover pages of each DoD Component grant or cooperative agreement or modification:

(a) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the award or modification:

(1) The name of the DoD Component awarding office that made the award or modification.

(2) The award number (Federal Award Identification Number or FAIN) and, if the action is a modification, the modification number.

######## i.e.,

(3) The type of award-grant or cooperative agreement.

######## e.g.,,e.g.,

(4) The type of award action-new award, funding modification, or administrative (non-funding) modification. For an administrative modification, the award cover pages should include a brief description of the purpose of the modification (a no-cost extension of the end date of the period of performance).

(5) For a new award or funding modification:

(i) A brief description of the project or program supported by the award.

(ii) The amount of the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds due to the current action and any accompanying change in the total amount of cost sharing or matching required under the award.

######## i.e.,

(iii) The cumulative amounts of Federal funds and any corresponding non-Federal share obligated to date (the sums of the amounts of the current action and the cumulative amounts of prior obligations and deobligations).

(iv) The total amount of the project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, the Federal share of that amount, and the non-Federal share even if that share is "zero."

######## i.e.,

(v) The total value of the award; the Federal share of that total value (which includes Federal funding obligated to date; future incremental funding actions; and options for which amounts have been predetermined, whether or not they have been exercised yet); and the non-Federal share of that total value (total cost sharing or matching required under the award).

(vi) A table such as the following may be helpful in clearly presenting the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (vi) of this section:

######## i.e.,

(6) The obligation date (the date of the grants officer's signature) and, if different, the effective date.

(7) The start date and current end date of the period of performance.

(8) The statutory authority or authorities under which the award or modification was made.

(9) The number and title of the program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under which the award or modification was made.

(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):

(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or "cluster") of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).

######## i.e.,

(ii) What the award includes in addition to the cover pages-the:

(A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;

(B) Approved budget; and

(C) General, and any award specific, terms and conditions of the award.

(iii) Where the portions of the award listed in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section are located, which content the DoD Component generally should incorporate into the award by reference. When incorporating that content into the award by reference, the DoD Component must both:

(A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and

(B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.

######## e.g.,

(iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements (Federal statutes).

######## e.g.,

(v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award. If there are multiple individuals and offices for different post-award functions (payments and property administration), the award cover pages should provide information about each.

(vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.

(b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:

(1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

(2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or "doing business as" name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.

(3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.

(4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.

######## i.e.,

(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply-the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate-if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.

(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:

(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.

(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.

####### § 1120.110 Use of alternative to DoD form.

(a) A DoD Component may use something other than a DoD form as its award cover pages only if:

(1) There is not currently any DoD form for the award cover pages; or

(2) The DoD Component obtains approval for a deviation from the requirement to use a DoD form from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in accordance with the procedures specified in 32 CFR 21.340.

(b) If a DoD Component does not use a DoD form for its award cover pages, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, its award cover pages must include all information specified in § 1120.105.

###### Subpart B - Award-specific Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.200 Purpose and inclusion of award-specific terms and conditions.

A DoD Component must include with each award, for transmission to the recipient, any terms and conditions needed to communicate requirements specific to the individual award as distinct from the more broadly applicable requirements in the general terms and conditions. For a modification to an award, only changes to previously transmitted terms and conditions must be included.

####### § 1120.205 Organization and wording of award-specific terms and conditions.

DoD Components should organize and word award-specific terms and conditions to make them as clear and easy to understand as possible for the benefit of recipients, award administrators, auditors, and others who may need to use them. The DoDGARs specify neither a standard organization nor standard wording for award-specific terms and conditions.

###### Subpart C - General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.300 Purpose of general terms and conditions.

######## e.g.,

The general terms and conditions comprise the portion of the award with requirements that apply to a class of awards (awards under a particular program or type of program activity, such as research or education, or for a class of recipients, such as for-profit entities).

####### § 1120.305 Requirement for general terms and conditions.

Each DoD Component must establish at least one set of general terms and conditions. A DoD Component may have more than one set, as it deems appropriate to reflect differences in its award terms and conditions across different programs, classes of recipients, or types of activity.

####### § 1120.310 Use of plain language.

(a) DoD Components must use plain language in:

(1) General terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Those awards are subject to the DoDGARs provisions in:

(i) 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That standard wording uses personal pronouns.

(ii) 2 CFR part 1122, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing commonly applicable national policy requirements. That standard wording also uses personal pronouns.

(2) The national policy requirements in Subdivision B of general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities, which also are subject to 2 CFR part 1122.

(b) Although the DoDGARs currently do not provide standard wording for terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements for use in awards to for-profit entities, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to use plain language and personal pronouns in their terms and conditions of those other awards. The DoDGARs provisions that specify the administrative requirements to incorporate into those terms and conditions are listed in § 1120.510(b).

####### § 1120.315 Availability of general terms and conditions.

(a) A DoD Component that issues a funding opportunity announcement under which grants or cooperative agreements may be awarded must maintain on the internet the general terms and conditions for those awards if:

(1) The distribution of the funding opportunity announcement is unlimited; and

(2) The DoD Component anticipates making 10 or more awards per year using those general terms and conditions.

(b) Each DoD Component that maintains a set of general terms and conditions on the internet must also maintain an archive of previous versions of that set at the same internet location, for use by recipients, post-award administrators, auditors, and others. Each version must be labeled with its effective dates.

(c) If a DoD Component has a set of general terms and conditions that is not subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the DoD Component chooses not to maintain that set on the internet:

(1) It must tell potential applicants or proposers in the funding opportunity announcement, if there is one, how they may view or obtain a copy of the general terms and conditions; or

######## e.g.,

(2) If there is no funding opportunity announcement (if it is a noncompetitive program for which all recipients are known in advance), the DoD Component must provide the general terms and conditions to each recipient no later than the time of award.

###### Subpart D - Preamble to the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.400 Requirement to include a preamble.

Each DoD Component must include a preamble as Subdivision A of each set of general terms and conditions it maintains, to provide information to help recipients understand how to use those terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.405 Content of the preamble.

The preamble for each set of general terms and conditions must include at least the following information elements, organized in the order shown:

######## Table of contents.

(a)This should show the articles within each other subdivision of the general terms and conditions (Subdivisions B and C for administrative and national policy requirements and, if needed, Subdivision D for programmatic requirements).

######## Scope.

(b)This element identifies the programs, types of awards, and types of recipient entities that are subject to the set of general terms and conditions.

######## Effective date.

(c)This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions. The version date of each article within the general terms and conditions must be indicated in parentheses following the title of the article, to help a recipient identify the articles that changed from previous versions of the general terms and conditions.

######## English language.

(d)The purpose of this element of the preamble is to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.111(b) by informing each recipient that:

(1) It must translate any of the award content (including attachments to it and any material incorporated into the award by reference) into another language to the extent that the recipient's compliance with the award's terms and conditions depends upon a significant number of its employees who are not fluent in English being able to read and comprehend that content.

(2) If it does translate any award content into another language, either as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or at its own initiative, the original award content in the English language will take precedence in the event of an inconsistency between the award requirements in the English and translated versions.

######## Plain language.

(e)This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with § 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.

######## Definitions.

(f)Providing the definitions of words and phrases that are used in the general terms and conditions and defined in the DoDGARs is more helpful to recipients than referring them to the DoDGARs to find the definitions.

###### Subpart E - Administrative Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.500 Scope of administrative requirements.

The administrative requirements in an award are post-award and after-the-award requirements for recipients in the following subject matter areas:

(a) Financial and program management, to include financial management system standards, payment, allowable costs, program and budget revisions, audits, cost sharing or matching, and program income.

(b) Property administration, to include title vesting, property management system standards, and use and disposition of tangible and intangible property.

(c) Recipient procurement procedures.

(d) Financial, programmatic, property, and other reporting.

(e) Records retention and access, remedies, claims and disputes, and closeout.

####### § 1120.505 Location of administrative requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes administrative requirements as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.510 Sources of administrative requirements.

The source of administrative requirements is:

(a) Subchapter D of this chapter for cost-type grant and cooperative agreement awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Subchapter D provides a standard set of articles into which a DoD Component organizes the administrative requirements. It also provides standard wording for the general terms and conditions in those articles, as explained in the overview of subchapter D in 2 CFR part 1126.

(b) 32 CFR part 34 for grant and cooperative agreement awards to for-profit entities. That part of the DoDGARs specifies the administrative requirements for awards to those entities but does not provide standard articles or terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.515 Incorporation of administrative requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

(a) For cost-type awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements by:

(1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of administrative requirements provided in subchapter D of this chapter (the standard wording of the articles is in the appendices to 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138) into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

######## e.g.,

(2) Stating any variations from that standard wording (any sections or paragraphs that the DoD Component adds, revises, or omits, consistent with the DoDGARs prescription for use of the standard wording).

######## e.g.,

(b) Incorporating that standard wording into general terms and conditions by reference, rather than including the full text of each article of the general terms and conditions, will make it easier for those who must use terms and conditions of multiple DoD Components' awards (recipients, DoD Components' post-award administrators, and auditors) to quickly identify how each Component's general terms and conditions differ from the DoD standard wording.

###### Subpart F - National Policy Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.600 Scope of national policy requirements.

National policy requirements, as defined in 2 CFR 1122.2, are requirements:

(a) That are prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refer to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

(c) That are outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements, as described in § 1120.500.

####### § 1120.605 Location of national policy requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes national policy requirements as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.610 Source of national policy requirements.

The source of national policy requirements to be included in a grant or cooperative agreement is 2 CFR part 1122.

####### § 1120.615 Incorporation of national policy requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

For the same reason given in § 1120.515(b), DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements for awards to all types of recipient entities, including for-profit entities, by:

(a) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of national policy requirements provided in the appendices to 2 CFR part 1122 into those general terms and conditions by reference; and

######## e.g.,

(b) Stating any variations from that standard wording (any added, omitted, or revised paragraphs, based on which national policy requirements apply to programs and recipients for which the general terms and conditions are used).

###### Subpart G - Programmatic Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions

####### § 1120.700 Scope of programmatic requirements.

A requirement is most appropriately included in the programmatic requirements portion of the general terms and conditions if it:

(a) Is not in one of the subject matter areas covered by the administrative requirements in Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions, as described in § 1120.500.

(b) Does not meet the criteria in § 1120.600 for a national policy requirement.

(c) Broadly applies to awards using the general terms and conditions. Requirements that apply to relatively few of those awards are more appropriately included in the award-specific terms and conditions of the individual awards to which they apply.

(d) Is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future, rather than for a limited period of time. For example, a requirement in an annual appropriations act that applies specifically to funding made available by that act is better addressed through the award-specific terms and conditions of awards or modifications to which it applies.

####### § 1120.705 Location of programmatic requirements in the standard award format.

As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes programmatic requirements as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1120.710 Examples of programmatic requirements.

##### PART 1122 - NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - General

####### § 1122.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.

(b) It thereby implements:

(1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(2) National policy requirements, to the extent they apply, for general terms and conditions of DoD awards to for-profit firms, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities.

####### § 1122.2 Definition of "national policy requirement."

For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:

(a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;

(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

(c) That is outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements in subchapters D or E of this chapter.

####### § 1122.3 Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.

######## "

Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define "Statein ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.

###### Subpart B - Terms and Conditions

####### § 1122.100 Purpose of this subpart.

This subpart provides:

(a) Direction to DoD Components on how to construct the four articles of national policy requirements for inclusion in the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements.

(b) Standard wording for national policy requirements that are more commonly applicable to DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.

####### § 1122.105 Where to find the terms and conditions.

(a) Appendices A through D of this part provide standard wording of terms and conditions for the four articles of national policy requirements. The articles address the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the recipient related to those national policy requirements.

(b) The following table shows which national policy terms and conditions may be found in each appendix to this part:

####### § 1122.110 Organization of each article of national policy requirements.

Each of NP Articles I through IV includes two sections.

(a) Section A of each article includes national policy requirements that are cross-cutting in that their applicability extends to many or all DoD awards. Appendices A through D to this part provide standard wording for each of those requirements.

(b) Section B of each article is the location in the award for program-specific national policy requirements. Section B is reserved in the standard wording of the articles provided in appendices A through D to this part.

####### § 1122.115 Cross-cutting national policy requirements.

######## General requirement to include applicable cross-cutting requirements.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the standard wording provided in appendices A through D to this part for each national policy requirement addressed in Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV, respectively, that may apply either to:

(1) A recipient of an award using those general terms and conditions; or

(2) A subrecipient of a subaward under an award using those general terms and conditions.

######## Authority to reserve or omit inapplicable paragraphs.

(b)A DoD Component may reserve or omit any paragraph appendices A through D to this part provide for Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV of its general terms and conditions if it determines that the national policy requirement addressed in that paragraph will not apply to any awards using those terms and conditions nor to any subawards under them.

######## Authority to use alternate wording.

(c)(1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

(2) A DoD Component in that case:

(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.

(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.

####### § 1122.120 Other national policy requirements.

If a DoD Component determines that awards using its general terms and conditions, or subawards under them, are subject to a national policy requirement that is not addressed in the standard wording appendices A through D to this part provide for cross-cutting requirements, the DoD Component must include the requirement in its general terms and conditions. It should add the requirement in Section B of NP Article I, II, III, or IV, as most appropriate to the subject matter of the requirement.

###### Appendix A to Part 1122 - Terms and Conditions for NP Article I, "Nondiscrimination National Policy Requirements"

####### § 1125.930 Debarring official (DoD supplement to Governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.930).

DoD Components' debarring officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as debarring officials for procurement contracts.

####### § 1125.937 DoD Component.

In this part, DoD Component means the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a Military Department, a Defense Agency, a DoD Field Activity, or any other organizational entity of the Department of Defense that is authorized to award or administer grants, cooperative agreements, or other nonprocurement transactions.

####### § 1125.1010 Suspending official (DoD supplement to Governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.1010).

DoD Components' suspending officials for nonprocurement transactions are the same officials identified in 48 CFR part 209, subpart 209.4, as suspending officials for procurement contracts.

###### § 1125.10 What does this part do?

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Department of Defense (DoD) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the Department of Defense to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension" (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, "Debarment and Suspension" (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

###### § 1125.20 Does this part implement the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180 for all DoD nonprocurement transactions?

This part implements the OMB guidelines in 2 CFR part 180 for most DoD nonprocurement transactions. However, it does not implement the guidelines as they apply to prototype projects under the authority of Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), as amended. The Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy maintains a DoD issuance separate from this part that addresses section 845 transactions.

###### § 1125.30 Does this part apply to me?

This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a-

(a) Participant or principal in a "covered transaction" (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of "nonprocurement transaction" at 2 CFR 180.970, as supplemented by subpart B of this part), other than a section 845 transaction described in § 1125.20;

(b) Respondent in a DoD Component's nonprocurement suspension or debarment action;

(c) DoD Component's debarment or suspension official; or

(d) DoD Component's grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into a nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

###### § 1125.40 What policies and procedures must I follow?

####### General.

(a)You must follow the policies and procedures specified in applicable sections of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by this part.

####### Specific sections of OMB guidance that this part supplements.

(b)In implementing the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, this part supplements eight sections of the guidance, as shown in the following table. For each of those sections, you must follow the policies and procedures in the OMB guidance, as supplemented by this part.

####### Sections of the OMB guidance that this part does not supplement.

(c)For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that is not listed in paragraph (b) of this section, DoD policies and procedures are the same as those in the OMB guidance.

#### Subchapter D - Administrative Requirements Terms and Conditions for Cost-Type Grants and Cooperative Agreements to Nonprofit and Governmental Entities

##### PART 1126 - SUBCHAPTER D OVERVIEW

###### § 1126.1 Purposes of this subchapter.

This subchapter of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations:

(a) Addresses general terms and conditions governing administrative requirements for use by DoD Components when awarding cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. It does so by providing:

(1) A standard organization of the administrative requirements into articles of general terms and conditions, each of which is in a specific subject area.

(2) Standard wording for those articles; and

(3) Associated prescriptions for DoD Component's use of the standard wording to construct their general terms and conditions, which allow for adding, omitting, or varying in other ways from the standard wording in certain situations.

(b) Thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 as it relates to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

###### § 1126.2 Applicability of this subchapter.

####### Entities.

(a)This subchapter:

(1) Applies to DoD Components that award cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(2) Does not directly impose requirements on a recipient of a DoD Component's award but does do so indirectly, through the DoD Component's compliance with this subchapter when it constructs its general award terms and conditions. The terms and conditions delineate the rights and responsibilities of the recipient and the Federal Government under the award.

####### Awards.

(b)This subchapter applies to DoD Components' cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to types of entities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, other than Technology Investment Agreements that are addressed in 32 CFR part 37.

###### § 1126.3 Exceptions from requirements in this subchapter.

####### Exceptions that are not permitted.

(a)A DoD Component may not grant any exception to the requirements in this subchapter if the exception is:

(1) Prohibited by statute, executive order, or regulation;

(2) Inconsistent with the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

####### Other exceptions.

(b)Other exceptions are permitted from requirements in this subchapter for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes as follows:

####### Statutory or regulatory exceptions.

(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may incorporate a requirement that is inconsistent with the requirements in this subchapter if that requirement is specifically authorized or required by a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.

####### Individual exceptions.

(2)The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may approve an individual exception affecting only one award in accordance with procedures stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

####### Small awards.

(3)A DoD Component's terms and conditions for small awards may apply less restrictive requirements than those specified in this subchapter (a small award is an award for which the total value of obligated funding through the life of the award is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold).

####### Other class exceptions.

(4)The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering or his or her designee may approve any class exception affecting multiple awards other than small awards, with OMB concurrence if the class exception is for a requirement that is inconsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. Procedures for DoD Components' requests for class exceptions are stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

###### § 1126.4 Relationship to other portions of the DoD grant and agreement regulations.

The administrative requirements specified in this subchapter complement:

(a) Provisions of 32 CFR part 34 that address administrative requirements for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities; and

(b) Requirements in 32 CFR part 37 for technology investment agreements.

###### § 1126.5 Organization of this subchapter.

This subchapter is organized into six parts in addition to this overview part. Each part provides standard wording and prescriptions for articles of general terms and conditions that address administrative requirements in a particular subject area. Table 1 shows the subject area and articles corresponding to each part:

###### § 1126.6 Organization of the other parts of this subchapter.

(a) Each of parts 1128 through 1138 of this subchapter is organized into subparts and appendices.

(1) Each appendix provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for one of the articles of general terms and conditions that the part addresses.

(2) For each appendix addressing a particular article, the part has an associated subpart that provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording for that article.

(b) For example, Table 1 to § 1126.5 indicates that 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles I through VII and the prescriptions for DoD Components' use of that standard wording.

(1) FMS Article I on financial management system standards is the first of the articles that 2 CFR part 1128 covers. Appendix A to 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Article I. The associated subpart of 2 CFR part 1128, subpart A, provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording of that article.

(2) Appendices B through G of 2 CFR part 1128 provide the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles II through VII, respectively. The associated subparts, Subparts B through G, provide the corresponding prescriptions for DoD Components.

##### PART 1128 - RECIPIENT FINANCIAL AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Financial Management System Standards (FMS Article I)

####### § 1128.100 Purpose of FMS Article I.

FMS Article I specifies standards for recipients' financial management systems. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.302, 200.303, and 200.328; and

(b) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting.

####### § 1128.105 Content of FMS Article I.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for recipients' financial management systems.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for FMS Article I.

######## Exceptions.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

(i) Reserve Section A of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will receive:

(A) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or

(B) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.

######## e.g.,

(ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments (through unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between financial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve paragraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.

###### Subpart B - Payments (FMS Article II)

####### § 1128.200 Purpose of FMS Article II.

FMS Article II contains requirements related to payments under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305.

####### § 1128.205 Content of FMS Article II.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address payment method; payment timing and amounts, which relate to cash management; frequency of payment requests; and matters related to recipients' depositories, including interest earned on advance payments.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix B to this part provides for FMS Article II with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as described in §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220.

####### § 1128.210 Payment requirements for States.

######## Policy.

(a)Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:

(1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under "major programs," as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.

######## i.e.,

(2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States-awards that are not under major programs.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.

######## Exception for awards under major programs.

(2)If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:

(i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and

(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.

####### § 1128.215 Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

######## Policy.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements-advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

######## Advance payments.

(1)With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:

(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and

(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).

######## Reimbursement.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:

(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and

(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.

######## Alternative award terms and conditions.

(2)A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:

(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;

(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;

(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and

(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.

####### § 1128.220 Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.

######## Policy.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.

######## Award terms and conditions,Electronic funds transfer.

(b)-(1)Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.

######## Other payment procedures or instructions.

(2)A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.

###### Subpart C - Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit (FMS Article III)

####### § 1128.300 Purpose of FMS Article III.

FMS Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies what costs are allowable as charges to awards and when they are allowable. It also specifies restrictions on payment of fee or profit. It thereby implements OMB guidance in §§ 200.209 and 200.309 and Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.201(b)(1) and 200.323(c), as those sections apply to the cost principles to be used in relation to subawards and contracts, respectively.

####### § 1128.305 Content of FMS Article III.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address allowability of costs and permissibility of fee or profit.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for FMS Article III with appropriate reservations as described in §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325.

####### § 1128.310 Cost principles.

######## Policy.

(a)The set of Governmentwide cost principles applicable to a particular entity type governs the allowability of costs that may be:

(1) Charged to each cost-type:

(i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;

(ii) Subaward to a subrecipient of that entity type at any tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement; and

(iii) Procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type awarded by a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

(2) Considered in establishing the amount of any:

(i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under a grant or cooperative agreement, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or

(ii) Fixed-price procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type that is awarded by either a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Because almost all DoD grants and cooperative agreements are cost-type awards, appendix C includes wording for Section A of FMS Article III that specifies use of the applicable Governmentwide cost principles in the determination of the allowability of costs.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve any paragraph of appendix C's wording for Section A of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the Component is certain that no entities of the type to which the paragraph applies could be recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions or recipients of subawards or procurement transactions at any tier under those awards.

####### § 1128.315 Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge publication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article III.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using those general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.320 Period of availability of funds.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the period during which Federal funds are available for obligation by recipients for project or program purposes.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of FMS Article III to specify the period of availability of funds.

####### § 1128.325 Fee or profit.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients may neither receive fee or profit nor pay fee or profit to subrecipients.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of FMS Article III to specify the limitation on payment of fee or profit.

###### Subpart D - Revision of Budget and Program Plans (FMS Article IV)

####### § 1128.400 Purpose of FMS Article IV.

FMS Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to changes in recipients' budget and program plans. It thereby implements OMB guidance in § 200.308 of 2 CFR part 200 and partially implements § 200.209 and Subpart E of that part.

####### § 1128.405 Content of FMS Article IV.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the changes in budget and program plans for which a recipient is required to request DoD Component prior approval and the procedures for submitting those requests.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article IV the § wording appendix D to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.410 through 1128.430.

####### § 1128.410 Approved budget.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)As described in 2 CFR 200.308(a), the approved budget for a grant or cooperative agreement may include both the Federal and non-Federal shares of funding under the award or only the Federal share.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)For DoD grants and cooperative agreements, the approved budget includes the Federal share and any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must include the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of FMS Article IV.

####### § 1128.415 Prior approvals for non-construction activities.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.

######## DoD implementation of the guidance.,i.e.,

(b)The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

######## Scope or objective, cost sharing or matching, and additional Federal funds.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:

(1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).

(2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).

(3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).

######## Personnel changes, disengagements, or reductions in time.

(d)A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:

(1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).

(2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).

######## Costs requiring prior approval under the cost principles.

(e)With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):

(1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.

(2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:

(i) Which, if any, to waive; and

######## e.g.,

(ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions (a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).

######## Transfers of funds and subawards.

(f)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:

(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).

(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).

(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.

######## Pre-award costs, carry forward of unobligated balances, and no-cost extensions.

(g)(1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.

(2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.

######## e.g.,

(3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies (the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(h)Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:

(1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.

(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.

(3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).

######## e.g.,

(4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section (to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).

(5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.

####### § 1128.420 Prior approvals for construction activities.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction grant or cooperative agreement or construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction activities.

######## DoD implementation of the guidance.,i.e.,

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) through terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or awards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:

(1) Must include the wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.

(2) May reserve or remove the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C of FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction activities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as Section C).

####### § 1128.425 Additional prior approval for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)Guidance on an additional prior approval requirement for grants or cooperative agreements that support both construction and non-construction activities is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5).

######## DoD implementation of the guidance.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5) through terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)If a DoD Component establishes general terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities, the DoD Component may add the prior approval requirement for funding or budget transfers between construction and non-construction activities that is described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5). The wording that appendix D to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article IV includes a reserved paragraph B.3 in which the DoD Component may add appropriate wording to include that prior approval requirement.

####### § 1128.430 Procedures for prior approvals.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)Guidance on procedures related to recipient requests for prior approval is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i).

######## DoD implementation of the guidance.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i) for prior approval requests through award terms and conditions.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component must:

(1) Include the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph D.1 of FMS Article IV of its general terms and conditions.

(2) Insert appropriate wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph D.2 that appendix D to this part includes in FMS Article IV to specify:

(i) The format the recipient must use when it requests approval for budget revisions. As described in 2 CFR 200.308(h), the award term may allow the recipient to submit a letter of request or otherwise must specify that the recipient use the same format it used for budget information in its application or proposal.

######## e.g.,

(ii) Any other procedural instructions related to requests for prior approvals for budget or program revisions (to whom requests must be submitted) that are common to the awards using the general terms and conditions. For procedural instructions that will vary from one award to another, it is appropriate to include wording that points to the award-specific terms and conditions as the source of the information.

###### Subpart E - Non-Federal Audits (FMS Article V)

####### § 1128.500 Purpose of FMS Article V.

FMS Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to audits required under the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C., chapter 75). The article thereby implements for grants and cooperative agreements the OMB guidance in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.

####### § 1128.505 Content of FMS Article V.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address audit requirements.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix E to this part provides for FMS Article V.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the wording in appendix E if there will be no subawards to for-profit entities under any award using those terms and conditions.

###### Subpart F-Cost Sharing or Matching (FMS Article VI)

####### § 1128.600 Purpose of FMS Article VI.

FMS Article VI sets forth requirements concerning recipients' cost sharing or matching under awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.306 and 200.308(c)(1)(vii); and

(b) 2 CFR 200.434, in conjunction with FMS Article III in appendix C to this part.

####### § 1128.605 Content of FMS Article VI.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards under which there may be required cost sharing or matching must specify the criteria for determining allowability, methods for valuation, and requirements for documentation of cost sharing or matching.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VI the wording appendix F to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve FMS Article VI of its general terms and conditions if it determines that there will be no cost sharing or matching required under any of the awards using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.610 General requirement for cost sharing or matching.

######## Requirement.

(a)(1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:

(i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover pages.

(ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any that involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.

(iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of cost share or match.

######## e.g.,

(2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific contributions included in the approved budget (to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the approved budget).

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS Article VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require recipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

####### § 1128.615 General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost sharing or matching under grants and cooperative agreements.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the allowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms and conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to accept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.620 Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides that unrecovered indirect costs may only be included as part of cost sharing and matching with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)DoD Components must allow any recipient that either has an approved negotiated indirect cost rate or is using the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f) to count unrecovered indirect costs toward any required cost sharing or matching under awards. The basis for this policy is that recipients' indirect costs that are allowable and allocable to DoD projects and programs are legitimate costs of carrying out those projects and programs.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)To implement the policy in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section C of FMS Article VI unless a statute requires otherwise.

####### § 1128.625 Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(3) specifies that, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, recipients may use program income to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of their awards.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using either:

(i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1128.720; or

(ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of § 1128.720, that includes use of at least some program income as cost sharing or matching.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.

####### § 1128.630 Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:

(1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and

(2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:

######## Cost principles to be used for valuation.

(1)(i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.

######## i.e.,

(ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property (counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.

######## Donations of property to projects or programs under awards.

(2)(i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:

(A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and

(B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).

(ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.

(iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(c)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the wording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, or other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.635 Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(e) through (j) and 2 CFR 200.434(b) through (g) specifies how to value and document various types of third-party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)To implement the OMB guidance described in paragraph (a) of this section as it applies to valuation and documentation of third-party in-kind contributions, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording Section VI of appendix F to this part provides as Section F of FMS Article VI.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve any paragraph of the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section F of FMS Article VI if the DoD Component determines that there will be no possibility of third-party in-kind contributions under awards using those terms and conditions.

###### Subpart G-Program Income (FMS Article VII)

####### § 1128.700 Purpose of FMS Article VII.

FMS Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for program income that recipients earn. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.80 and 200.307.

####### § 1128.705 Content of FMS Article VII.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the kinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the recipient's accountability for it, and related matters.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VII the wording appendix G to this part provides, unless, as authorized by §§ 1128.710 through 1128.725, there are revisions to the wording of Sections A and E of the article or Section D is reserved.

####### § 1128.710 What program income includes.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)Under the definition of "program income" at 2 CFR 200.80 and related OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements may include as program income:

(1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and

(2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(c)- (1)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.

######## Exceptions.

(2)If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:

(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

(ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

####### § 1128.715 Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.

######## Policy.

(a)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that recipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and royalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.

######## Exception.

(2)If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for establishing recipient obligations for the license fees and royalties described in paragraph (a) of this section, it may reserve Section D of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1128.720 Program income use.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.

(1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:

######## Addition.

(i)A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.

######## Deduction.

(ii)A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.

######## Cost sharing or matching.

(iii)Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.

######## Combination.

(iv)The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.

(2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.

######## Award terms and conditions.,Default-addition alternative.

(c)(1)In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:

(i) Research awards; and

(ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.

######## Deduction alternative.

(2)A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:

(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: "1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award."

(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: "If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts."

######## Cost-sharing or matching alternative.

(3)A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: "You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award."

######## A combination of alternatives.

(4)A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

####### § 1128.725 Program income after the period of performance.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency regulations, grant or cooperative agreement terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that a recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of FMS Article VII the wording for that section that is provided in appendix G to this part. That wording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

###### § 1128.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning financial and program management, including recipients' financial management systems, payments, cost sharing or matching, program income, budget and program revisions, audits, allowable costs, and periods of availability of funds.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:

(1) Sections 200.80, 200.209, and 200.302 through 200.309;

(2) Sections 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting; and

(3) Subparts E and F.

###### § 1128.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1128.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1128.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

###### Appendix A to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article I, "Financial Management System Standards"

Unless any part of this appendix is reserved, as provided in § 1128.105, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article I.

####### Section A. System standard for States.

As a State, you must expend and account for funds under this award in accordance with:

1. Applicable State laws; and

2. To the extent they comply with the requirements of Section B of this Article, your procedures for expending and accounting for your own State funds.

####### Section B. System standards for all recipients.

Your financial management system must provide for:

1. Inclusion, in your accounts, of the following information about each DoD grant or cooperative agreement that you receive:

a. That you received the award from DoD;

b. The number and title listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance for the DoD program under which the award was made;

c. The DoD award number; and

d. The year (your fiscal year) in which you received the award.

2. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of the award needed to comply with financial and programmatic reporting requirements that are specified in REP Articles I and II of these general terms and conditions, as supplemented by any award-specific terms and conditions of this award concerning reporting requirements. If you are asked at any time under this award to report financial information on an accrual basis, you:

a. Need not establish an accrual accounting system if you maintain your records on a different basis; and

b. May develop the accrual data based on an analysis of the data you have on hand.

3. Records that identify adequately the sources of funds for all activities funded by DoD awards, including any required cost sharing or matching, and the application of those funds. This includes funding authorizations; your obligations and expenditures of the funds; unobligated balances; property and other assets under the award; program income; and interest.

4. Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets under this award. You must adequately safeguard all assets and ensure they are used solely for authorized purposes (see Section C of this article for additional requirements concerning internal controls).

5. Comparison of expenditures under this award for project or program purposes with amounts in the approved budget for those purposes.

6. The ability to relate financial data to performance accomplishments under this award if you are required to do so by the programmatic reporting requirements in REP Article I of these general terms and conditions, as supplemented by any award-specific terms and conditions of this award concerning reporting requirements.

7. Written procedures:

a. To implement requirements specified in FMS Article II, "Payments;"

b. For determining the allowability of costs, which for this award are determined in accordance with FMS Article III, "Allowable costs, period of availability of funds, and fee or profit," of these general terms and conditions, as supplemented by any award-specific terms and conditions of this award that relate to allowability of costs.

####### Section C. Internal controls.,e.g.,

Your system of internal controls must conform to OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.303. With respect to paragraph (e) of 2 CFR 200.303, your internal control system must include measures to safeguard any information that Federal statute, Executive order, or regulation requires to be protected (personally identifiable or export controlled information), whether generated under the award or provided to you and identified as being subject to protection.

###### Appendix B to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article II, "Payments"

Unless a DoD Component adds, deletes, or modifies wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article II.

####### Section A. Awards to States.

If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award do not identify it as an award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 (Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the Cash Management Improvement Act), then this award is subject to Subpart B of that part. Consistent with Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205:

####### Payment method, timing, and amounts. You must:

1.

a. Minimize the time between your receipt of a payment under this award and your disbursement of those funds for program purposes.

b. Limit the amount of each advance payment request to the minimum amount you need to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the program or project.

c. Submit each advance payment request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for program purposes, so that your receipt of the funds will be as close in time as is administratively feasible to your actual cash outlay for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

####### Interest.

2.Unlike awards subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, neither you nor we will incur any interest liability due to a difference in timing between your receipt of payments under this award and your disbursement of those funds for project or program purposes.

####### Payment method.

1.Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you are authorized to request advance payments under this award. That authorization is contingent on your continuing to maintain, or demonstrating the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between your receipt of each payment and your disbursement of the funds for program purposes. Note that you are not required to request advance payments and may instead, at your option, request reimbursements of funds after you disburse them for project or program purposes.

####### Amounts requested.

2.You must:

a. Limit the amount of any advance payment request to the minimum amount needed to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project, including direct project costs and a proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

b. Exclude from any payment request amounts you are withholding from payments to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of the work. You may request those amounts when you make the payments to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of the work.

c. Exclude from any payment request amounts from any of the following sources that are available to you for program purposes under this award: program income, including repayments to a revolving fund; rebates; refunds; contract settlements; audit recoveries; and interest earned on any of those funds. You must disburse those funds for program purposes before requesting additional funds from us.

####### Timing of requests.

3.For any advance payment you request, you should submit the request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for project or program purposes. With time for agency processing of the request, that should result in payment as close as is administratively feasible to your actual disbursements for project or program purposes.

####### Frequency of requests.

4.You may request payments as often as you wish unless you have been granted a waiver from requirements to receive payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT). If you have been granted a waiver from EFT requirements, the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify the frequency with which you may submit payment requests.

####### Withholding of payments.

5.We will withhold payments for allowable costs under the award at any time during the period of performance only if one or more of the following applies:

a. We suspend either payments or the award, or disallow otherwise allowable costs, as a remedy under OAR Article III due to your material failure to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of this award. If we suspend payments and not the award, we will release withheld payments upon your subsequent compliance. If we suspend the award, then amounts of payments are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of OAR Article III.

b. You are delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, "Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables," in which case we may, after reasonable notice, inform you that we will not make any further payments for costs you incurred after a specified date until you correct the conditions or liquidate the indebtedness to the Federal Government.

c. The award-specific terms and conditions of this award include additional requirements that provide for withholding of payments based on conditions identified during our pre-award risk evaluation, in which case you should have been notified about the nature of those conditions and the actions needed to remove the additional requirements.

####### Depository requirements.

ii. You would not expect the best reasonably available interest-bearing account to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on your cash balances of advance payments under Federal grants and cooperative agreements.

iii. The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would require you to maintain an average or minimum balance higher than it would be feasible for you to do within your expected Federal and non-Federal cash balances.

iv. A foreign government or banking system precludes your use of interest-bearing accounts.

d. You may retain for administrative expenses up to $500 per year of interest that you earn in the aggregate on advance payments you receive under this award and other Federal grants and cooperative agreements.

###### Appendix C to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article III, "Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit"

Unless a DoD Component reserves sections or paragraphs of this article, as permitted by §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article III.

####### Section A. Allowable costs.

This section, with the clarification provided in Section B, specifies which Federal cost principles must be used in determining the allowability of costs charged to this award, a subrecipient's costs charged to any cost-type subaward that you make under this award, and a contractor's costs charged to any cost-type procurement transaction into which you enter under this award. These cost principles also govern the allowable costs that you or a subrecipient of a subaward at any tier below this award may consider when establishing the amount of any fixed-amount subaward or fixed-price procurement transaction at the next lower tier. The set of cost principles to be used in each case depends on the type of entity incurring the cost under the award, subaward, or contract.

####### General case.

1.If you, your subrecipient, or your contractor is:

####### An institution of higher education

a., the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendix III to that part.

####### A hospital

b., the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200, which currently specifies the cost principles in appendix IX to 45 CFR part 75 as the applicable cost principles.

####### A nonprofit organization other than a hospital or institution of higher education

c., the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices IV and VIII to that part. In accordance with guidance in 2 CFR 200.401(c), a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200 is subject to the cost principles for for-profit entities specified in paragraph 1.e of this section.

####### A State, local government, or Indian tribe

d., the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices V through VII to that part.

####### A for-profit entity (other than a hospital) or a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200:

e.

i. The allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with:

(A) The cost principles for commercial organizations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at Subpart 31.2 of 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) at Subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231; and

(B) For a for-profit entity, the additional provisions on allowability of audit costs, in 32 CFR 34.16(f).

ii. The indirect cost rate to use in that determination is:

(A) The for-profit entity's federally negotiated indirect cost rate if it has one.

(B) Subject to negotiation between you and the for-profit entity if it does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. The rate that you negotiate may provide for reimbursement only of costs that are allowable in accordance with the cost principles specified in paragraph A.1.e.i of this article.

####### Exception.

2.You may use your own cost principles in determining the allowability of a contractor's costs charged to a cost-type procurement transaction under this award-or in pricing for a fixed-price contract based on estimated costs-as long as your cost principles comply with the Federal cost principles that paragraph A.1 of this section identifies as applicable to the contractor.

####### Section B. Clarifications concerning charges for professional journal publications.

For an entity that Section A of this article makes subject to the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200:

1. Costs of publishing in professional journals are allowable under 2 CFR 200.461(b) only if they are consistently applied across the organization. An organization may not charge costs of journal publications as direct costs to this award if it charges any of the same type of costs for other journal publications as indirect costs.

2. "Costs of publication or sharing of research results" in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) are the "charges for professional journal publications" described in 2 CFR 200.461(b) and subject to the conditions of 2 CFR 200.461(b)(1) and (2).

####### Section C. Period of availability of funds.

You may charge to this award only:

1. Allowable costs incurred during the period of performance specified in this award, including any subsequent amendments to it;

2. Any pre-award costs that you are authorized (by either the terms and conditions of FMS Article IV or the DoD awarding official) to incur prior to the start of the period of performance, at your own risk, for purposes of the project or program under this award; and

3. Costs of publishing in professional journals incurred after the period of performance, as permitted under 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3), if:

a. We receive the request for payment for such costs no later than the date on which REP Article II requires you to submit the final financial report to us (or, if we grant your request for an extension of the due date, that later date on which the report is due); and

b. Your reported expenditures on the final financial report include the amount you disbursed for those costs.

1. You may not receive any fee or profit under this award.

2. You may not use funds available to you under this award to pay fee or profit to an entity of any type to which you make a subaward.

3. You may pay fee or profit to an entity with which you enter into a procurement transaction to purchase goods or general support services for your use in carrying out the project or program under the award.

###### Appendix D to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article IV, "Revision of Budget and Program Plans"

Unless a DoD Component reserves a section or paragraph or adds or modifies wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.410 through 1128.430, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article IV.

####### Section A. Approved budget.

1. Is the most recent version of the budget that you submitted, and we approved (either at the time of the initial award or a more recent amendment), to summarize planned expenditures for project or program purposes.

2. Includes all Federal funding that we make available to you under this award to use for project or program purposes and any cost sharing or matching that you are required to provide under this award for those same purposes.

####### Non-construction activities.

1.You must request prior approval from us for any of the following program or budget revisions in non-construction activities:

a. A change in the scope or objective of the project or program under this award, even if there is no associated budget revision that requires our prior approval.

b. A change in a key person identified in the award cover pages.

c. The approved principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in his or her time devoted to the project.

d. The inclusion of direct costs that require prior approval in accordance with the applicable cost principles, as identified in FMS Article III.

e. The transfer to other categories of expense of funds included in the approved budget for participant support costs, as defined at 2 CFR 200.75.

f. A subaward to another entity under which it will perform a portion of the substantive project or program under the award, if it was not included in the approved budget. This does not apply to your contracts for acquisition of supplies, equipment, or general support services you need to carry out the project or program.

g. Any change in the cost sharing or matching you provide under the award, as included in the approved budget, for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval.

h. A transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions, and activities, if the Federal share of the total value for your award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and the cumulative amount of the transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the approved budget.

i. The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program.

####### Construction activities.

You are authorized, without requesting prior approval from us, to:

1. Charge to this award after you receive it pre-award costs that you incurred, at your own risk, up to 90 calendar days before the start date of the period of performance, as long as they are costs that would be allowable charges to the project or program under the terms and conditions of FMS Article III if they were incurred during the period of performance.

2. Carry forward an unobligated balance to a subsequent period of performance under this award.

3. Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months, as long as:

a. You notify us in writing with the supporting reasons and revised end date of the period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the current end date.

b. The extension does not require any additional Federal funding.

c. The extension does not involve any change in the scope or objectives of the project or program.

1. We will review each request you submit for prior approval for a budget or program change and, within 30 calendar days of our receipt of your request, we will respond to you in writing to either:

a. Notify you whether your request is approved; or

b. Inform you that we still are considering the request, in which case we will let you know when you may expect our decision.

2. [Reserved]

###### Appendix E to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article V, "Non-Federal Audits"

Unless a DoD Component reserves Section B, as permitted by § 1128.605, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for FMS Article V.

####### Section A. Requirements for entities subject to the Single Audit Act.

You and each subrecipient under this award that is an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe must comply with the audit requirements specified in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, which is the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. chapter 75).

####### Section B. Requirements for for-profit entities.,e.g.,

Any for-profit entity that receives a subaward from you under this award is subject to the audit requirements specified in 32 CFR 34.16. Your subaward terms and conditions will require the subrecipient to provide the reports to you if it is willing to do so, so that you can resolve audit findings that pertain specifically to your subaward (disallowance of costs). If the for-profit entity is unwilling to agree to provide the auditor's report to you, contact the grants officer for this award to discuss an alternative approach for carrying out audit oversight of the subaward. If the grants officer does not provide an alternative approach within 30 days of receiving your request, you may determine an approach to ensure the for-profit subrecipient's compliance with the subaward terms and conditions, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.501(h).

###### Appendix F to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article VI, "Cost Sharing or Matching"

Unless a DoD Component reserves FMS Article VI in its entirety, reserves one or more paragraphs within sections of the article, or includes added or alternate wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for FMS Article VI.

####### Section A. Required cost sharing or matching

.

1. If any cost sharing or matching is required under this award, the total amount or percentage required is shown in the award cover pages and included in the approved budget. That cost sharing or matching includes all:

a. Cash contributions to the project or program either made by or through (if made by a third party) you and any subrecipients.

b. Third-party in-kind contributions to the project or program.

2. You must obtain our prior approval if you wish to:

a. Change the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under this award.

b. [Reserved]

####### Section B. Allowability as cost sharing or matching.

Each cash or third party in-kind contribution toward any cost sharing or matching required under this award, whether put forward by you or a subrecipient under a subaward that you make, is allowable as cost sharing or matching if:

1. You (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) maintain records from which one may verify that the contribution was made to the project or program and, if it is a third-party in-kind contribution, its value.

2. The contribution is not counted as cost sharing or matching for any other Federal award.

3. The contribution is:

a. Allowable under the cost principles applicable to you (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) under FMS Article III of these terms and conditions; and

b. Allocable to the project or program and reasonable.

4. The Government does not pay for the contribution through another Federal award, unless that award is under a program that has a Federal statute authorizing application of that program's Federal funds to other Federal programs' cost sharing or matching requirements.

5. The value of the contribution is not reimbursed by the Federal share of this award as either a direct or indirect cost.

6. The contribution conforms to the other terms and conditions of this award, including the award-specific terms and conditions.

####### Section C. Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.

You may use your own or a subrecipient's unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching under this award. Unrecovered indirect costs means the difference between the amount of indirect costs charged to the award and the amount that you and any subrecipients could have charged in accordance with your respective approved indirect cost rates, whether those rates are negotiated or de minimis (as described in 2 CFR 200.414(f)).

####### Section D. Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.

If FMS Article VII of these general terms and conditions or the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify that you are to use some or all of the program income you earn to meet cost-sharing or matching requirements under the award, then program income is allowable as cost sharing or matching to the extent specified in those award terms and conditions.

####### Section E. Valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.

You must establish values for services or property contributed or donated toward cost sharing or matching by you or subrecipients in accordance with the provisions of this section. These contributions or donations are distinct from third-party in-kind contributions to you or subrecipients, which are addressed in Section F of this article.

####### Usual valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.,i.e.,

1.Values established for contributions of services or property by you or a subrecipient must be the amounts allowable in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution (you or the subrecipient), as identified in FMS Article III. For property, that generally is depreciation.

####### Needed approvals for, and valuation of, property that you or subrecipients donate.

2.

####### Types of property that may be donated.

a.

####### Buildings or land.

i.If the purposes of this award include construction, facilities acquisition, or long-term use of real property, you may donate buildings or land to the project if you obtain our prior approval. Donation of property to the project, as described in PROP Article I, means counting the value of the property toward cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.

####### Other capital assets.

ii.If you obtain our prior approval, you may donate to the project other capital assets identified in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3).

####### Usual valuation of donated property.

b.Unless you obtain our approval as described in paragraph E.2.c of this article, the value for the donated property must be the lesser of:

i. The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation, or

ii. The current fair market value.

####### Approval needed for alternative valuation of property.

c.If you obtained our approval in the approved budget, you may count as cost sharing or matching the current fair market value of the donated property even if it exceeds the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation.

####### Federal interest in donated property.

d.Donating buildings, land, or other property to the project, rather than charging depreciation, results in a Federal interest in the property in accordance with PROP Article I of these terms and conditions.

####### General.,i.e.,

1.If a third party furnishes goods or services to you or subrecipients that are to be counted toward cost sharing or matching under this award, the entity to which the third party furnishes the goods or services (you or a subrecipient) must document the fair market value of those in-kind contributions and, to the extent feasible, support those values using the same methods the entity uses internally.

####### Valuation of third-party services.

2.You must establish values for third-party volunteer services and services of third parties' employees furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:

####### Volunteer services.

a.Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor must be valued in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(e).

####### Services of third parties' employees.

b.When a third-party organization furnishes the services of its employees to you or a subrecipient, values for the contributions must be established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(f).

####### Additional requirement for donations to nonprofit organizations.

c.For volunteer services or services of third parties' employees furnished to a nonprofit organization:

i. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.434(e) also applies and may require the nonprofit organization to allocate a proportionate share of its applicable indirect costs to the donated services.

ii. The indirect costs that the nonprofit organization allocates to the donated services in that case must be considered project costs and may be either reimbursed under the award or counted toward required cost sharing or matching, but not both.

####### Valuation of third-party property.

3.You must establish values for third-party property furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:

####### Supplies donated by third parties.,e.g.,

a.When a third-party organization donates supplies (office, laboratory, workshop, or classroom supplies), the value that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair market value of the supplies at the time of donation.

####### Equipment, buildings, or land donated by third parties.

b.

i. The value of third-party donations of equipment, buildings, or land that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching when the third party transferred title to you or a subrecipient depends on the purpose of the award in accordance with the following:

(A) If one of the purposes of the award is to assist you or the subrecipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings, or land, you may count the aggregate fair market value of the donated property toward cost sharing or matching.

(B) If the award's purposes instead include only the support of activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, you may only charge depreciation unless you obtain our prior approval to count as cost sharing or matching the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land.

ii. The values of the donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the entity to which the third party transferred title to the property, with the qualifications specified in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(1) and (2) for donated land and buildings and donated equipment, respectively.

####### Use of space donated by third parties.

c.If a third party makes space available for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal, as described in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(3).

####### Equipment loaned by third parties.

d.If a third party loans equipment for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed its fair rental value.

###### Appendix G to Part 1128 - Terms and Conditions for FMS Article VII, "Program Income"

##### PART 1130 - PROPERTY ADMINISTRATION: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Title to Property (PROP Article I)

####### § 1130.100 Purpose of PROP Article I.

PROP Article I specifies in whom and under what conditions title to property vests under the award. It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements:

(a) Pertaining to vesting of title to property, in 2 CFR 200.311(a), 200.312(a), 200.313(a), 200.314(a), and 200.315(a).

(b) Pertaining to the property trust relationship in 2 CFR 200.316.

####### § 1130.105 Title to property acquired under awards.

######## General policy.

(a)Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other than by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in PROP Articles II-IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.

######## Exceptions to the general policy when there is statutory authority,Exempt property in general.

(b)-(1)If a DoD Component has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either unconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II-IV and VI. This subpart refers to acquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority-and elects to use it-as "exempt property."

######## Research awards.,i.e.,

(2)(i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property (equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research-without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate-if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.

(ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:

(A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.

(B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.

(C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(c)-(1)Unless a DoD Component has a statute authorizing it to identify acquired property as exempt property, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, it must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article I.

######## Exceptions.

(2)(i) If a DoD Component has statutory authority such as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and elects to use that authority for awards subject to its general terms and conditions, it must insert wording in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I to:

(A) Identify the type or types of property it is exempting from the standard requirements for title vesting, use, and disposition contained in PROP Articles II through IV and VI and reporting requirements contained in REP Article III of the general terms and conditions.

(B) If it is exempting the property from some, but not all, of the standard requirements, identify the requirements to which the exempt property will be subject.

(ii) Paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I in general terms and conditions used for research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research generally should provide for vesting of title to acquired equipment and supplies in those types of entities when they are conducting basic or applied research subject only to the three conditions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

####### § 1130.110 Property trust relationship.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:

(1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was acquired or improved; and

(2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's use and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title to real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:

(1) Must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except that a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

(2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the wording of Section B of PROP Article I to require recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

####### § 1130.115 Title to federally owned property.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government and include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I to indicate that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government; or

(2) Reserve Section C if it provides no federally owned property under its awards.

####### § 1130.120 Federal interest in donated property.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Federal Government acquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the recipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in donated real property or equipment; or

(2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market value of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.

####### § 1130.125 Federal interest in property improved under awards.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the Federal interest in improvements to real property or equipment that results if a recipient directly charges the costs of the improvements to an award.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in improved real property or equipment; or

(2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

###### Subpart B - Property Management System (PROP Article II)

####### § 1130.200 Purpose of PROP Article II.

(a) PROP Article II prescribes standards for:

(1) Insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards;

(2) The system that a recipient uses to manage both equipment that is acquired or improved in whole or in part under awards and federally owned property.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 and 200.313(d)(1) through (4), and partially implements 2 CFR 200.313(b).

####### § 1130.205 Insurance coverage for real property and equipment.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 includes a requirement for recipients' insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under grants and cooperative agreements and states that federally owned property need not be insured unless required by Federal award terms and conditions.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to provide insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards. However, unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards will not require recipients to insure federally owned property.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article II; or

(2) Reserve Section A of PROP Article II if there will be no real property or equipment acquired or improved under awards using those terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.

####### § 1130.305 Use of real property.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) states that, except as otherwise provided by Federal statute or the Federal awarding agency, a recipient must use real property acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the recipient must not dispose of the property or encumber its title or other interests.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards must permit recipients to do the following:

(1) While real property acquired or improved under an award still is needed for the authorized purpose, also use it for other projects or programs that either are supported by DoD Components or other Federal agencies or not federally supported, as long as that use does not interfere with the property's use for the authorized purpose.

(2) After the real property no longer is needed for the authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award administration office, use the property on other federally supported projects or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property was acquired or improved.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:

(1) Include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article III; or

(2) If a statute or program regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies different requirements for recipients' use of real property, substitute alternative wording for Section A to specify those requirements.

####### § 1130.310 Disposition of real property.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(c):

(1) Addresses the recipient's responsibility to request disposition instructions for real property when the recipient no longer needs it for the originally authorized purpose; and

###### Appendix A to Part 1130 - Terms and Conditions for PROP Article I, "Title to Property"

Unless a DoD Component inserts or adds wording or reserves sections of the article, as provided in §§ 1130.105 through 1130.125, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article I.

####### General.

1.Other than any property identified in paragraph A.2 of this section as exempt property:

a. Title to real property, equipment, and supplies that you acquire (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise) and charge as direct project costs under this award vests in you, the recipient. Title to intangible property that you acquire (other than by developing or producing it) under this award also vests in you.

b. That title is a conditional title, subject to the terms and conditions in PROP Articles II-IV, Section D of PROP Article VI, and REP Article III of this award.

c. There is a Federal interest in the property, other than intangible property that you develop or produce under the award. For real property, equipment, and intangible property, we retain this Federal interest until final disposition of the property under PROP Article III (for real property), PROP Article IV (for equipment and supplies), or Section D of PROP Article VI (for intangible property that is acquired, other than by developing or producing it), a period that in some cases may extend beyond closeout of this award.

####### Exempt property.

2.[Reserved]

####### Basic requirement.

1.Other than intangible property that you develop or produce under the award, you hold any real property, equipment, or intangible property that you acquire or improve under this award in trust for the beneficiaries of the project or program that you are carrying out under the award.

####### Notices of record.

2.[Reserved]

####### Section C. Federally owned property.

Title to any federally owned property that we provide to you under this award (or for which accountability is transferred to this award from another Federal award) remains with the Federal Government.

####### Section D. Federal interest in donated real property or equipment.,i.e.,

If real property or equipment is acquired under this award through your donation of the property to the project or program (counting the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records or the fair market value as permitted under FMS Article VI of this award as part of your share of project costs to meet any cost sharing or matching requirements, rather than charging depreciation):

1. The Federal Government acquires through that donation an interest in the real property or equipment, the value of which at any given time is the product of:

a. The Federal share of the project costs under this award; and

b. The current fair market value of the property at that time.

2. The real property or equipment is subject to Section B of this article and the terms and conditions of PROP Articles II-IV and REP Article III that are applicable to property acquired under the award.

3. The Federal interest in the real property or equipment must be addressed at the time of property disposition.

1. The Federal Government has an interest in improvements (as distinct from ordinary repairs and maintenance) you make to an item of real property or equipment if you charge the costs of the improvements as direct costs to this award.

2. We thereby acquire an interest in the property if the Government did not previously have one. If the Government already had an interest in the property, the value of that Federal interest in the property increases by the amount of the Federal interest in the improvements.

3. The property is subject to Section B of this article and the terms and conditions of PROP Articles II-IV and REP Article III that are applicable to real property or equipment acquired under the award.

4. The Federal interest must be addressed at the time of property disposition.

Unless a DoD Component substitutes wording in Section A, as provided in § 1130.305, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article III.

1. You must use real property acquired or improved under this award for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. During that time, you may not:

a. Dispose of the property except, with the approval of the award administration office, to acquire replacement property under this award, in which case you must use the proceeds from the disposition as an offset to the cost of the replacement property; or

b. Encumber the title or other interests in the property without the approval of the award administration office identified in this award.

2. During the time that the real property is used for the originally authorized purpose, you may make the property available for use on other projects or programs, but only if that use will not interfere with the property's use as needed for its originally authorized purpose.

a. First preference must be given to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components and second preference to those supported by other Federal agencies.

b. Third preference is for other projects or programs not currently supported by the Federal Government. You should charge user fees for use of the property in those cases, if it is at all practicable.

3. When the real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award administration office, you may delay final disposition of the property to use it on other federally sponsored projects or programs. A condition for the award administration office's approval is that the other projects or programs have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property was acquired or improved.

####### Section B. Disposition of real property.

When you no longer need real property for the originally authorized purpose, you must obtain disposition instructions from the award administration office, except as provided in paragraph A.3 of this article. Those instructions will provide for one of the following three alternatives, which are that you:

1. Retain title after compensating us for the Federal interest in the property, which is to be computed as specified in the definition of "Federal interest."

2. Sell the property and compensate us for the Federal interest in the property, as described in 2 CFR 200.311(c)(2).

####### Section A. Property subject to this article.

This article specifies requirements for use and disposition of equipment and supplies. If a provision of PROP Article I identifies any type of equipment or supplies as exempt property, requirements of this Article apply to that exempt property only to the extent specified in that provision of PROP Article I or an award-specific term or condition. The types of non-exempt property to which this article applies are:

1. Supplies that you acquire either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching under this award; and

2. Equipment for which title is vested conditionally in you. That includes equipment with a conditional title resulting from your having, either under this award or under a previous award from which you transferred accountability for the equipment to this award:

a. Directly charged as project costs, in whole or in part, the acquisition (by purchase, construction or fabrication, or development) of equipment;

b. Donated the equipment to the project or program by counting the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records or the fair market value toward any cost sharing or matching requirements under the award, rather than charging depreciation (see PROP Article I, Section D); or

c. Directly charged as project costs improvements to the equipment that meet the criteria given in paragraph E.1 of PROP Article I.

####### Section B. Requirements for a State's use and disposition of equipment.

You:

1. Must use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.

2. May not encumber the property without the prior written approval of the award administration office.

3. Must use and dispose of the equipment in accordance with your State laws and procedures.

####### Section C. Use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

You:

1. Must use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program under this award until the equipment is no longer needed for those purposes, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by this award.

2. May not encumber the equipment without the prior written approval of the award administration office.

3. During the time that the equipment is used for the project or program under this award:

a. You must make the equipment available for use on other projects or programs but only if that use will not interfere with the equipment's use as needed for the project or program supported by this award.

i. First preference must be given to other projects or programs supported or previously supported by DoD Components

ii. Second preference to projects or programs supported or previously supported by other Federal agencies.

iii. Third preference is for other projects or programs not supported by the Federal Government. You should charge user fees for use of the equipment in those cases, if it is at all practicable.

b. You may use the equipment, if you need to acquire replacement equipment, as a trade-in or sell it (using sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return) and use the proceeds from the sale to offset the cost of the replacement equipment.

4. When the equipment is no longer needed for the project or program under this award, you may defer final disposition of the equipment and continue to use it on other federally sponsored projects or programs. You must give first priority to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components.

5. Notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income, you may not use equipment in which there currently is a Federal interest-whether you acquired it under this award or are otherwise accountable for it under this award-to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services.

####### Section D. Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

You must request disposition instructions from the award administration office when either original or replacement equipment acquired under this award with a current fair market value that exceeds $5,000 is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other federally sponsored activities as described in paragraph C.4 of this article. For each item of equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or less, you may retain, sell, or otherwise dispose of the item with no further obligation to the Federal Government.

1. We may issue disposition instructions that:

a. Allow you to retain or sell any item of equipment after compensating us for the Federal interest in the property, which is to be computed as specified in the definition of "Federal interest;" or

b. Require you to transfer title to the equipment to a Federal agency or a third party, in which case you are entitled to compensation from us for the non-Federal interest in the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

2. If we fail to provide disposition instructions for any item of equipment within 120 calendar days of receiving your request, you may retain or sell the equipment, but you must compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the equipment.

3. If you sell the equipment:

a. You must use sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return; and

b. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.

####### Use.

1.As long as we retain a Federal interest in supplies acquired under this award either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching, you may not use the supplies to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income.

####### Disposition.

2.If you have a residual inventory of unused supplies with aggregate value exceeding $5,000 at the end of the period of performance under this award, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, you must retain the supplies or sell them but must in either case compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the supplies. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.

##### PART 1134 - FINANCIAL, PROGRAMMATIC, AND PROPERTY REPORTING: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Performance Management, Monitoring, and Reporting (REP Article I)

####### § 1134.100 Purpose of REP Article I.

REP Article I of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to recipient reporting on program performance. It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.328; and

(b) Portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that relate to performance reporting.

####### § 1134.105 Performance reporting for construction awards.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(c) notes that agencies rely heavily on onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under construction grants and cooperative agreements and states that agencies may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)DoD Components may require performance reports under construction awards only when necessary and, to reduce recipient burdens, should coordinate the performance reporting with financial reporting to the maximum extent practicable.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)(1) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and does not need performance reports for those awards, it:

(i) Should reserve Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions;

(ii) Must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 and 1134.145 to include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Sections E and G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, in order to require recipients to promptly report significant developments and reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits.

(iii) Must follow the specifications in § 1134.140 to insert wording in Section F of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, to tell recipients where and how to submit any reports of significant developments.

(2) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and determines that it needs performance reports for those awards:

(i) It may tailor the template and content that appendix A to this part provides for Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as needed to specify the reporting requirements or, as appropriate, instead integrate those requirements into REP Article II on financial reporting. The form, format, or data elements that the DoD Component specifies for any of those performance reports must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320, to use OMB-approved information collections if more than 9 recipients will be subject to the reporting requirement.

(ii) It must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 through 1134.145 concerning Sections E through G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.

####### § 1134.110 Performance reporting for non-construction awards.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report that it does not need.

######## DoD implementation,Interim reports.

(b)-(1)DoD Components should waive requirements for interim performance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers have an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program oversight during the period of performance.

######## Final reports,Research.

(2)-(i)DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under research awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary purpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve as a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, and conclusions or recommendations of the research.

######## Non-construction awards other than research.

(ii)DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final performance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving requirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms and conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. A DoD Component must either use the wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, in accordance with §§ 1134.115 through 1134.145, to:

(1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance reporting (see § 1134.115);

(2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see § 1134.120);

(3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see § 1134.125);

(4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see § 1134.130);

(5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see § 1134.135);

(6) Specify reporting procedures (see § 1134.140); and

(7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see § 1134.145).

####### § 1134.115 Content and forms, formats, or data elements for interim and final performance reporting under non-construction awards.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328(b)(2) state that Federal awarding agencies must require recipients to use standard OMB-approved information collections for reporting performance information.

(2) 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) list types of information that performance reports under non-construction grants and cooperative agreements will contain, as appropriate, unless other collections are approved by OMB.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)(1) The content of the information collections that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for non-construction awards must include the elements listed in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) that are appropriate to the projects or programs subject to those general terms and conditions.

(2) Forms, formats, and data elements that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for performance reporting under non-construction awards must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 to use OMB-approved information collections, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

######## e.g.,

(3) To the maximum extent practicable, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that recipients use Governmentwide standard forms, formats, and data elements that also are used by other Federal agencies for similar programs, recipients, and types of awards (the Research Performance Progress Report format or any successor to it that OMB clears for interim performance progress reports under research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations).

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section A of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify the form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for interim and final performance reports. Section A of REP Article I may specify a different requirement for final performance reports than interim reports.

####### § 1134.120 Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) addresses performance reporting frequency under grants and cooperative agreements and due dates.

######## Reporting frequency.,e.g.,

(1)The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent than annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (when more frequent reporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).

######## Due dates.

(2)The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:

(i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; and

(ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the agency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and due dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and added specifications concerning reporting periods:

######## Reporting frequency.

(1)DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.

######## Reporting periods.,i.e.,

(2)For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim performance reports on a cumulative basis-the second and any subsequent performance report should address only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier interim performance reports.

######## Due dates.

(3)If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual circumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component must specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim reports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:

(1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;

(2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and

(3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the reporting period.

####### § 1134.125 Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due date if a recipient submits a justified request.

######## DoD implementation,Due dates.

(b)-(1)Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):

######## General.

(i)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:

(A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.

(B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.

######## Exception.

(ii)A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.

######## Reporting periods,Non-construction awards other than research.

(2)-(i)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.

######## Research.,i.e.,

(ii)Final reports for research awards must be cumulative (each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:

(1) Must either:

######## i.e.,

(i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is either 90 or 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance, as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(i), by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only the number of days (90 or 120 calendar days) appropriate for the type of awards; or

(ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the 90 calendar day due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for non-construction awards other than research, by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only "120 calendar days" in lieu of "90 calendar days."

######## e.g.,

(2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for final reports (that research awards require cumulative final reports).

####### § 1134.130 Requesting extensions of due dates for performance reports.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that, if a recipient submits a justified request for an extension in the due date for any interim or final performance report under a grant or cooperative agreement, an agency may extend the due date.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that a recipient may request an extension of the due date for interim or final performance reports. DoD Components should grant requests that provide adequate justification. For a DoD Component that pre-approves a 30-day extension of due dates for final performance reports in its general terms and conditions, as described in § 1134.125(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii), any award-specific extensions would be beyond the pre-approved 30-day extension.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section D of REP Article I on extensions of performance reporting due dates.

####### § 1134.135 Reporting significant developments.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(d) states that a recipient must promptly notify the awarding agency about significant developments under grants and cooperative agreements.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to report significant developments, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(d).

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section E of REP Article I on reporting of significant developments.

####### § 1134.140 Performance reporting procedures.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients about performance reporting procedures.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions must insert wording in Section F of REP Article I (which is reserved in the template for REP Article I that appendix A to this part provides), to specify:

(1) The office or offices to which a recipient must submit its interim and final performance reports, any requests in due dates for those reports, and any reports of significant developments; and

######## e.g.,

(2) How the recipient is to submit those reports and requests (email or other electronic submission method).

######## i.e.

(3) For research awards, component must assure that the recipient final report complies with the distribution and marking requirements of DoD Manual 3200.14, Volume 1. This includes the requirement that all significant scientific or technological findings, recommendations, and results derived from DoD endeavors-which shall include the final performance report at a minimum-are recorded and provided to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Follow guidance in (b)(1) to inform recipients as the submission and distribution requirements (Component may choose to receive the report and submit to DTIC themselves or provide instructions to recipient on submission to DTIC).

(4) Access to Research Results

(i) For purposes of this term and condition, the following definition applies:

######## Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript:

The final version of a peer-reviewed article for a professional journal publication disclosing the results of scientific research which is authored or co-authored by the recipient or funded, in whole or in part, with funds from a DoD award, that includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article.

######## www.dtic.mil.

(ii) The recipient shall ensure that any Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) repository, currently atEnsure that the Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted when it is accepted for publication, and when the final title and date of publication are known.

####### § 1134.145 Site visits.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(e) states that a Federal awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must state that the Federal Government reserves the right to make site visits as warranted.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section G of REP Article I concerning site visits.

###### Subpart B - Financial Reporting (REP Article II)

####### § 1134.200 Purpose of REP Article II.

REP Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to financial reporting. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 and the portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that are specific to financial reporting under grants and cooperative agreements.

####### § 1134.205 Reporting forms, formats, or data elements.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 states that Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to use only the standard OMB-approved Governmentwide data elements for collection of financial information, unless OMB approves other forms, formats, or data elements for financial information collection.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)DoD Components must collect financial information from recipients using OMB-approved forms, formats, or data elements.

(1) Unless current approvals expire, approved financial information collections include the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) and Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270). In the future, they would include any additional information collections that OMB approves.

(2) For all but the recipient's final financial report, a DoD Component may rely on financial information the recipient provides on the SF-270 or other OMB-approved payment request form, format, or data elements if that financial information is sufficient to meet the DoD Component's needs. For the final report, the DoD Component must require the recipient to use the SF-425 or other OMB-approved financial information collection.

(3) A DoD Component must obtain approval for any variations from OMB-approved forms or formats, including use of additional or substitute data elements or modification of the associated instructions for recipient entities submitting the information.

####### § 1134.210 Content of REP Article II.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify what financial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial reporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days after the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.

######## Required reporting form, format, or data elements for interim and final financial reports.

(2)In Section A of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-approved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the website where they can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports during the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed on the final report.

######## Interim financial reports: Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates.,e.g.,

(3)In Section B of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which recipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it is due. However, this section of the article may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information already provided with payment requests (on the SF-270).

######## e.g.,

(i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances (a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).

(ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.

(iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules-which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards-the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.

######## Final financial report.

(4)Appendix B to this part provides wording for Section C of REP Article II to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 provides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to recipients, the wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-award administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any information they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the wording or supplement it if the DoD Component has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.

######## Extensions of due dates.

(5)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording for Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim or final financial reports.

######## Where and how to submit financial reports.,e.g.,

(6)In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must submit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so (email or other electronic submission method).

###### Subpart C - Reporting on Property (REP Article III)

####### § 1134.300 Purposes of REP Article III.

REP Article III of the general terms and conditions provides a consolidated source that sets out required reports, notifications, requests, and accountings related to federally owned property and property that is acquired or improved under awards. The article is:

(a) The original source of requirements for recipients to:

(1) Submit periodic status reports and notifications of critical changes for real property (in paragraphs A.1 and A.2 of the article), which thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329;

(2) Submit an annual inventory of federally owned property (in paragraph C.1 of the article), which thereby partially implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a);

(3) Provide information on request about copyrighted works and data produced under awards (in paragraph D.2 of the article).

(b) A secondary source provided for the convenience of recipients and DoD post-award administrators that lists and refers to the original sources of requirements for recipients to:

(1) Request disposition instructions and account at closeout for real property (in paragraphs A.3 and A.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Article III and OAR Article VI;

(2) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for equipment (in paragraphs B.2 and B.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and IV, respectively;

(3) Account at closeout for equipment and supplies (in paragraph B.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in OAR Article VI and PROP Article IV;

(4) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for federally owned property (in paragraphs C.2 and C.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and V, respectively;

(5) Disclose and report on inventions developed under awards (in paragraph D.1), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI; and

(6) Request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards (in paragraph D.3 of the article), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI.

####### § 1134.305 Real property: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the real property reporting requirements described in § 1134.300(a)(1) and provide references to the related requirements described in § 1134.300(b)(1).

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the wording of Section A of REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

######## General.

(1)Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:

(i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic status reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real property). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which provides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real property.

######## e.g.,

(ii) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.b to specify the due date for each periodic status report in terms of the number of calendar days after the end of the period covered by the report (a report on the status of the property as of September 30 might be due 30 calendar days after that date).

######## e.g.,

(iii) May provide wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.c if there are other instructions-a form, format, or information elements that a recipient must use (which must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320) or a particular office to which reports must be submitted, especially if reporting will continue beyond closeout of the award under which the real property was acquired or improved.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section A of REP Article III if it determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions.

####### § 1134.310 Equipment and supplies: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.

######## Requirement.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that there is no requirement for routine periodic reporting about equipment acquired under an award and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(2) and (3) to requirements in other articles for notifications, requests, and accounting related to equipment and supplies.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of REP Article III.

####### § 1134.315 Federally owned property: inventory, notifications, and requests.

######## Requirement.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(4) to requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.

######## Policy.

(b)(1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:

(i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or

(ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.

(2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(c)-(1)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data elements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.

####### § 1134.320 Intangible property: disclosures, reports, and requests.

######## Requirement.

(a)REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(3) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(5) and (6) to requirements in other articles for disclosures, reports, and requests related to intangible property.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of REP Article III.

######## Exceptions.

(2)A DoD Component may reserve:

(i) Section D of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will have any intangible property for which they will be accountable to the Federal Government; or

(ii) Any of paragraphs D.1 through D.3, if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable to the Federal Government for the particular types of intangible property addressed by those paragraphs.

###### Subpart D - Reporting on Subawards and Executive Compensation (REP Article IV)

####### § 1134.400 Purpose of REP Article IV.

REP Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation.

####### § 1134.405 Content of REP Article IV.

######## Source of the reporting requirements.

(a)The requirements for recipients to report information about subawards and executive compensation originate in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended (31 U.S.C. 6101 note). OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 170 implements those statutory requirements and appendix A to that part provides standard Governmentwide wording of an award provision.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the reporting requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides as REP Article IV.

###### Subpart E - Other Reporting (REP Article V)

####### § 1134.500 Purpose of REP Article V.

REP Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for recipients to provide any type of report not addressed in REP Articles I-IV.

####### § 1134.505 Content of REP Article V.

##### PART 1136 - OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: GENERAL AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

###### Subpart A - Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information (OAR Article I)

####### § 1136.100 Purpose of OAR Article I.

OAR Article I sets forth requirements for recipients to maintain current information about themselves in the data system the Federal Government specifies as the repository for standard information about its business partners, currently the System for Award Management. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in:

(a) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);

(b) 2 CFR part 25; and

(c) The portion of 2 CFR 200.300(b) that cites 2 CFR part 25 and the System for Award Management).

####### § 1136.105 Content of OAR Article I.

To implement the requirement described in § 1136.100, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the standard wording appendix A to this part provides as OAR Article I. A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the article in its general terms and conditions if it is certain that there will be no award using those general terms and conditions for which the Federal share of the award's total value will exceed $500,000.

###### Subpart B - Records Retention and Access (OAR Article II)

####### § 1136.200 Purpose of OAR Article II.

OAR Article II addresses rights and responsibilities concerning retention of records related to awards; access to recipients' records; and collection, transmission, and storage of information. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.337.

####### § 1136.205 Records retention period.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) The lead-in paragraph of 2 CFR 200.333 sets a standard retention period that is generally applicable to recipient records pertinent to grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(c) and (f) provide different standard retention periods specifically for records that are related either to real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the standard retention periods described in paragraph (a) of this section.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(c)-(1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of OAR Article II.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may substitute alternative wording for paragraph A.3 of OAR Article II if the awards using those terms and conditions will be renewed quarterly or annually. The alternative wording for awards that will be renewed quarterly or annually would replace the words "final financial report" in paragraph A.3 with "quarterly financial report" or "annual financial report," respectively.

####### § 1136.210 Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.333(a) provides for an extended retention period for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(b) provides that a recipient also is required to extend the retention period when a Federal awarding, cognizant, or oversight agency notifies it in writing to do so.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)(1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended retention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).

(2)(i) Other than the exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require recipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).

(ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the "retention period," as that term is used in 2 CFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends beyond the standard 3-year retention period described in § 1136.205. That extension will enable disallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to retain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. Without that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which states that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient within the record retention period.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.215 Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333(e) provides the retention period for records related to program income earned under a grant or cooperative agreement after the end of the period of performance, if an agency establishes requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after that time.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions should not establish retention requirements for records related to program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Retention requirements for those records in general terms and conditions would be inconsistent with the statement in 2 CFR 1128.725 that a DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Section 1128.725 provides for use of general terms and conditions wording in FMS Article VII that establishes no such requirement. Section 1128.725 further states that exceptions for individual awards are properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of OAR Article II. If a DoD Component includes a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance, it also may include a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient's retention of the associated records.

####### § 1136.220 Records for joint or long-term use.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in:

(1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its custody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that the agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.

(2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention requirement.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that they may be asked to transfer records, maintain them for joint use, or retain them for a longer period.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section D of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.225 Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 addresses the use of electronic and paper formats in the collection, transmission, and storage of information related to awards.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include provisions consistent with the guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 for recipients' use of electronic and paper formats to collect, transmit, and store information.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section E of OAR Article II.

####### § 1136.230 Access to records.

######## OMB guidance.

(a)OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.336 and 200.337 addresses Federal Government and public access to recipient records related to grants and cooperative agreements.

######## DoD implementation.

(b)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for Federal Government access to records consistent with 2 CFR 200.336 and address public access to records to implement the guidance in 2 CFR 200.337.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(c)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section F of OAR Article II.

###### Subpart C - Remedies and Termination (OAR Article III)

####### § 1136.300 Purpose of OAR Article III.

OAR Article III addresses remedies for noncompliance, including suspension and termination of awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 through 200.340 and 200.342.

####### § 1136.305 Content of OAR Article III.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify remedies available for addressing noncompliance with award terms and conditions, policies and procedures related to termination of awards, and effects of suspension and termination on allowability of costs.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for OAR Article III.

###### Subpart D - Claims, Disputes, and Appeals (OAR Article IV)

####### § 1136.400 Purpose of OAR Article IV.

OAR Article IV addresses claims, disputes, and appeals under awards. It thereby provides the award terms and conditions required by the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 and also implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.341.

####### § 1136.405 Content of OAR Article IV.

######## Requirement.

(a)The DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 require DoD Components' general terms and conditions to incorporate the procedures set forth in that section for processing claims and disputes and deciding appeals of grants officer's decisions.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV, with wording inserted in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2 to identify the Component's cognizant Grant Appeal Authority and provide his or her mailing or email address.

######## Exception.

(2)A DoD Component may add one or more sections to the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV to state a requirement that recipients must provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters if:

(i) That requirement is in a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment; and

(ii) The statutory or regulatory requirement applies to awards using the DoD Component's general terms and conditions.

###### Subpart E - Collection of Amounts Due (OAR Article V)

####### § 1136.500 Purpose of OAR Article V.

OAR Article V addresses procedures for establishing, appealing, and collecting debts under DoD awards. It thereby:

(a) Provides requirements for recipients paralleling those for DoD Components in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.820;

(b) Augments requirements of OAR Article IV in any case in which a claim leads to a determination that a recipient owes an amount to DoD; and

(c) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.345.

####### § 1136.505 Content of OAR Article V.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how grants officers' decisions establish debts under awards, when debts become delinquent, how and when recipients may appeal, and how debts not paid in a timely manner are referred for debt collection.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides for OAR Article V.

###### Subpart F - Closeout (OAR Article VI)

####### § 1136.600 Purpose of OAR Article VI.

OAR Article VI addresses recipients' responsibilities for closeout of awards and subawards under them. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343.

####### § 1136.605 Content of OAR Article VI.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to closeout of awards and subawards, including recipients' liquidations of obligations, refunds of unobligated balances, and submission of final reports.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)-(1)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for OAR Article VI.

######## Exception related to due dates for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports.

(2)Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a), a DoD Component may grant extensions to due dates for final reports.

(i) To pre-approve a 30-day extension for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports, a DoD Component may substitute "120 calendar days" for "90 calendar days" in the wording appendix F to this part provides for paragraph C.4 of OAR Article VI. These pre-approved 30-day extensions in the general terms and conditions are for all awards using those terms and conditions; they therefore are separate and distinct from any additional extensions a recipient may later request for an individual award.

(ii) The parallel authorities for pre-approved extensions of due dates for final performance and invention reports are elsewhere. DoDGARs provisions in:

(A) 2 CFR 1134.125 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of performance reports by an appropriate substitution of wording in REP Article I of the general terms and conditions.

(B) 2 CFR 1130.610 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of final reports listing subject inventions under awards by an appropriate substitution of wording in PROP Article VI of the general terms and conditions.

(C) 2 CFR 1134.505 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of other types of final reports by inclusion of appropriate wording in REP Article V of the general terms and conditions.

####### § 1136.705 Content of OAR Article VII.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients with respect to funding adjustments and recipients' continuing responsibilities after award closeout.

######## Award terms and conditions.

(b)To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix G to this part provides for OAR Article VII.

###### § 1136.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning submission and maintenance of recipient information; records retention and access; remedies for noncompliance and termination; claims, disputes, and appeals; collection of amounts due; closeout; and after-the-award requirements.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in multiple portions of 2 CFR part 200, as those portions apply to general terms and conditions. Specifically, this part implements:

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

###### Appendix A to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article I, "Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information"

Unless a DoD Component reserves Section B, as specified in § 1136.105, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article I.

1. Unless you are exempted from this requirement in accordance with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 25.110, you must maintain the currency of information about yourself in the system the Federal Government specifies as the repository for information about its business partners (currently the System for Award Management (SAM)).

2. You must maintain the information in that system until you submit the final financial report required under this award or receive the final payment, whichever is later.

###### Appendix B to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article II, "Records Retention and Access"

Unless a DoD Component substitutes alternate wording in paragraph A.3, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article II, as specified in §§ 1136.205 through 1136.230.

####### Section A. Records retention period.

Except as provided in Sections B through D of this article:

1. You must keep records related to any real property and equipment acquired, in whole or in part, using Federal funds under the award for 3 years after final disposition of the property. For any item of exempt property with a current fair market value greater than $5,000, and for which final disposition was not a condition of the title vesting, you must keep whatever records you need for as long as necessary to ensure that you can deduct the Federal share if you later use the property in contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes under any Federal award.

2. You must keep records related to rate proposals for indirect or facilities and administrative costs, cost allocation plans, and supporting records such as indirect cost rate computations and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback or composite fringe benefit rates) as follows:

a. If you are required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computations to your Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, as the basis for negotiation of a rate, you must keep the submissions and all supporting records for 3 years from the date on which you were required to make the submissions.

b. If you are not required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computation as the basis for negotiation, you must keep the proposal, plan, other computation, and supporting records for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year or other accounting period covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

3. You must keep other financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records pertinent to this award for a period of 3 years from the date you submit your final financial report under the award.

1. If any litigation, claim, or audit begins before the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article and the final action related to the litigation, claim, or audit is not taken before the end of that 3-year period, you must retain all records related to this award that may be involved in the litigation, claim, or audit until all findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

2. We may disallow costs and recover funds under this award based on an audit or other review of records you elected to retain beyond the retention period required by this article, even if the audit or review begins after the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article. Thus, the "retention period," as that term is used in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344(a)(1), is extended, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b), to include the entire period during which we and our authorized representatives continue to have access to those records under paragraph F.2 of this article.

####### Section C. Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.

In accordance with Section F of FMS Article VII, there are no requirements under this award applicable to program income you earn after the end of the period of performance and therefore no associated records retention requirements.

####### Joint use.

1.To avoid duplicate recordkeeping for records that you and we both need to use on a continuous basis, we may ask you to make special arrangements with us, by mutual agreement, to make records available for joint and continuous use.

####### Long-term use.

2.If we determine that some records will be needed longer than the 3-year period specified in Section A of this article, we may request that you either:

a. Retain the records for a longer period of time; or

b. Transfer the records to our custody for long-term retention.

####### Retention requirements for transferred records.

3.For any records transferred to our custody, you are not subject to the records retention requirements in Section A of this article.

####### Section E. Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information

.

1. You should, whenever practicable, collect, transmit, and store information related to this award in open and machine-readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper. However, if you request it, we will:

a. Provide award related-information to you on paper; and

b. Accept award related-information from you on paper. In that case, we will not require more than an original and two copies.

2. When your original records are in an electronic form that cannot be altered, you do not need to create and retain paper copies of those records.

3. When your original records are on paper, you may substitute electronic versions produced through duplication or using other forms of electronic media, provided that:

a. You conduct periodic quality control reviews of the records;

b. You provide reasonable safeguards against alteration of the records; and

c. The records remain readable.

####### Scope of Federal Government access rights.

1.

a. We as the awarding agency, the Federal Government Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, and any of our authorized representatives have the right of access to any documents, papers, or other records you have that are pertinent to this award, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

b. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to your personnel for the purposes of interview and discussion related to the records.

c. As described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.336(b), the access to records described in this section will include access to the true name of a victim of a crime only under extraordinary and rare circumstances.

i. You are required to provide that access only in response to a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, or in response to a request duly authorized by the head of the DoD Component or his or her designee; and

ii. You must take appropriate steps to protect this sensitive information.

####### Duration of Federal Government access rights.

2.We have the access rights described in paragraph F.1 of this section as long as you retain the records.

####### Public access.

3.

####### e.g.,

a. You must comply with requirements to protect information that Federal statute, Executive order, or regulation requires to be protected (personally identifiable or export controlled information), to include both information generated under this award and information provided to you and identified as being subject to protection. Other than those limitations on dissemination of information, we place no restrictions on you that limit public access to your records pertinent to this award.

b. We do not place any requirements on you to permit public access to your records separate from any Federal, State, local, or tribal statute that may require you to do so.

c. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records in your possession but records you provide to us generally will be subject to FOIA, with the applicable exemptions.

###### Appendix C to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article III, "Remedies and Termination"

As required by § 1136.305, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article III.

####### Section A. Non-compliance with award terms and conditions

. If you fail to comply with a term or condition of this award or an applicable Federal statute or regulation, we may amend this award to impose award-specific conditions, as described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207. If imposing award-specific conditions, we will notify you before modifying the award and, once you have corrected the non-compliance, promptly remove the award-specific conditions. If we determine that the imposition of award-specific conditions is insufficient to correct the non-compliance or the non-compliance remains uncorrected despite the use of award-specific conditions, we may consider taking one or more of the remedies specified in Section B of this article.

1. If you fail to comply with a term or condition of this award or an applicable Federal statute or regulation, we may take one or more of the following actions that we deem appropriate to the circumstances:

a. Temporarily withhold cash payments pending:

i. Your correction of the deficiency; or

ii. Our taking more severe enforcement action.

b. Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable cost-sharing or matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;

c. Suspend or, in accordance with paragraph C.1.a.i of this article, terminate this award, in whole or in part (suspension of an award is a separate and distinct action from suspension of a person under 2 CFR parts 180 and 1125, as noted in paragraph B.3 of this article);

d. Withhold further awards to you for the project or program that is not in compliance;

e. Take any other action legally available to us under the circumstances.

2. You may raise an objection to our taking any remedy we take under paragraph B.1 of this section and will be given an opportunity to provide information and documentation challenging the action. The procedures are those specified in OAR Article IV for claims and disputes.

3. Our use of any remedy under paragraph B.1 of this section, including suspension or termination of the award, does not preclude our referring the noncompliance to a suspension and debarment official and asking that official to consider initiating a suspension or debarment action under 2 CFR part 1125, the DoD implementation of OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180.

1. This award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:

####### Unilaterally by the Federal Government.

a.We will provide a notice of termination if we unilaterally terminate this award in whole or in part, which we may do for either of the following reasons:

i. Your material failure to comply with the award terms and conditions. If we terminate the award for that reason, we will report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, each Federal awarding official must review and consider the information in the OMB-designated integrity and performance system with regard to any proposal or offer before awarding a grant or contract.

ii. The program office does not have funding for an upcoming increment if this award is incrementally funded. In that case, the Federal Government's financial obligation does not exceed the amount currently obligated under the award.

####### By mutual agreement.

b.With your consent, we may terminate this award, in whole or in part, for any reason. In that case, you and we must agree to:

i. The termination conditions, including the effective date; and

ii. In the case of a partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

####### Unilaterally by the recipient.

c.You may unilaterally terminate this award, in whole or in part, by sending us written notification that states:

i. The reasons for the termination;

ii. The effective date; and

iii. In the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. In that case, however, we may terminate the award in its entirety if we determine that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which we made the award.

2. If this award is terminated in its entirety before the end of the performance period, you must complete the closeout actions for which you are responsible under OAR Article VI. The due date for each action is to be measured relative to the date of termination.

3. If this award is only partially terminated before the end of the performance period, with a reduced or modified portion of the award continuing through the end of the performance period, then closeout actions will occur at the end of the performance period as specified in OAR Article VI.

4. You will continue to have all of the post-closeout responsibilities that OAR Article VII specifies for you if this award is wholly or partially terminated before the end of the performance period.

####### Section D. Effects of suspension or termination of the award on allowability of costs.

If we suspend or terminate this award prior to the end of the period of performance, costs resulting from obligations that you incurred:

1. Before the effective date of the suspension or termination are allowable if:

a. You properly incurred those obligations;

b. You did not incur the obligations in anticipation of the suspension or termination;

c. In the case of termination, the costs resulted from obligations that were noncancellable after the termination; and

d. The costs would have been allowable if we had not suspended or terminated the award and it had expired normally at the end of the period of performance.

2. During the suspension or after the termination are not allowable unless we expressly authorize them, either in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.

###### Appendix D to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article IV, "Claims, Disputes, and Appeals"

As specified in § 1136.405, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article IV, with the required insertion in paragraph A.2 of the article, along with any additional wording permitted by that section.

2.You will receive a written grants officer's decision if a DoD claim arises out of this award.

1. We encourage resolution of all issues related to this award by mutual agreement between you and the grants officer.

2. If you and the grants officer are unable to resolve an issue through unassisted negotiations, we encourage use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures to try to do so. ADR procedures are any voluntary means, such as mini-trials or mediation, used to resolve issues in controversy. ADR procedures may be used prior to submission of a claim or at any other time prior to the Grant Appeal Authority's decision on any appeal you submit.

1. Within 60 calendar days of receiving your claim, the grants officer will either:

a. Transmit a written decision that:

i. Identifies data on which the decision is based; and

ii. Identifies and provides the mailing address for the Grant Appeal Authority to whom you would submit an appeal of the decision if you elect to do so; or

b. If more time is required to render a written decision, notify you of a specific date when he or she will render the decision and inform you of the reason for delaying it.

2. The grants officer's decision will be final unless you decide to appeal, in which case we encourage use of ADR procedures as noted in Section C of this article.

####### Right to appeal.

1.You have the right to appeal a grants officer's decision to the Grant Appeal Authority identified in Section A of this article.

####### Notice of appeal.

2.You may appeal a grants officer's decision within 90 calendar days of receiving the decision by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Grant Appeal Authority and grants officer. If you elect to use ADR procedures, you are allowed an additional 60 calendar days to submit the written notice of appeal.

####### Appeal file.

3.Within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's receipt of your notice of appeal, you should receive the appeal file with copies of all documents relevant to the appeal. You may supplement the file with other documents you deem relevant and with a memorandum in support of your position for the Grant Appeal Authority's consideration. The Grant Appeal Authority may request additional information from you.

####### Decision.

4.Unless the Grant Appeal Authority decides to conduct fact-finding procedures or an oral hearing on the appeal, the appeal will be decided solely on the basis of the written record. Any fact-finding or hearing will be conducted using procedures that the Grant Appeal Authority deems appropriate.

####### Section F. Representation.

You may be represented by counsel or any other designated representative in any claim, appeal, or ADR proceeding, as long as the representative is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation from appearing before the DoD Component concerned.

####### Section G. Effect of Grant Appeal Authority's decision.

The Grant Appeal Authority's decision is the final administrative decision of DoD and cannot be further appealed within DoD.

####### Section H. Non-exclusivity of remedies.

Nothing in this article is intended to limit your right to any remedy under the law.

###### Appendix E to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article V, "Collection of Amounts Due"

As required by § 1136.505, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article V.

1. Any amount paid to you in excess of the amount to which you are determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of this award constitutes a debt to the Federal Government.

2. A grants officer will attempt to resolve any claim of your indebtedness arising out of this award by mutual agreement.

3. If the grants officer fails to resolve the claim in that manner, you will receive a written notice of the grants officer's decision formally determining the debt, as described in paragraph B.2 of OAR Article IV. The notice will describe the debt, including the amount, name and address of the official who determined the debt, and a copy of that official's determination.

1. Within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision, you must either pay the amount owed to the address provided in the written notice or inform the grants officer that you intend to appeal the decision. Appeal procedures are described in OAR Article IV.

2. If you elect not to appeal, any amounts not paid within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision will be a delinquent debt.

3. If you elect to appeal the grants officer's decision, you will have 90 calendar days after receipt of the grants officer's decision to file your appeal unless Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures are used, as described in section C of OAR Article IV, in which case you will have 150 calendar days.

1. If within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's decision, you neither pay the amount due nor provide notice of your intent to appeal the grants officer's decision, the grants officer will send you a demand letter identifying a payment office that will be responsible for any further debt collection activity.

2. If you do not pay by the due date specified in the written demand letter, the Federal Government may collect part or all of the debt by:

a. Making an administrative offset against your requests for reimbursements under Federal awards;

b. Withholding advance payments otherwise due to you; and

c. Any other action permitted by Federal statute.

3. The debt will bear interest, and may include penalties and other administrative costs, in accordance with applicable provisions of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD 7000.14-R), which implements the Federal Claims Collection Standards. The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

###### Appendix F to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article VI, "Closeout"

As required by § 1136.605, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article VI but may make a substitution in paragraph C.4 of the article as provided in that section.

####### Section A. Liquidation of obligations.

Unless the award administration office authorizes an extension of the due date, you must liquidate all obligations that you incurred under this award not later than 120 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance.

####### Section B. Refunds of unobligated balances.

You must promptly refund to the award administration office any balances of unobligated cash that we have advanced or paid to you and not authorized you to use on other projects or programs.

####### Section C. Final reports.

You must submit the:

1. Final performance report under this award no later than the date specified in Section C of REP Article I, subject to any extensions granted under Section D of that article;

2. Final financial report under this award no later than the date specified in Section C of REP Article II, subject to any extensions granted under Section D of that article;

3. Final report listing subject inventions made under the award no later than the date specified in Section B of PROP Article VI; and

####### Section D. Accounting for property.

You must account for any real property, equipment, supplies, and intangible property that you and any subrecipients acquired or improved under the award, in accordance with PROP Articles I through IV and VI. Your requests for disposition instructions for any federally owned property, as required by PROP Article V, meet the need described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.343(f) to account for that property at closeout.

###### Appendix G to Part 1136 - Terms and Conditions for OAR Article VII, "Post-Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities"

As required by § 1136.705, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article VII.

####### Section A. Adjustments.

The closeout of this award does not affect:

1. Our right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review, as long as we make the determination that the costs are disallowed and notify you about that determination within the extended records retention period specified in paragraph B.2 of OAR Article II of these terms and conditions.

2. Your obligation to return any funds due to the Federal Government as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions (to include any adjustments in final indirect cost rates).

###### Subpart L - Fixed-Amount Subawards (SUB Article XII)

####### § 1138.1200 Purpose of SUB Article XII.

SUB Article XII specifies policy and procedures concerning recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.201(b) and 200.332 and other portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to fixed-amount subawards.

####### § 1138.1205 Content of SUB Article XII.

######## Requirement.

(a)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a fixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements the recipient must include in those subawards.

######## Award terms and conditions,General.

(b)- (1)A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII.

######## Exceptions.

(2)

(i) In addition to the authorities provided in § 1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add wording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the Component's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the program or programs that use its general terms and conditions.

(ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix L provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, well-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being reimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.

###### § 1138.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning recipients' award and administration of subawards under DoD grants and cooperative agreements.

(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in Subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and 2 CFR parts 25, 170, and 180, as they apply to subawards.

###### § 1138.2 Applicability of this part.

The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.

###### § 1138.3 Exceptions from requirements of this part.

Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.

###### § 1138.4 Organization of this part.

(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.

(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.

(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart and the authorization in § 1138.5, which permit a DoD Component to vary from the standard wording in some situations.

(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through L to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through L, respectively, as supplemented by the authorization in § 1138.5):

###### § 1138.5 Authority to omit or reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII.

A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:

(a) Omit SUB Articles II through XII that are the subject of this part if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to make subawards under awards using those terms and conditions. The DoD Component also may amend SUB Article I in that case, to state the prohibition on making subawards and limit the recipient's responsibility to ensuring that any transaction it awards at the next tier is a procurement transaction.

(b) Reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII that do not apply to the DoD Component's awards using those terms and conditions. For example, the DoD Component may reserve paragraphs in SUB Articles IV through IX specifying administrative requirements that flow down solely to subawards to States if it determines that there is no possibility of a subaward to a State under any of the awards using its general terms and conditions. Similarly, it may reserve SUB Article XII if it does not permit any fixed-amount subawards under its awards.

###### Appendix A to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article I, "Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article I.

####### Section A. Required recipient determination.

For each transaction into which you enter with another entity at the next tier below this award, you must determine whether the transaction is a subaward or a procurement.

1. The primary purpose of the transaction between you and the other entity is the key factor you must use to determine whether the transaction is a subaward or a procurement.

a. The transaction is a subaward and the other entity therefore a subrecipient if the transaction's primary purpose is for you to transfer-for performance by the other entity-a portion of the substantive program for which we are providing financial assistance to you through this award. You will continue to be accountable to us for performance of the project or program under the award, including portions performed by any subrecipients.

b. The transaction is a procurement and the other entity therefore your contractor if the transaction's primary purpose is for you to purchase goods or services that you need to perform the substantive program supported by this award. The distinction from a subaward is the contractor is not performing a portion of the substantive program as a result of the transaction.

2. What you call the transaction is not a factor in distinguishing a subaward from a procurement. If the transaction meets the criterion in paragraph B.1.a of this article, it is a subaward for purposes of the requirements of this award even if you call and consider the transaction a "contract."

####### Process for awarding the transaction.

1.One important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier transaction is a subaward or a procurement is that there are different requirements governing the pre-award and time of award processes that you use to award the transaction.

a. SUB Article II of this award specifies pre-award and time of award responsibilities for subawards.

b. PROC Articles I and II of this award govern pre-award and time of award processes for awarding procurement transactions.

####### Transaction terms and conditions.

2.A second important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier transaction is a subaward or a procurement is that the terms and conditions you include in a subaward differ from those you include in a procurement transaction.

a. Section C of SUB Article II of this award addresses requirements you must include in subaward terms and conditions. Those requirements generally are either identical or directly related to requirements in the general terms and conditions of this award. They include national policy requirements as well as administrative requirements in areas such as financial and programmatic management, property administration, procurement, and reporting.

b. PROC Article III of this award lists requirements you must include in a procurement transaction when applicable to the procurement.

###### Appendix B to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article II, "Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article II.

####### Definition of "entity."

1.For purposes of the unique entity identifier requirements in paragraphs A.2 and 3 of this section, "entity" has the meaning given in paragraph C.3 of appendix A to OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.

####### Pre-notification of potential subrecipients.

2.You must notify potential subrecipients that no entity may receive a subaward from you under this award unless it has provided its unique entity identifier to you.

####### Restriction on making subawards.

3.

####### General.

a.You may not make a subaward to an entity unless the entity has provided its unique entity identifier to you.

####### Exception.

b.You may make a subaward to an entity that has not provided its unique entity identifier to you in rare cases in which you requested, and we approved, an exemption from the requirement for the entity to provide a unique entity identifier, based on the criteria in OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.110(d).

1. Before making a subaward to an entity, you must perform a risk assessment of the prospective subrecipient, as described in 2 CFR 200.331(b). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(c) provides examples of factors you may consider in evaluating risk.

2. As part of the risk assessment under paragraph B.1 of this article, you must:

a. Verify that neither the prospective subrecipient nor its principals under the subaward are excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction, in accordance with requirements in Subpart C of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; and

b. If warranted by risks you identify, determine whether to impose award-specific terms and conditions in the subaward to mitigate the risks.

i. These award-specific terms and conditions may be in addition to, or differ from, the terms and conditions that SUB Articles IV through IX of this award require you to include in subawards.

ii. They may include items such as those listed in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(b)(1) through (6).

iii. Your procedures for imposing and removing the additional or different requirements must comply with the procedural guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(c) and (d).

####### Cost-type subawards.

1.

a. SUB Article III of this award specifies informational content that you must include in each cost-type subaward.

b. SUB Articles IV through VIII specify administrative requirements that you must include:

i. As applicable, in each cost-type subaward to:

####### i.e.,

(A) A domestic U.S. entity (an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or

(B) An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and

ii. To the maximum extent practicable in each cost-type subaward to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.

c. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each cost-type subaward.

####### Fixed-amount type subawards.

2.

a. Sections A through F of SUB Article III of this award specify informational content that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward.

b. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each fixed-amount subaward.

c. Section D of SUB Article XII of this award specifies administrative requirements that you must include, as applicable, in any fixed-amount subaward to:

####### i.e.,

i. A domestic U.S. entity (an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or

ii. An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and

iii. To the maximum extent practicable to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.

####### Additional subaward terms and conditions.

3.You may include other requirements in your subawards that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program (including portions performed by subrecipients) and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.

####### Section D. Subaward and executive compensation reporting.

You must report subaward obligating actions and information on subrecipients' executive compensation as required by REP Article IV of this award.

###### Appendix C to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article III, "Informational Content of Subawards"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article III.

####### Section A. Informational content in general.

You must include in each subaward (and each subsequent amendment to a subaward that alters the amount of the subaward) the information specified in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1), "Federal Award Identification," with the clarifications provided in Sections B through G of this article.

####### Section B. Federal award identification number and award date.

The "Federal Award Identification Number" and "Federal Award Date" described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), respectively, are the award number and award date for this award to you. You must provide the information in a way that makes it clear that the subaward is under this DoD award.

1. The "Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass-through entity to the subrecipient" that is described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vi) is either:

a. The amount of your obligation to the subrecipient, if the terms and conditions of this award do not require you to provide any cost sharing or matching for the project or program the award supports; or

b. The amount of the Federal share of your subaward obligation if this award does require cost sharing or matching, which in that case is the product of:

i. The Federal share of total project costs under this DoD award to you, as a percentage of those total project costs; and

ii. The total amount of project costs obligated for the subaward action.

2. Note that the total project costs of the award and subaward, as used in paragraphs C.1.b.i and ii of this section, include any cost sharing or matching that you or the subrecipient provides if you are counting it toward the cost sharing or matching required under this award.

####### Section D. Total amount obligated to the subrecipient.

The "Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the Subrecipient by the pass-through entity including the current obligation," as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vii), is the cumulative amount to date of the amounts described in Section C of this article.

####### Section E. Total Amount of the Federal Award.

The "Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity," as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(viii), is the total amount through the end of the subaward that you and the subrecipient mutually agreed upon, to include: Funding obligated to date, any future anticipated funding increments, and any options you may exercise in the future.

####### Section F. Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, and awarding official.

The "Name of Federal awarding agency" and "pass-through entity," as those terms are used in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(x) are the DoD and the business name associated with your registration in SAM. In that same paragraph of 2 CFR part 200, the "awarding official" is the individual in your organization who made the subaward.

####### Section G. Indirect cost rate.

With respect to the requirement in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(xiii) for the subaward to include the "Indirect cost rate for the Federal award:"

1. This requirement applies to cost-type subawards only.

2. The rate the subaward must include is the subrecipient's rate, whether it is a rate set by negotiation with a Federal agency or you or is the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f).

3. You are required to include the indirect cost rate only if the subrecipient is willing to share that information with you and assents that information about its rate is not proprietary. If a subrecipient is not willing to share information about its indirect cost rate with you, consult the grants officer for this award to explore alternative ways to assess the reasonableness of costs of the subaward.

###### Appendix D to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article IV, "Financial and Program Management Requirements for Subawards"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article IV.

1. This article specifies administrative requirements concerning financial and program management that you must include in the terms and conditions of each cost-type subaward that you make under this award to a domestic entity.

2. It thereby addresses the flow down to subrecipients of requirements with which you must comply under FMS Articles I through VII of this award.

3. SUB Article XII of this award addresses which of these administrative requirements you must include in any fixed-amount subaward that you make, if you are authorized to make fixed-amount subawards under this award.

####### Section B. Financial management system standards.

You must include in any subaward you make under this award the requirements of:

1. Sections A through C of FMS Article I of this award if the subrecipient is a State;

####### Payment method.

a.

i. If you are authorized to request advance payments under this award, you must authorize a subrecipient to request advance payments unless:

(A) The subrecipient does not maintain, or demonstrate the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of each payment and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes;

(B) You impose a requirement for the subrecipient to be paid by reimbursement as a result of your risk evaluation of the subrecipient under SUB Article II of this award.

(C) The subaward is for construction.

ii. If you do not authorize advance payments for one of the reasons given in paragraph C.2.a.i of this article, you must specify either reimbursement or working capital advances as the payment method in accordance with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(3) and (4).

####### Payment timing and amount.

b.

####### Advances.

i.You must limit advance payments to the minimum amounts needed and time the payments to be in accordance with the subrecipient's actual, immediate cash requirements in carrying out the project or program under the subaward. The timing and amount of your advance payments to the subrecipient must be as close as is administratively feasible to the subrecipient's actual disbursements for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. Your subawards also must include the requirements of paragraphs B.2.b and c of FMS Article II to specify costs subrecipients must exclude from amounts of their advance payment requests.

####### Reimbursements or working capital advances.

ii.You must follow OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(3) and (4) concerning timing and amount of reimbursements or working capital advances.

####### Frequency of requests.

c.You must allow the subrecipient to request advance payments or reimbursements, including those associated with the working capital advance payment method, as often as it wishes if you pay using electronic funds transfers and at least monthly otherwise.

####### Other requirements.

d.

i. In any subaward that was subject to our consent, you must include the requirements of paragraph B.5 of FMS Article II of this award concerning withholding of payments.

1. You must include in each cost-type subaward a requirement that the allowability of costs under the subaward (and any lower-tier subawards or procurement transactions into which the subrecipient enters) must be determined in accordance with the applicable cost principles identified in Section A of FMS Article III of this award, as well as the clarification in Section B of that article if it applies to those cost principles.

2. You must specify in each subaward the period of availability of funds for any project or program purpose so that the period neither begins before nor ends after the period during which you may use funds available to you under this award for that same project or program purpose.

3. You must include in each subaward the provisions concerning fee or profit that are in Section D of FMS Article III of this award.

####### Section E. Revision of budget and program plans.

You must include in each subaward provisions requiring the subrecipient to request your approval for any change in the subaward budget or program that would cause a budget or program change under this award for which Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to first obtain our prior approval. You may not approve any budget or program revision that is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of this award.

####### Section F. Non-Federal audits.

You must include a provision in each subaward that you make under this award to require the subrecipient entity to comply with the audit requirements applicable to that entity, as specified in either Section A or Section B of FMS Article V.

####### Section G. Cost sharing or matching requirements.

If you make a subaward under which the subrecipient may provide contributions or donations of cash or third-party in-kind contributions to be counted toward any cost sharing or matching that is required under this award, you must include provisions in that subaward to specify:

1. The criteria governing the allowability as cost sharing or matching of the types of cash or third-party in-kind contributions that the subrecipient may contribute or donate. Those criteria are specified in:

a. Sections B through D of FMS Article VI of this award if the subaward is to a State, institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.

b. The provisions of 32 CFR 34.13(a) if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.

You must include requirements concerning program income in subawards, as follows:

1. In each subaward to a State, institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe:

a. You must require the subrecipient to account to you when it earns any program income under the subaward or uses it, so that you can prepare reports you are required to submit to us. If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award require you to account for program income earned after the period of performance, you must include a corresponding requirement in your subawards.

b. You must include the provisions of Sections A through D of FMS Article VII of this award.

c. You may specify the deduction, addition, or cost-sharing or matching alternative-described in 2 CFR 1128.720(b)-or a combination of those alternatives, for the subrecipient's use of any program income it earns. However, you still must comply with the alternative specified in Section E of FMS Article VII and any applicable award-specific terms and conditions for the total amount of program income earned, which includes amounts earned by you and your subrecipients. For example, if we require you to use the deduction alternative, you may authorize a subrecipient to use the addition alternative if you reduce the funding allocated for portions of the project or program that you or other subrecipients perform to make the required reduction in the total award amount.

2. In each subaward to a for-profit entity, you must include the provisions of 32 CFR 34.14, with the appropriate method specified for disposition of program income.

You must comply with any statute or regulation that affords the subrecipient an opportunity for a hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding and is applicable to the dispute.

####### Section F. Collection of amounts due.

Although your subaward terms and conditions do not need to include any of the requirements of OAR Article V because those requirements do not flow down to subrecipients, you should consider including provisions to specify what you would need from the subrecipient if you owed a debt to the Federal Government under this award that is related to its subaward.

1. In each subaward that you make to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe, you must include provisions to require the subrecipient to:

####### Section A. General requirement for subrecipient monitoring.

You must do the post-award monitoring of the subrecipient's activities under each subaward that is needed in order for you to ensure that:

1. The subrecipient carries out the portion of the substantive project or program under this award.

2. The subrecipient is using funds under the subaward (including any cost sharing or matching the subrecipient provides that is counted as project costs in the approved budget of this award) for authorized purposes.

3. The subrecipient's performance under the subaward is in compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of your subaward.

####### Required monitoring actions under cost-type subawards.

###### Appendix K to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article XI, "Requirements Concerning Subrecipients' Lower-Tier Subawards"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article XI.

####### Section A. Purpose.

This article specifies requirements you must include in any cost-type subaward under which you determine that the subrecipient of your subaward may make lower-tier cost-type subawards to other entities. Paragraph G.1 of SUB Article XII specifies requirements related to fixed-amount type subawards at lower tiers.

####### Section B. Requirements for lower-tier subawards.

Your cost-type subaward terms and conditions must require your subrecipient, with respect to each lower-tier cost-type subaward that it makes, to:

1. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination that SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.

2. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.

3. Include in any cost-type subaward it makes at the next tier:

a. The informational content that SUB Article III specifies;

b. The administrative requirements that SUB Articles IV through VIII of this award specify;

c. The national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable; and

d. The requirements of this article if the next-tier subrecipient may make even lower-tier cost-type subawards to other entities.

4. Carry out the subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration responsibilities specified in SUB Article X of this award.

###### Appendix L to Part 1138 - Terms and Conditions for SUB Article XII, "Fixed-Amount Subawards"

Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5 or 1138.1205, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article XII.

1. You may not use a fixed-amount subaward:

a. If the total value over the life of the subaward will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

b. Unless the project or program scope is specific, with definite outcomes, and you are able to establish a reasonable estimate of the actual costs of accomplishing those outcomes.

c. If you will predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under the subaward.

d. If the subrecipient will acquire any real property or equipment under the subaward.

2. For fixed-amount subawards not prohibited by paragraph 1 of this section and except as provided in Section B of this article, you must obtain our prior approval before making a fixed-amount type of subaward.

a. If Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to obtain our prior approval before you make any subaward, and you do not identify the subaward as a fixed-amount subaward when you obtain that approval, then you must subsequently request separate approval before awarding it as a fixed-amount type of subaward.

b. If a subaward is identified as a fixed-amount type of subaward in the budget you submit for our approval, then our approval of the budget is the required prior approval.

####### Section B. Fixed-amount subawards that do not require prior approval.

You are not required to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward if:

1. The subaward is to either:

a. A foreign public entity; or

b. An organizational unit of a foreign organization, if that unit does not have a place of business in the United States, regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one.

2. You determine that the portion of the project or program under this award which the subrecipient will be carrying out under the subaward has one or more specific outcomes with the following characteristics:

a. You can define the outcomes well enough to specify them at the time you make the subaward. Note that:

i. Outcomes are distinct from inputs needed to achieve the outcomes, such as amounts or percentages of time that subrecipient employees or other participants will spend on the project or program.

ii. The inherently unpredictable nature of basic or applied research makes it rarely, if ever, possible to define specific research outcomes in advance, which makes fixed-amount subawards inappropriate for research. Note that technical performance reports serve to document research outcomes but are not themselves outcomes, notwithstanding the definition of "performance goals" in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.76.

b. The accomplishment of each outcome will be observable and verifiable by you when it occurs, so that you will not need to rely solely on the subrecipient's assurance of that accomplishment.

c. The subrecipient associates its estimated costs with outcomes in the proposal it submits to you, and you are confident that the costs of accomplishment of the outcomes will equal or exceed the subaward amount. This requires either that you have a high degree of confidence:

i. In your estimate of the costs associated with accomplishing the well-defined and observable outcomes, based on the prospective subrecipient's proposal (and using the applicable cost principles in FMS Article III as a guide); or

ii. That those costs will be within a finite range, rather than a specific amount, so that you may provide an amount of funding under the subaward that does not exceed the lower end of the range, with the provision that the subrecipient agrees to provide any balance above that amount that ultimately is needed to accomplish the outcomes. Your subaward then would include a term or condition to reflect the subrecipient's agreement to provide that balance (which would be in an amount to be post-determined, when the outcomes are accomplished). Note that this is distinct from a situation in which you predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under its subaward, a situation in which paragraph A.1.c of this article prohibits use of a fixed-amount subaward.

3. a. The subaward is based on a fixed rate per unit of outcome (or "unit cost") and you have both the confidence:

i. That is described in paragraph B.2.c of this article in the estimated costs associated with each unit of outcome; and

####### i.e.,

ii. In the subrecipient's guarantee that it can accomplish at least the number of units of outcome on which your total subaward amount will be based (the product of the unit cost and the number of units of outcome the subrecipient guarantees to accomplish).

b. Note, however, that not every fixed rate subaward is also a fixed-amount subaward. If you have confidence in the unit cost but not also in the subrecipient's ability to guarantee the number of units of outcome that it will accomplish, then you should set a not-to-exceed award amount based on the number of units desired and reduce the subaward amount at the end if the subrecipient accomplishes fewer than that number. Examples of activities for which it may be appropriate to award this type of fixed rate subaward that is not a fixed-amount subaward include:

i. A clinical trial for which the unit cost is the cost of treating each participant. The not-to-exceed amount would be based on the number of participants the subrecipient planned to recruit and the final award on the number who actually participated, documentation for which would be subject to audit.

ii. Labor costs for performance of a portion of the project or program under this award by a for-profit entity that treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information. The unit cost in that case may be "loaded" labor rates for the entity's employees that include indirect costs. The final award amount would depend on the number of labor hours the entity's employees expended under the subaward, documentation for which may be audited without exposing proprietary details associated with the actual costs.

####### Section C. Informational content of fixed-amount subawards.

You must include in each fixed-amount subaward the informational content, other than the indirect cost rate, that is described in SUB Article III of this award.

####### General.

1.This section:

a. Specifies the minimum set of terms and conditions (in lieu of the more extensive set specified in SUB Articles IV through X for cost-type subawards) addressing administrative requirements that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward:

i. To an entity other than a foreign organization, as applicable; and

ii. To the maximum extent practicable, to a foreign organization.

b. Does not preclude the inclusion of other requirements that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.

####### Financial and program management requirements.

2.

####### Financial management system standards.

a.For a subaward to other than a for-profit entity, your subaward must require the subrecipient to include the information specified in paragraph B.1 of FMS Article I in its financial management system, for the purposes of the non-Federal audits required by paragraph 2.d of this section.

####### Payments.

b.Your payments must be based on accomplishment of the outcomes and associated costs that you used to establish the award amount, rather than on subrecipient expenditures for project or program purposes. Milestone payments before the end of the subaward's period of performance may be appropriate if there are outcomes that the subrecipient will accomplish at different times during that period.

####### Revision of budget and program plans.

c.If our prior approval was required under paragraph A.2 of this article for use of a fixed-amount type of subaward, then you must:

i. Request our prior approval for any change in scope or objective of the subaward; and

ii. Include a requirement in the subaward for the subrecipient to request that approval through you.

####### Non-Federal audits.

d.You must include the requirement for non-Federal audits described in Section F of SUB Article IV. The audits are intended to focus on compliance with the performance requirements in the subaward terms and conditions and not to review actual costs as they would for a cost-type subaward.

####### Property requirements.

3.

####### Federally owned property

a.. If the subrecipient will be accountable for federally owned property, you must include the property management system, use, and disposition requirements described in Sections C and F of SUB Article V that are applicable to federally owned property.

####### Intangible property.

b.You must include the applicable intangible property requirements described in Section G of SUB Article V.

####### Reporting requirements.

4.You must include requirements for reporting that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for reporting to us.

####### Other administrative requirements.

5.

####### Integrity-related information.

a.You must include the substance of the provision in Section C of OAR Article I in any subaward you make under this award. The provision must require the subrecipient's disclosure of any evidence directly to the Inspector General, DoD.

####### Records retention and access

b..

i. You must include the requirements for records retention and access in paragraph A.3 and Sections B and F of OAR Article II, as applicable, if the subaward is to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe. You may not impose any other records retention or access requirements on the subrecipient.

ii. You must include the corresponding requirements of 32 CFR 34.42 if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.

####### Remedies and termination.

c.You must include:

i. The requirements concerning remedies and termination that are described in paragraphs D.1 and 2 of SUB Article VIII;

ii. Provisions addressing any hearing and appeal rights the subrecipient has, as described in Section E of SUB Article VIII; and

iii. Terms and conditions addressing adjustment of the amount of the subaward if it is terminated before the subrecipient accomplishes all of the specified outcomes.

####### Continuing responsibilities.

d.You must include requirements concerning continuing responsibilities for audits and records retention and access that are described in paragraphs B.1 and 3 of OAR Article VII.

####### Collection of amounts due.

e.You should consider including requirements concerning collection of amounts due, as described in Section F of SUB Article VIII.

####### Section E. National policy requirements for fixed-amount subawards.

You must include in the terms and conditions of each fixed-amount subaward the national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable.

####### Section F. Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration.

You must carry out the subrecipient monitoring and post-award administration actions specified in SUB Article X, as applicable.

####### Authority.

1.

a. If Section B of this article authorizes you to use a fixed-amount type of subaward without our prior approval in some situations, a cost-type subaward that you make may authorize the subrecipient to use fixed-amount subawards at the next lower tier in those same situations without our prior approval.

####### i.e.,

b. If you wish to allow a subrecipient of a cost-type subaward to use fixed-amount subawards at the next tier in other situations (situations in which this article requires you to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward), your subaward terms and conditions must require the subrecipient to submit a request through you to obtain our prior approval for use of that type of subaward.

####### Subaward requirements.

2.If your subrecipient is authorized to use lower-tier fixed-amount subawards, as described in paragraphs 1.a and b of this section, your subaward's terms and conditions must:

a. Require the subrecipient, before it makes any lower-tier fixed-amount subaward, to:

i. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination that SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.

ii. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.

b. Include the requirements specified in Sections A through F of this article.

The review system should include three phases: Initial Screening, Threshold Screening, and a Merit Review Evaluation Screening. Bureaus and offices may remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass the basic eligibility screening per paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.

####### Completeness.,Grants.gov

(e)Bureaus and offices may return applications/proposals that are incomplete or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of theannouncement to the applicant to be corrected, modified, or supplemented, or may reject the application/proposal outright.

####### Merit Review Evaluation Screening.,i.e.,

(h)This is the final review stage where the technical merit of the application/proposal is reviewed. In the absence of a program rule or statutory requirement, program officials shall develop criteria that include all aspects of technical merit. Bureaus and offices shall develop criteria that are conceptually independent of each other, but all-encompassing when taken together. While criteria will vary, the basic criteria shall focus reviewers' attention on the project's underlying merit (significance, approach, and feasibility). The criteria shall focus not only on the technical details of the proposed project but also on the broader importance or potential impact of the project. The criteria shall be easily understood.

####### Risk assessments.

(i)Bureaus and offices must also consider risk thresholds during application/proposal review process. Elements to be considered may include organization; single audit submissions, past performance; availability of necessary resources, equipment, or facilities; financial strength and management capabilities; and procurement procedures; or procedures for selecting and monitoring subrecipients or sub-vendors, if applicable. For all non-Federal entities that receive an award, the Financial Assistance Officer must document the risk analysis.

####### Requirements for proposal evaluators.

(j)Upon receipt of a Memorandum of Appointment, each proposal evaluator and advisor must sign and return a Conflict of Interest Certificate to the Financial Assistance Officer. If an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the appointee may not evaluate or provide advice on a potential applicant's proposal until the conflict has been resolved or mitigated. Further, each proposal evaluator or advisor must agree to comply with any notice or limitation placed on the application. Upon completion of the review, the proposal evaluator or advisor shall return or destroy all copies of the application and accompanying proposals (or abstracts) to DOI; and unless authorized by the Financial Assistance Officer or agency designee, the reviewer shall not contact the non-Federal entity concerning any aspect of the application.

(2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).

(d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.

####### Indirect cost rate deviation required by statute or regulation.

(1)In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.

####### Indirect cost rate reductions used as cost-share.

(2)Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.

####### Programmatic indirect cost rate deviation approval process.

(3)Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:

####### Program qualifications.

(i)Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.

####### Deviation requests.

(ii)Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.

####### Approvals.

(iii)Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.

####### Voluntary indirect cost rate reduction.

(4)On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.

####### Unrecovered indirect costs.

(5)In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.

####### § 1500.8 Program income.

######## Governmental revenues.

(a)Permit fees are governmental revenue and not program income. (See 2 CFR 200.307(c)).

######## Use of program income.

(b)The default use of program income for EPA awards is addition even if the amount of program income the non-Federal entity generates exceeds the anticipated amount at time of the award of the assistance agreement. Unless the terms of the agreement provide otherwise, recipients may deduct costs incidental to the generation of program income from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to any Federal award. (See 2 CFR 200.307(b)). The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the assistance agreement. (See 2 CFR 200.307(e)(2)).

######## Brownfields Revolving Loan.

(c)To continue the mission of the Brownfields Revolving Loan fund, recipients may use EPA grant funding prior to using program income funds generated by the revolving loan fund. Recipients may also keep program income at the end of the assistance agreement as long as they use these funds to continue to operate the revolving loan fund or some other brownfield purpose as outlined in their respective closeout agreements.

######## Other revolving loan programs.

(d)Recipients of EPA funding for other revolving loan fund programs may use EPA grant funding prior to using program income funds generated by the revolving loan fund.

This paragraph (d) does not apply to EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs which are subject to their own regulations.

####### § 1500.9 Revision of budget and program plans.

######## Pre-award Costs.

EPA award recipients may incur allowable project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award. Expenses more than 90 calendar days pre-award require prior approval of EPA. All costs incurred before EPA makes the award are at the recipient's risk. EPA is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive a Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs.

###### Procurement Standards

####### § 1500.10 General procurement standards.

(a) EPA will limit its participation in the salary rate (excluding overhead) paid to individual consultants retained by recipients, and their contractors or subcontractors to the maximum daily rate for level 4 of the Executive Schedule unless a greater amount is authorized by law. (These non-Federal entities may, however, pay consultants more than this amount with non-EPA funds.) The limitation in this paragraph (a) applies to consultation services of designated individuals with specialized skills who are paid at a daily or hourly rate. This rate does not include transportation and subsistence costs for travel performed; recipients will pay these in accordance with their normal travel reimbursement practices.

(b) All contracts between recipients and subrecipients and individual consultants are subject to the procurement standards in subpart D of 2 CFR part 200. Contracts or subcontracts with multi-employee firms for consulting services are not affected by the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section provided the contractor or subcontractor rather than the recipient or subrecipient selects, directs and controls individual employees providing consulting services.

(c) Borrowers under EPA revolving loan fund capitalization grant programs are not subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

####### § 1500.11 Use of the same architect or engineer during construction.

(a) If the recipient is satisfied with the qualifications and performance of the architect or engineer who provided any or all of the facilities planning or design services for a waste-water treatment works project and wishes to retain that firm or individual during construction of the project, it may do so without further public notice and evaluation of qualifications, provided:

(1) The recipient received a facilities planning (Step 1) or design grant (Step 2), and selected the architect or engineer in accordance with EPA's procurement regulations in effect when EPA awarded the grant; or

(2) The award official approves noncompetitive procurement under 2 CFR 200.320(c)(4) for reasons other than simply using the same individual or firm that provided facilities planning or design services for the project; or

(3) The recipient attests that:

(i) The initial request for proposals clearly stated the possibility that the firm or individual selected could be awarded a contract for services during construction; and

(ii) The firm or individual was selected for facilities planning or design services in accordance with procedures specified in this section.

(iii) No employee, officer or agent of the recipient, any member of their immediate families, or their partners have financial or other interest in the firm selected for award; and

(iv) None of the recipient's officers, employees or agents solicited or accepted gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors or other parties to contracts.

(b) However, if the recipient uses the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to retain an architect or engineer, any Step 3 contracts between the architect or engineer and the grantee must meet all other procurement provisions in 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.327.

####### Dispute

(d)is a disagreement by an Affected Entity with a specific Agency Decision submitted to the DDO in accordance with this subpart.

####### Dispute Decision Official (DDO)

(e)is the designated agency official responsible for issuing a decision resolving a Dispute.

(1) The DDO for a Headquarters Dispute is the Director of the Grants and Interagency Agreement Management Division in the Office of Grants and Debarment or designee. To provide for a fair and impartial review, the AO for the challenged Agency Decision may not serve as the Headquarters DDO.

(2) The DDO for a Regional Assistance Agreement Dispute is the Regional Administrator or the official designated by the Regional Administrator to issue the written decision resolving the Dispute. To provide for a fair and impartial review, the AO for the challenged Agency Decision may not serve as the Regional DDO.

###### § 1500.15 Submission of Dispute.

An Affected Entity or its authorized representative may dispute an Agency Decision by electronically submitting a Dispute to the DDO identified in the Agency Decision. In order for the DDO to consider the Dispute, it must satisfy the following requirements:

####### Timeliness.

(a)The DDO must receive the Dispute no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Agency Decision is electronically sent to the Affected Entity. The DDO will dismiss any Dispute received after the 30-day period unless the DDO grants an extension of time to submit the Dispute. The Affected Entity must submit a written request for extension to the DDO before the expiration of the 30-day period. The DDO may grant a one-time extension of up to 30 calendar days when justified by the situation, which may include the unusual complexity of the Dispute or because of exigent circumstances.

####### Method of submission.

(b)The Affected Entity must submit the Dispute electronically via email to the DDO, with a copy to the AO, using the email addresses specified in the Agency Decision within the 30-day period stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

####### Contents of Dispute.

(c)The Dispute submitted to the DDO must include:

(1) A copy of the disputed Agency Decision;

(2) A detailed statement of the specific legal and factual grounds for the Dispute, including copies of any supporting documents;

###### § 1500.16 Notice of receipt of Dispute to Affected Entity.

Within 15 calendar days of receiving the Dispute, the DDO will provide the Affected Entity a written notice, sent electronically, acknowledging receipt of the Dispute.

####### Timely Disputes.

(a)If the Dispute was timely submitted, the notice of acknowledgement may identify any additional information or documentation that is required for a thorough consideration of the Dispute. The notice should provide no more than 30 calendar days for the Affected Entity to provide the requested information. If it is not feasible to identify such information or documentation in the notice the DDO may request it at a later point in time prior to issuance of the Dispute decision.

####### Untimely Disputes.

(b)If the DDO did not receive the Dispute within the required 30-day period, or any extension of it, the DDO will notify the Affected Entity that the Dispute is being dismissed as untimely and the Agency Decision of the AO becomes final. The dismissal of an untimely Dispute constitutes the final agency action. In appropriate circumstances, the DDO may, as a matter of discretion, consider an untimely Dispute if doing so would be in the interests of fairness and equity.

###### § 1500.17 Determination of Dispute.

(a) In determining the merits of the Dispute, the DDO will consider the record related to the Agency Decision, any documentation that the Affected Entity submits with its Dispute, any additional documentation submitted by the Affected Entity in response to the DDO's request under § 1500.16(a), and any other information the DDO determines is relevant to the Dispute provided the DDO gives notice of that information to the Affected Entity. The Affected Entity may not on its own initiative submit any additional documents except in the support of a request for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) The DDO will issue the Dispute decision within 180 calendar days from the date the Dispute is received by the DDO unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented. The DDO will notify the Affected Entity if the expected decision will not be issued within the 180-day period and if feasible will indicate when the decision is expected to be issued. The DDO will issue the Dispute decision electronically and advise the Affected Entity of procedures for requesting reconsideration. The DDO's decision will constitute the final agency action unless the Affected Entity electronically petitions the DDO for reconsideration within 15 calendar days of issuance of the DDO Decision. The Affected Entity must include a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds warranting reversal or modification of the DDO decision. In addition, the Affected Entity may submit additional documents that were not previously provided to the DDO.

(c) If a petition for reconsideration is submitted, the DDO's will advise the Affected Entity within 15 calendar days of receipt of the petition whether the DDO Decision will be reconsidered. The DDO will issue this determination electronically. DDO's will only grant a reconsideration petition if the Affected Entity provides relevant and material evidence that was not available to the Affected Entity at the time the Dispute was submitted or to correct a clear and prejudicial error of fact or law. Denial of a petition for reconsideration constitutes final agency action and the DDO will advise the Affected Entity of the reasons for denying the reconsideration in writing.

(d) If the DDO grants a reconsideration petition, the DDO will issue a revised DDO Decision within 30 calendar days of acceptance of the reconsideration petition unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented. The DDO will issue the revised DDO Decision electronically. The revised DDO Decision and any new material considered by the DDO in making the revised DDO Decision will become part of the record of the Dispute. The revised DDO Decision will constitute final agency action.

(e) The DDO may consider untimely filed reconsideration petitions only if necessary, to correct a DDO Decision that is manifestly unfair and inequitable in light of relevant and material evidence that the Affected Entity could not have discovered during the 15-calendar day period for petitioning for reconsideration. This evidence must be submitted within six months of the date of the DDO Decision. The DDO will advise the Affected Entity within 30 days of receipt of an untimely filed reconsideration petition whether the DDO will accept the petition. Denial of an untimely filed reconsideration petition constitutes final agency action.

###### § 1532.1110 How will a CAA or CWA conviction affect my eligibility to participate in Federal contracts, subcontracts, assistance, loans and other benefits?

If you are convicted of any offense described in § 1532.1105, you are automatically disqualified from eligibility to receive any contract, subcontract, assistance, sub-assistance, loan or other nonprocurement benefit or transaction that is prohibited by a Federal department or agency under the Governmentwide debarment and suspension system (i.e. covered transactions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or prohibited awards under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), if you:

(a) Will perform any part of the transaction or award at the facility giving rise to your conviction (called the violating facility); and

(b) You own, lease or supervise the violating facility.

###### § 1532.1115 Can the EPA extend a CAA or CWA disqualification to other facilities?

The CAA specifically authorizes the EPA to extend a CAA disqualification to other facilities that are owned or operated by the convicted person. The EPA also has authority under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to take discretionary suspension and debarment actions on the basis of misconduct leading to a CAA or CWA conviction, or for activities that the EPA debarring official believes were designed to improperly circumvent a CAA or CWA disqualification.

###### § 1532.1120 What is the purpose of CAA or CWA disqualification?

As provided for in Executive Order 11738 (3 CFR, 1973 Comp., p. 799), the purpose of CAA and CWA disqualification is to enforce the Federal Government's policy of undertaking Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities in a manner that improves and enhances environmental quality by promoting effective enforcement of the CAA or CWA.

###### § 1532.1125 How do award officials and others know if I am disqualified?

####### http://www.epls.gov.

If you are convicted under these statutes, the EPA enters your name and address and that of the violating facility into the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) as soon as possible after the EPA learns of your conviction. In addition, the EPA enters other information describing the nature of your disqualification. Federal award officials and others who administer Federal programs consult the EPLS before entering into or approving procurement and nonprocurement transactions. Anyone may access the EPLS through the internet, currently at

###### § 1532.1130 How does disqualification under the CAA or CWA differ from a Federal discretionary suspension or debarment action?

(a) CAA and CWA disqualifications are exclusions mandated by statute. In contrast, suspensions and debarments imposed under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, are exclusions imposed at the discretion of Federal suspending or debarring officials. This means that if you are convicted of violating the CAA or CWA provisions described under § 1532.1105, ordinarily your name and that of the violating facility is placed into the EPLS before you receive a confirmation notice of the listing, or have the opportunity to discuss the disqualification with, or seek reinstatement from, the EPA.

(b) CAA or CWA disqualification applies to both the person convicted of the offense, and to the violating facility during performance of an award or covered transaction under the Federal procurement and nonprocurement suspension and debarment system. It is the EPA's policy to carry out CAA and CWA disqualifications in a manner which integrates the disqualifications into the Governmentwide suspension and debarment system. Whenever the EPA determines that the risk presented to Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities on the basis of the misconduct which gives rise to a person's CAA or CWA conviction exceeds the coverage afforded by mandatory disqualification, the EPA may use its discretionary authority to suspend or debar a person under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.

###### § 1532.1135 Does CAA or CWA disqualification mean that I must remain ineligible?

You must remain ineligible until the EPA debarring official certifies that the condition giving rise to your conviction has been corrected. If you desire to have your disqualification terminated, you must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official and support your request with persuasive documentation. For information about the process for reinstatement see §§ 1532.1205 and 1532.1300.

###### § 1532.1140 Can an exception be made to allow me to receive an award even though I may be disqualified?

(a) After consulting with the EPA debarring official, the head of any Federal department or agency (or designee) may exempt any particular award or a class of awards with that department or agency from CAA or CWA disqualification. In the event an exemption is granted, the exemption must:

(1) Be in writing; and

(2) State why the exemption is in the paramount interests of the United States.

(b) In the event an exemption is granted, the exempting department or agency must send a copy of the exemption decision to the EPA debarring official for inclusion in the official record.

###### § 1532.1200 How will I know if I am disqualified under the CAA or CWA?

There may be several ways that you learn about your disqualification. You are legally on notice by the statutes that a criminal conviction the CAA or CWA automatically disqualifies you. As a practical matter, you may learn about your disqualification from your defense counsel, a Federal contract or award official, or from someone else who sees your name in the EPLS. As a courtesy, the EPA will attempt to notify you and the owner, lessor or supervisor of the violating facility that your names have been entered into the EPLS. The EPA will inform you of the procedures for seeking reinstatement and give you the name of a person you can contact to discuss your reinstatement request.

###### § 1532.1205 What procedures must I follow to have my procurement and nonprocurement eligibility reinstated under the CAA or CWA?

(a) You must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official stating what you believe the conditions were that led to your conviction, and how those conditions have been corrected, relieved or addressed. Your request must include documentation sufficient to support all material assertions you make. The debarring official must determine that all the technical and non-technical causes, conditions and consequences of your actions have been sufficiently addressed so that the Government can confidently conduct future business activities with you, and that your future operations will be conducted in compliance with the CAA and CWA.

(b) You may begin the reinstatement process by having informal discussions with the EPA representative named in your notification of listing. Having informal dialogue with that person will make you aware of the EPA concerns that must be addressed. The EPA representative is not required to negotiate conditions for your reinstatement. However, beginning the reinstatement process with informal dialogue increases the chance of achieving a favorable outcome, and avoids unnecessary delay that may result from an incomplete or inadequate reinstatement request. It may also allow you to resolve your disqualification by reaching an agreement with the EPA debarring official under informal procedures. Using your informal option first does not prevent you from submitting a formal reinstatement request with the debarring official at any time.

###### § 1532.1210 Will anyone else provide information to the EPA debarring official concerning my reinstatement request?

If you request reinstatement under § 1532.1205, the EPA debarring official may obtain review and comment on your request by anyone who may have information about, or an official interest in, the matter. For example, the debarring official may consult with the EPA Regional offices, the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies, or state, tribal or local governments. The EPA debarring official will make sure that you have an opportunity to address important allegations or information contained in the administrative record before making a final decision on your request for reinstatement.

###### § 1532.1215 What happens if I disagree with the information provided by others to the EPA debarring official on my reinstatement request?

(a) If your reinstatement request is based on factual information (as opposed to a legal matter or discretionary conclusion) that is different from the information provided by others or otherwise contained in the administrative record, the debarring official will decide whether those facts are genuinely in dispute, and material to making a decision. If so, a fact-finding proceeding will be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 180.830 through 180.840, and the debarring official will consider the findings when making a decision on your reinstatement request.

(b) If the basis for your disagreement with the information contained in the administrative record relates to a legal issue or discretionary conclusion, or is not a genuine dispute over a material fact, you will not have a fact-finding proceeding. However, the debarring official will allow you ample opportunity to support your position for the record and present matters in opposition to your continued disqualification. A summary of any information you provide orally, if not already recorded, should also be submitted to the debarring official in writing to assure that it is preserved for the debarring official's consideration and the administrative record.

###### § 1532.1220 What will the EPA debarring official consider in making a decision on my reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official will consider all information and arguments contained in the administrative record in support of, or in opposition to, your request for reinstatement, including any findings of material fact.

(b) The debarring official will also consider any mitigating or aggravating factors that may relate to your conviction or the circumstances surrounding it, including any of those factors that appear in 2 CFR 180.860 that may apply to your situation.

(c) Finally, if disqualification applies to a business entity, the debarring official will consider any corporate or business attitude, policies, practices and procedures that contributed to the events leading to conviction, or that may have been implemented since the date of the misconduct or conviction. You can obtain any current policy directives issued by the EPA that apply to CAA or CWA disqualification or reinstatement by contacting the Office of the EPA Debarring Official, U.S. EPA, Office of Grants and Debarment (3901R), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.

###### § 1532.1225 When will the EPA debarring official make a decision on my reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official will make a decision regarding your reinstatement request under § 1532.1205(a), when the administrative record is complete, and he or she can determine whether the condition giving rise to the CAA or CWA conviction has been corrected-usually within 45 days of closing the administrative record.

(b) A reinstatement request is not officially before the debarring official while you are having informal discussions under § 1532.1205(b).

###### § 1532.1230 How will the EPA debarring official notify me of the reinstatement decision?

The EPA debarring official will notify you of the reinstatement decision in writing, using the same methods for communicating debarment or suspension action notices under 2 CFR 180.615.

###### § 1532.1300 Can I resolve my eligibility status under terms of an administrative agreement without having to submit a formal reinstatement request?

(a) The EPA debarring official may, at any time, resolve your CAA or CWA eligibility status under the terms of an administrative agreement. Ordinarily, the debarring official will not make an offer to you for reinstatement until after the administrative record for decision is complete, or contains enough information to enable him or her to make an informed decision in the matter.

(b) Any resolution of your eligibility status under the CAA or CWA resulting from an administrative agreement must include a certification that the condition giving rise to the conviction has been corrected.

(c) The EPA debarring official may enter into an administrative agreement to resolve CAA or CWA disqualification issues as part of a comprehensive criminal plea, civil or administrative agreement when it is in the best interest of the United States to do so.

###### § 1532.1305 What are the consequences if I mislead the EPA in seeking reinstatement or fail to comply with my administrative agreement?

(a) Any certification of correction issued by the EPA debarring official whether the certification results from a reinstatement decision under §§ 1532.1205(a) and 1532.1230, or from an administrative agreement under §§ 1532.1205(b) and 1532.1300, is conditioned upon the accuracy of the information, representations or assurances made during development of the administrative record.

(b) If the EPA debarring official finds that he or she has certified correction of the condition giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction or violation on the basis of a false, misleading, incomplete or inaccurate information; or if a person fails to comply with material condition of an administrative agreement, the EPA debarring official may take suspension or debarment action against the person(s) responsible for the misinformation or noncompliance with the agreement as appropriate. If anyone provides false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information to EPA in an attempt to obtain reinstatement, the EPA debarring official will refer the matter to the EPA Office of Inspector General for potential criminal or civil action.

###### § 1532.1400 How may I appeal a decision denying my request for reinstatement?

(a) If the EPA debarring official denies your request for reinstatement under the CAA or CWA, you can ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:

(1) You may ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; and/ or

(2) You may request the Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD Director), to review the debarring official's denial within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 1532.1230 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the OGD Director can reverse the debarring official's decision denying reinstatement only where the OGD Director finds that there is a clear error of material fact or law, or where the OGD Director finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing and state the specific findings you believe to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

(c) A review under this section is solely within the discretion of the OGD Director.

(d) The OGD Director must notify you of his or her decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.

###### § 1532.1500 If I am reinstated, when will my name be removed from the EPLS?

If your eligibility for procurement and nonprocurement participation is restored under the CAA or CWA, whether by decision, appeal, or by administrative agreement, the EPA will remove your name and that of the violating facility from the EPLS, generally within 5 working days of your reinstatement.

###### § 1532.1600 What definitions apply specifically to actions under this subpart?

In addition to definitions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that apply to this part as a whole, the following two definitions apply specifically to CAA and CWA disqualifications under this subpart:

(a) Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, state, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a state, or any interstate body.

(b) Violating facility means any building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, location or site of operations that gives rise to a CAA or CWA conviction, and is a location at which or from which a Federal contract, subcontract, loan, assistance award or other covered transactions may be performed. If a site of operations giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction contains or includes more than one building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, or other operational element, the entire location or site of operation is regarded as the violating facility unless otherwise limited by the EPA.

##### § 1532.10 What does this part do?

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the EPA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

####### § 1800.400 Policy guide.

Payment of fee or profit is consistent with an activity whose principal purpose is the acquisition of goods and services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government, rather than an activity whose principal purpose is Federal financial assistance to a recipient to carry out a public purpose. Therefore, the Grants Officer shall use a procurement contract, rather than a grant or cooperative agreement, in all cases where fee or profit is to be paid to the recipient of the instrument or the instrument is to be used to carry out a program where fee or profit is necessary to achieving program objectives. Grants and cooperative agreements shall not provide for the payment of any fee or profit to the recipient.

##### § 1800.1 Authority.

###### et seq.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awards grants and cooperative agreements under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), the National Aeronautics and Space Act. This part 1800 is issued under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), Pub. L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 1003 (31 U.S.C. 6301), and 2 CFR part 200.

##### § 1800.2 Purpose.

This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

##### § 1800.3 Applicability.

(a) This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by NASA to non-Federal entities, for-profit organization, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101. For supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.

(1) Non-Federal entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.

(2) Foreign organizations and foreign public entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through E of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.

(3) U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR parts 30 and 31 take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E of 2 CFR part 200 for Federal awards to U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations.

(b) Throughout this part, the term "award" refers to both "grant" and "cooperative agreement" unless otherwise indicated.

(c)(1) In general, research with foreign organizations will not be conducted through grants or cooperative agreements, but instead will be accomplished on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. In these cases, NASA enters into agreements undertaking projects of international scientific collaboration. NASA's policy on performing research with foreign organizations on a no-exchange-of-funds basis is set forth at NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) at 48 CFR 1835.016-70 and 1835.016-72. In rare instances, NASA may enter into an international agreement under which funds will be transferred to a foreign recipient.

(2) Grants or cooperative agreements awarded to foreign organizations are made on an exceptional basis only. Awards require the prior approval of the Headquarters Office of International and Interagency Relations and the Headquarters Office of the General Counsel. Requests to issue awards to foreign organizations are to be coordinated through the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Policy Division.

##### Subpart J - Limited Denial of Participation

###### § 2424.1100 What is a limited denial of participation?

A limited denial of participation excludes a specific person from participating in a specific program, or programs, within a HUD field office's geographic jurisdiction, for a specific period of time. A limited denial of participation is normally issued by a HUD field office, but may be issued by a Headquarters office. The decision to impose a limited denial of participation is discretionary and based on the best interests of the federal government.

###### § 2424.1105 Who may issue a limited denial of participation?

The Secretary designates HUD officials who are authorized to impose a limited denial of participation, affecting any participant and/or their affiliates, except mortgagees approved by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

###### § 2424.1110 When may a HUD official issue a limited denial of participation?

(a) An authorized HUD official may issue a limited denial of participation against a person, based upon adequate evidence of any of the following causes:

(1) Approval of an applicant for insurance would constitute an unsatisfactory risk;

(2) There are irregularities in a person's past performance in a HUD program;

(3) The person has failed to maintain the prerequisites of eligibility to participate in a HUD program;

(4) The person has failed to honor contractual obligations or to proceed in accordance with contract specifications or HUD regulations;

(5) The person has failed to satisfy, upon completion, the requirements of an assistance agreement or contract;

(6) The person has deficiencies in ongoing construction projects;

(7) The person has falsely certified in connection with any HUD program, whether or not the certification was made directly to HUD;

(8) The person has committed any act or omission that would be cause for debarment under 2 CFR 180.800;

(9) The person has violated any law, regulation, or procedure relating to the application for financial assistance, insurance, or guarantee, or to the performance of obligations incurred pursuant to a grant of financial assistance or pursuant to a conditional or final commitment to insure or guarantee;

(10) The person has made or procured to be made any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way an action of the Department; or

(11) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office.

(b) Filing of a criminal Indictment or Information shall constitute adequate evidence for the purpose of limited denial of participation actions. The Indictment or Information need not be based on offenses against HUD.

(c) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office shall constitute adequate evidence for a concurrent limited denial of participation. Where such a concurrent limited denial of participation is imposed, participation may be restricted on the same basis without the need for an additional conference or further hearing.

(d) An affiliate or organizational element may be included in a limited denial of participation solely on the basis of its affiliation, and regardless of its knowledge of or participation in the acts providing cause for the sanction. The burden of proving that a particular affiliate or organizational element is currently responsible and not controlled by the primary sanctioned party (or by an entity that itself is controlled by the primary sanctioned party) is on the affiliate or organizational element.

###### § 2424.1115 When does a limited denial of participation take effect?

A limited denial of participation is effective immediately upon issuance of the notice.

###### § 2424.1120 How long may a limited denial of participation last?

A limited denial of participation may remain in effect up to 12 months.

###### § 2424.1125 How does a limited denial of participation start?

A limited denial of participation is made effective by providing the person, and any specifically named affiliate, with notice:

(a) That the limited denial of participation is being imposed;

(b) Of the cause(s) under § 2424.1110 for the sanction;

(c) Of the potential effect of the sanction, including the length of the sanction and the HUD program(s) and geographic area affected by the sanction;

(d) Of the right to request, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a conference under § 2424.1130; and

(e) Of the right to contest the limited denial of participation under § 2424.1130.

###### § 2424.1130 How may I contest my limited denial of participation?

(a) Within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation, you may request a conference with the official who issued such notice. The conference shall be held within 15 days after the Department's receipt of the request for a conference, unless you waive this time limit. The official or designee who imposed the sanction shall preside. At the conference, you may appear with a representative and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, or within 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials, the official or designee shall, in writing, advise you of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation. If all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is affirmed, the notice of affirmation shall advise you of the opportunity to contest the notice and to request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. You have 30 days after receipt of the notice of affirmation to request this hearing. If the official or designee does not issue a decision within the 20-day period, you may contest the sanction before a Departmental Hearing Officer. Again, you have 30 days from the expiration of the 20-day period to request this hearing. If you request a hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500.

(b) You may skip the conference with the official and you may request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. This must also be done within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation. If you opt to have a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500. The hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer is more formal than the conference before the sanctioning official described above. The Departmental Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing in accordance with 24 CFR part 26, subpart A. The Departmental Hearing Officer will issue findings of fact and make a recommended decision. The sanctioning official will then make a final decision, as promptly as possible, after the Departmental Hearing Officer's recommended decision is issued. The sanctioning official may reject the recommended decision or any findings of fact, only after specifically determining that the decision or any of the facts are arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

(c) In deciding whether to terminate, modify, or affirm a limited denial of participation, the Departmental official or designee may consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860. The Departmental Hearing Officer may also consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860 in making any recommended decision.

###### § 2424.1135 Do Federal agencies coordinate limited denial of participation actions?

Federal agencies do not coordinate limited denial of participation actions. As stated in § 2424.1100, a limited denial of participation is a HUD-specific action and applies only to HUD activities.

###### § 2424.1140 What is the scope of a limited denial of participation?

The scope of a limited denial of participation is as follows:

(a) A limited denial of participation generally extends only to participation in the program under which the cause arose. A limited denial of participation may, at the discretion of the authorized official, extend to other programs, initiatives, or functions within the jurisdiction of an Assistant Secretary. The authorized official, however, may determine that where the sanction is based on an indictment or conviction, the sanction shall apply to all programs throughout HUD.

(b) For purposes of this subpart, participation includes receipt of any benefit or financial assistance through grants or contractual arrangements; benefits or assistance in the form of loan guarantees or insurance; and awards of procurement contracts.

(c) The sanction may be imposed for a period not to exceed 12 months, and shall be effective within the geographic jurisdiction of the office imposing it, unless the sanction is imposed by an Assistant Secretary or Deputy Assistant Secretary, in which case the sanction may be imposed on either a nationwide or a more restricted basis.

###### § 2424.1145 May HUD impute the conduct of one person to another in a limited denial of participation?

For purposes of determining a limited denial of participation, HUD may impute conduct as follows:

####### Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization.

(a)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

####### Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual or between individuals.

(b)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the improper conduct.

####### Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization.

(c)HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

###### § 2424.1150 What is the effect of a suspension or debarment on a limited denial of participation?

If you have submitted a request for a hearing pursuant to § 2424.1130 of this subpart, and you also receive, pursuant to subpart G or H of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based on the same transaction(s) or the same conduct as the limited denial of participation, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, the following rules shall apply:

(a) During the 30-day period after you receive a notice of proposed debarment or suspension, during which you may elect to contest the debarment under 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, all proceedings in the limited denial of participation, including discovery, are automatically stayed.

(b) If you do not contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with respect to the limited denial of participation, to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation.

(c) If you contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, then:

(1) Those parts of the limited denial of participation and the debarment or suspension based on the same transaction(s) or conduct, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, shall be immediately consolidated before the debarring or suspending official;

(2) Proceedings under the consolidated portions of the limited denial of participation shall be stayed before the hearing officer until the suspending or debarring official makes a determination as to whether the consolidated matters should be referred to a hearing officer. Such a determination must be made within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the suspension or proposed debarment, unless the suspending/debarring official extends the period for good cause.

(i) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, the entire consolidated matter will be referred to the hearing officer hearing the limited denial of participation, for additional proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR 180.750 or 180.845.

(ii) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is no dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, jurisdiction of the hearing officer under 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J, to hear those parts of the limited denial of participation based on the same transaction[s] or conduct as the debarment or suspension, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, will be transferred to the debarring or suspending official, and the hearing officer responsible for hearing the limited denial of participation shall transfer the administrative record to the debarring or suspending official.

(3) The suspending or debarring official shall hear the entire consolidated case under the procedures governing suspensions and debarments, and shall issue a final decision as to both the limited denial of participation and the suspension or debarment.

###### § 2424.1155 What is the effect of a limited denial of participation on a suspension or a debarment?

The imposition of a limited denial of participation does not affect the right of the Department to suspend or debar any person under this part.

###### § 2424.1160 May a limited denial of participation be terminated before the term of the limited denial of participation expires?

If the cause for the limited denial of participation is resolved before the expiration of the 12-month period, the official who imposed the sanction may terminate it.

###### § 2424.1165 How is a limited denial of participation reported?

When a limited denial of participation has been made final, or the period for requesting a conference pursuant to § 2424.1130 has expired without receipt of such a request, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify the Director of the Compliance Division in the Departmental Enforcement Center of the scope of the limited denial of participation.

Notices or announcements of award opportunities and notices of award or contracts shall include language substantially similar to that in appendices A and B, respectively, to 34 CFR part 75.

(3) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee in administering Federal financial services from the Department shall require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices where they are not required of non-faith-based organizations. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds shall apply equally to faith-based and non-faith-based organizations. All organizations that participate in Department programs or services, including organizations with religious character or affiliation, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, subject to any required or appropriate religious accommodation, and other applicable requirements governing the conduct of Department-funded activities, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities.

(4) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee shall disqualify faith-based organizations from participating in Department-funded programs or services because such organizations are motivated or influenced by religious faith to provide social services, or because of their religious character or affiliation, or on grounds that discriminate against organizations on the basis of the organizations' religious exercise, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(c)(1) The provisions of 34 CFR 75.532 and 76.532 that apply to a faith-based organization that is a grantee or subgrantee also apply to a faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State.

(2) The requirements referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides goods or services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(d)(1) A private organization that provides direct Federal services under a program of the Department and engages in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services funded by the Department through a contract with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State. Attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the contract must be voluntary.

(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).

(e)(1) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, will retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance.

(2) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may, among other things-

(i) Retain religious terms in its name;

(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;

(f) A private organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program goods or services on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program and may require attendance at all activities that are fundamental to the program.

(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a), is not forfeited when the organization contracts with a grantee or subgrantee. An organization qualifying for such an exemption may select its employees on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization.

(h) No grantee or subgrantee receiving funds under any Department program or service shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

#### PART 3485 - NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

##### Subpart A - General

###### § 3485.137 May the Department grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

(a) Yes, the Secretary delegates to the ED Deciding Official the authority under this section to grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction.

(b) If the ED Deciding Official grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the Governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

##### Subpart B - Covered Transactions

###### § 3485.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part-

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210 of this title, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to Part 3485-Covered Transactions.

(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.

(4) The contract is to perform services as a third party servicer in connection with a title IV, HEA program.

(c) In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by ED under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the ED nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in Appendix A to Part 3485-Covered Transactions).

##### Subpart C - Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

###### § 3485.310 What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or ED grants an exception under § 3485.137.

(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant, you may not continue a title IV, HEA transaction with an excluded person after the effective date of the exclusion unless permitted by 34 CFR 668.26, 682.702, or 668.94, as applicable.

###### § 3485.315 May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or, if ED took the action, an ED deciding official grants an exception under § 3485.137.

(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant-

(1) You may not renew or extend the term of any contract or agreement for the services of an excluded person as a principal with respect to a title IV, HEA transaction; and

(2) You may not continue to use the services of that excluded person as a principal under this kind of an agreement or arrangement more than 90 days after you learn of the exclusion or after the close of the Federal fiscal year in which the exclusion takes effect, whichever is later.

###### § 3485.330 What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

(a) Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to-

(1) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You must do so using the method specified in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(2) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

(b) To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

(c) The failure of a participant to include a requirement to comply with Subpart C of 2 CFR part 180 in the agreement with a lower tier participant does not affect the lower tier participant's responsibilities under this part.

##### Subpart D - Responsibilities of the Department's Officials Regarding Transactions

###### § 3485.415 What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?

(a) You as a Federal agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 3485.137.

####### Title IV, HEA transactions.

(c)If you are a title IV, HEA participant-

(1) You may not renew or extend the term of any contract or agreement for the services of an excluded person as a principal with respect to a title IV, HEA transaction; and

(2) You may not continue to use the services of that excluded person as a principal under this kind of an agreement or arrangement more than 90 days after you learn of the exclusion or after the close of the Federal fiscal year in which the exclusion takes effect, whichever is later.

###### § 3485.437 What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in § 180.435 of this title?

To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12 and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

##### Subpart E [Reserved]

##### Subpart F - General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions

###### § 3485.611 What procedures do we use for a suspension or debarment action involving a title IV, HEA transaction?

(a) If we suspend a title IV, HEA participant under Executive Order 12549, we use the following procedures to ensure that the suspension prevents participation in title IV, HEA transactions:

(1) The notification procedures in § 180.715 of this title.

(2) Instead of the procedures in §§ 180.720 through 180.760 of this title, the procedures in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.

(3) In addition to the findings and conclusions required by 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, the suspending official, and, on appeal, the Secretary determines whether there is sufficient cause for suspension as explained in § 180.700 of this title.

(b) If we debar a title IV, HEA participant under E.O. 12549, we use the following procedures to ensure that the debarment also precludes participation in title IV, HEA transactions:

(1) The notification procedures in §§ 180.805 and 180.870 of this title.

(2) Instead of the procedures in §§ 180.810 through 180.885 of this title, the procedures in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.

(3) On appeal from a decision debarring a title IV, HEA participant, we issue a final decision after we receive any written materials from the parties.

(4) In addition to the findings and conclusions required by 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, the debarring official, and, on appeal, the Secretary determines whether there is sufficient cause for debarment as explained in § 180.800 of this title.

###### § 3485.612 When does an exclusion by another agency affect the ability of the excluded person to participate in a title IV, HEA transaction?

(a) If a title IV, HEA participant is debarred by another agency under E.O. 12549, using procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, that party is not eligible to enter into title IV, HEA transactions for the duration of the debarment.

(b)(1) If a title IV, HEA participant is suspended by another agency under E.O. 12549 or under a proposed debarment under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), using procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, that party is not eligible to enter into title IV, HEA transactions for the duration of the suspension.

(2)(i) The suspension of title IV, HEA eligibility as a result of suspension by another agency lasts for at least 60 days.

(ii) If the excluded party does not object to the suspension, the 60-day period begins on the 35th day after that agency issues the notice of suspension.

(iii) If the excluded party objects to the suspension, the 60-day period begins on the date of the decision of the suspending official.

(3) The suspension of title IV, HEA eligibility does not end on the 60th day if-

(i) The excluded party agrees to an extension; or

(ii) Before the 60th day we begin a limitation or termination proceeding against the excluded party under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or part 682, subpart D or G.

(c)(1) If a title IV, HEA participant is debarred or suspended by another Federal agency-

(i) We notify the participant whether the debarment or suspension prohibits participation in title IV, HEA transactions; and

(ii) If participation is prohibited, we state the effective date and duration of the prohibition.

(2) If a debarment or suspension by another agency prohibits participation in title IV, HEA transactions, that prohibition takes effect 20 days after we mail notice of our action.

(3) If the Department or another Federal agency suspends a title IV, HEA participant, we determine whether grounds exist for an emergency action against the participant under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.

(4) We use the procedures in § 3485.611 to exclude a title IV, HEA participant excluded by another Federal agency using procedures that did not meet the standards in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) If a title IV, HEA participant is excluded by another agency, we debar, terminate, or suspend the participant-as provided under this part, 34 CFR part 668, or 34 CFR part 682, as applicable-if that agency followed procedures that gave the excluded party-

(1) Notice of the proposed action;

(2) An opportunity to submit and have considered evidence and argument to oppose the proposed action;

(3) An opportunity to present its objection at a hearing-

(i) At which the agency has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence that there is cause for the exclusion; and

(ii) Conducted by an impartial person who does not also exercise prosecutorial or investigative responsibilities with respect to the exclusion action;

(4) An opportunity to present witness testimony, unless the hearing official finds that there is no genuine dispute about a material fact;

(5) An opportunity to have agency witnesses with personal knowledge of material facts in genuine dispute testify about those facts, if the hearing official determines their testimony to be needed, in light of other available evidence and witnesses; and

(6) A written decision stating findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the decision is rendered.

##### Subpart G - Suspension

###### § 3485.711 When does a suspension affect title IV, HEA transactions?

(a) A suspension under § 3485.611(a) takes effect immediately if the Secretary takes an emergency action under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, at the same time the Secretary issues the suspension.

(b)(1) Except as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, a suspension under § 3485.611(a) takes effect 20 days after those procedures are complete.

(2) If the respondent appeals the suspension to the Secretary before the expiration of the 20 days under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the suspension takes effect when the respondent receives the Secretary's decision.

##### Subpart J [Reserved]

##### § 3485.12 What does this part do?

(a)(1) The Department of Education (the "Department" or "ED") adopts subparts A through I of the Office of Management and Budget guidance in 2 CFR part 180. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension" (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, "Debarment and Suspension" (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

(2) The table of contents for this part contains only those sections in part 3485 that include supplements to the guidance in part 180 and new sections needed to implement the guidance for the Department's programs. In those sections of the OMB guidance that are supplemented, the section in part 3485 includes both the text of the OMB guidance that is not affected by the change and any additional paragraphs that need to be added to the OMB guidance. For example, § 180.220 of this title contains only paragraphs (a) and (b). The text of § 3485.220, which supplements § 180.220 to extend lower-tier transactions to certain transactions below the primary tier, includes both the text of paragraph (a) and (b) of § 180.220 and the text of added paragraph (c).

(3) In those sections in part 180 that do not have paragraph designations and that the Department supplements, the section in this part implementing the OMB guidance designates the undesignated paragraph from part 180 as paragraph (a) and the first supplemental paragraph as paragraph (b). For example, 2 CFR 180.330 includes an undesignated lead in paragraph and two subparagraphs designated (a) and (b). In § 3485.330, the undesignated paragraph in 2 CFR 180.330 is designated paragraph (a) and the two subparagraphs are designated paragraphs (1) and (2). The added paragraphs are designated paragraph (b) and (c).

(b) The authority for all the provisions in 2 CFR part 180 as adopted in this part is listed as follows.

##### § 3485.22 Does this part apply to me?

This part applies to you if you are-

(a) A participant or principal in a "covered transaction" (see subpart B of this part and the definition of "nonprocurement transaction" in § 180.970 of this title).

(b) A respondent in a suspension or debarment action of the Department.

(c) An ED deciding official; or

(d) An ED officer authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.

##### § 3485.32 What policies and procedures must I follow?

The Department's policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in this part and in Subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified in § 3485.220. Section 180.205 of this title does not require supplementation, so it is not included in the table of contents for this part and is not separately stated in this part.

###### § 5800.765 May I ask the suspending official to reconsider a decision to suspend me?

Yes. Within 30 days of receiving a final notice of suspension, you may make a written request for the suspending official to reconsider your suspension.

###### § 5800.875 May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?

Yes. Within 30 days of receiving a final notice of debarment, you may make a written request for the debarring official to reconsider your debarment pursuant to § 5800.880. The disposition of your request for reconsideration; or the result of your appeal; shall be considered a final agency action.

###### § 5800.880 What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on:

(a) Newly discovered material evidence;

(b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;

(c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

(d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

(e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.

###### § 5800.890 How may I appeal my debarment?

(a) If the Commission debarring official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.870 to debar you after you present information in opposition to a proposed debarment under § 180.815, you may ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:

(1) You may ask the debarring official under § 875 to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or

(2) You may request a review by the EAC's debarment appeals body (DAP), which is composed of the Executive Director, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. The DAP will review your appeal and make a determination on whether to sustain or reverse the decision of the debarring official. The DAP will then make a recommendation to the EAC Commissioners who will vote by circulation on whether to accept or reject the recommendation of the DAP. A request to review the debarring official's decision to debar you must be made within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the DAP may recommend to the EAC Commissioners that the debarring official's decision be reversed, based on a majority vote of the DAP, only where the DAP finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where DAP finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration.

(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page "Debarment Appeal;" state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position. The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 300, Washington, DC 20005.

(c) After the circulation vote of the EAC Commissioners has been certified, either the Commission debarring official or the DAP must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.

(d) [Reserved]

(e) Nothing in this part prohibits the EAC from delegating the appeal review process to another Federal agency through a memorandum of understanding or interagency agreement.
